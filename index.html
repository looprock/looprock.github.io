            <b>Published:</b> 2024-10-25 03:21:32-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            From business meetings to family memories, there are countless reasons to record a phone call, but until now, iPhone users have had to rely on third-party apps or complex workarounds. That changes on October 28 with the release of iOS 18.1, which introduces native call recording and transcription powered by Apple Intelligence.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's marketing chief Greg Joswiak today teased that the company has an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/24/apple-m4-announcements-next-week/">"exciting week of announcements" planned next week</a>. Joswiak said to "Mac" your calendars, and the post includes an animated icon for the Finder app on the Mac, so it is clear that at least some of next week's announcements will be related to the Mac.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's Greg Joswiak today made it clear that Apple plans to reveal new products next week, teasing refreshed Macs. In a social media post, Joswiak said to "Mac your calendars" because there's an exciting week of announcements that start on Monday morning.

<br/>
With Joswiak's announcement, it appears that there will not be a dedicated October event for Macs this year, with Apple instead introducing new products via press release. Monday will see the launch of the iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1 software updates, but new Mac announcements could also start on Monday. In prior years, Apple has done a launch-per-day release schedule for new products when there wasn't an event planned.

            The high-end iPhone 17 Pro Max launching next year will feature a smaller Dynamic Island, according to technology analyst Jeff Pu, who has a fairly good track record with Apple rumors.

<br/>
In a research note with investment bank Haitong International earlier this month, obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>, Pu said the iPhone 17 Pro Max will adopt a "metalens" for Face ID that results in a "much narrowed" Dynamic Island on the device. He does not expect this change to apply to the smaller iPhone 17 Pro, or any other iPhone 17 models.

<br/>
LTPO refers to a TFT panel that adds oxide to a Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Silicon (LTPS) TFT, which reduces power consumption at low refresh rates. Apple applied the name "LTPO3" to the OLED displays used in the recently released Apple Watch 10 series to differentiate it from the LTPO2 displays currently used in Apple Watch Series 9 and iPhone 16 Pro models, as it replaces the drive TFT (thin-film transistor) with a more efficient oxide-based version.
