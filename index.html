            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In the latter days of July in the year 185––, a most important question was for ten days hourly asked in the cathedral city of Barchester, and answered every hour in various ways—Who was to be the new bishop?

The death of old Dr. Grantly, who had for many years filled that chair with meek authority, took place exactly as the ministry of Lord –––– was going to give place to that of Lord ––––. The illness of the good old man was long and lingering, and it became at last a matter of intense interest to those concerned whether the new appointment should be made by a conservative or liberal government.

It was pretty well understood that the outgoing premier had made his selection and that if the question rested with him, the mitre would descend on the head of Archdeacon Grantly, the old bishop's son. The archdeacon had long managed the affairs of the diocese, and for some months previous to the demise of his father rumour had confidently assigned to him the reversion of his father's honours.<br>

Pragmatic assessment of AI's current abilities needed, not overhyped expectations
AI can drive value by augmenting human skills, not just replacing workers
Companies must thoughtfully adapt processes and culture to leverage AI

            Web3 technologies, built on decentralized networks like blockchain, have revolutionized web development. This shift has led to a surge in developers contributing to Web3 applications and platforms. The growth is driven by the popularity of DeFi and NFTs, supported by community initiatives and platforms like Gitcoin. Platforms like Ethereum, Polkadot, and Solana have facilitated this growth. The number of active decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum has significantly increased. The rise in Web3-related repositories on GitHub underscores growing developer interest. The job market for Web3 developers has expanded exponentially, with increased educational efforts to meet demand. DeFi's influence is notable, driving the need for specialized DeFi developers. This global movement indicates the increasing importance of Web3 in shaping the future of decentralized technologies.<br>

There are three new lighting effects designed for the Festavia lights in the Hue app, including Prism, Glisten, and Opal. The effects can also be used with the first-generation Festavia lights, and the Prism effect can be used on all Hue color lights.

A new MR16 Philips Hue bulb adds smart lighting to conventional spotlights. It works on the same 12V voltage as standard MR16 bulbs, so the bulb should fit into most existing fixtures.
