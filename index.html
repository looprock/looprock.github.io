            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            We have pointed out just how ridiculous Elon Musk’s SLAPP lawsuit against the Center for Countering Digital Hate is, so much that I supported the filing of an amicus brief in support of CCDH, even as I find CCDH’s positions and research to be generally problematic and misleading.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-03-01 12:06:41-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Goldman Sachs today increased the Apple Card savings account's balance limit to $1 million, with cardholders being notified by email.

<br/>
From the updated <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/terms-and-conditions/Deposits-Account-Agreement.pdf">Apple Card cardholder agreement</a>, effective March 1:<blockquote>The maximum balance limit for your Account is $1,000,000, based on your Current Balance (including interest and Daily Cash deposits).</blockquote>The account's previous balance limit was $250,000, which is the maximum amount that the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) would cover in the event that Goldman Sachs were to become insolvent. Any deposits above $250,000, up to the new $1 million limit, would not be covered by the FDIC in the event of bank failure.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-03-01 11:15:03-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Spotify, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, Deezer, Paddle, and several other developers and EU associations today <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-03-01/a-letter-to-the-european-commission-on-apples-lack-of-dma-compliance/">sent a joint letter</a> to the European Commission to complain about Apple's "proposed scheme for compliance" with the Digital Markets Act (DMA).

<br/>
The 34 companies and associations do not believe Apple's plans "meet the law's requirements." Apple's changes "disregard both the spirit and letter of the law" and if left unchanged, will "make a mockery of the DMA," according to the letter. Several specific components of Apple's plan are highlighted, including the Core Technology Fee, the Notarization process, and the terms that developers must accept.

            Following intense criticism, Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu">today walked back its plan</a> to disable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> web apps in the European Union starting with iOS 17.4.

Web apps could no longer launch from the ‌Home Screen‌ in their own top-level window that takes up the entire screen, relegating them to a simple shortcut with an option to open within Safari instead.
