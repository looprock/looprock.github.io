            <b>Published:</b> 2024-12-21 16:45:03-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple appears to be internally testing iOS 18.2.1 for the iPhone, based on evidence of the software update in our website's analytic logs this week. The logs have accurately revealed many iOS versions before they were released.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954594" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
iOS 18.2.1 should be a minor update that fixes bugs and/or addresses security vulnerabilities, but it is unclear which specific issues might be resolved. The update will likely be released in late December or early January.
<br/>
<br/>
There could be accompanying updates, such as macOS 15.2.1, but we have not confirmed that.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.2.1 will follow iOS 18.2, which was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/apple-releases-ios-18-2-update/">released earlier this month</a>. iOS 18.2 introduced more Apple Intelligence features for iPhone 15 Pro models and all iPhone 1 [...]<br>

            Apple plans to release a new "HomePod" with a 7-inch LCD display, an A18 chip, and Apple Intelligence support in 2025, according <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20241216PD218/apple-supply-chain-display-lcd-boe.html">to <em>DigiTimes</em></a>.

It is unclear how much the screen-equipped HomePod would cost, but Apple is seemingly aiming for a reasonable price. In a paywalled report this week, the supply chain publication said Apple has selected China-based manufacturer Tianma to supply the LCD panels for the device, at an "exceptionally competitive" price of $10 per panel. The low cost of this component would likely contribute to the device being more affordable.

            OpenAI has expanded the capabilities of its ChatGPT app for macOS, adding support for Apple Notes and a range of popular third-party apps. The update builds on last month's release that introduced the ability to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/14/openai-chatgpt-xcode-for-mac/">read on-screen content from select Mac apps</a>.

<br/>
This expansion should broaden ChatGPT's utility for both casual users and developers using macOS, as the AI assistant can now interact with content in Apple Notes, Notion, and Quip, alongside numerous development environments including BBEdit, Android Studio, and various JetBrains IDEs. 
<br/>
<br/>
For developers, the update also adds support for additional IDEs including VSCode forks (VSCodium, Cursor, WindSurf) and terminal apps like Prompt and Warp. The AI can analyze code from multipl [...]<br>

            Apple launched the controversial "trashcan" <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> eleven years ago today, introducing one of its most criticized designs that persisted through a period of widespread discontentment with the Mac lineup.

<br/>
The redesign took the ‌Mac Pro‌ in an entirely new direction, spearheaded by a polished aluminum cylindrical design that became unofficially dubbed the "trashcan" in the Mac community. All of the ‌Mac Pro‌'s components were mounted around a central thermal dissipation core, cooled by a single fan that pulled air from under the case, through the core, and out the top. The fan could spin more slowly than smaller fans and keep the Mac extremely quiet, even during intense operations.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple plans to launch its next-generation Vision headsets as early as 2026, and they will likely be more affordable, <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20241219-12419.html">according to TrendForce</a>.

<br/>
In line with previous rumors, the Taiwanese research firm today said Apple is planning to introduce both a next-generation Vision Pro and a mainstream headset, which would likely be named "Apple Vision" without the "Pro" modifier.
<br/>
<br/>
For the next-generation Vision Pro, TrendForce said Apple will likely consider sourcing components from suppliers beyond Sony to reduce production costs, and this move could contribute to the headset having a lower price. Currently, the Vision Pro starts at $3,499 in the U.S., and this price has naturally limited sales of the device [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-12-19 04:41:01-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has stopped signing iOS 18.1.1, preventing iPhone users who have upgraded to iOS 18.2 from downgrading to that version of iOS. Apple released iOS 18.2 a week ago on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/apple-releases-ios-18-2-update/">December 11</a>.

<br/>
Apple often stops signing an older version of iOS, usually within a week or two after a new version is released. When an update is no longer signed, it can't be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side software verification check.
<br/>
<br/>
This policy encourages users to keep their operating systems up to date, ensuring they have the latest security enhancements. Apple also stopped signing iOS 17.7.2 on Wednesday.

            Apple is facing calls to remove its AI-powered notification summaries feature after it generated false headlines about a high-profile murder case, drawing criticism from a major journalism organization.
<br/>

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982725" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/bbc-news-headlines-notification-summary.jpg" width="1920"/><div class="center-wrap"><em>Updated to iOS 18.2?

Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has urged Apple to disable the Apple Intelligence notification feature, which rolled out globally last week as part of its iOS 18.2 software update. The request comes after the feature created a misleading headline suggesting that murder suspect Luigi Mangione had shot himself, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd0elzk24dno">incorrectly attributing the false information to BBC News</a>.
