I positioned it as input and guidance into doing your own Kubernetes stuff. My theory on Kubernetes is that everyone wants to do it - “it’s the future” - but very few apps are running in production. Gartner estimates that ‘by 2027, 25 percent of all enterprise applications will run in containers, an increase from fewer than 10 percent in 2021.'" If I wet-finger-in-the-wind it, what I get from that is that right now, in 2023, thee’s something like 12%, at best 15% of apps running in Kubernetes. That’s enough to be very meaningful, but it also means that we have many years of trial and error, discover, and benefits ahead.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> is a standalone hardware device that has its own processors and does not require a connection to a Mac or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to operate, but it is able to interface with other Apple devices. With the Mac, for example, the Vision Pro can serve as a Mac display.

Apple says that there's a Mac Virtual Display feature that works wirelessly with the Mac. You can bring your Mac's display into Vision Pro and "place it anywhere in space." You can see each of your Mac apps individually, arranging them in a way that works for you.

            Starting with iPadOS 17, the built-in camera on the Studio Display and other external displays can be used with iPads for FaceTime calls and other video purposes. This functionality is available on any iPad model equipped with a USB-C port.
