            Fruit Ninja from Halfbrick Studios was developed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> in 2010, and since then, it's been one of the best-known mobile games.

According to Kiani, he has not spoken to anyone from Apple "personally" and no one from Apple has reached out about an agreement. He did say there have been court-ordered mediations he is unable to discuss, and that there are likely to be additional meetings in the future, but he does not believe those meetings will serve as steps to settling the legal dispute with Apple.

            <p>As we look to empower developers with AI tools, we inadvertently integrate AI deeper into the way developers work. How do developers feel about that? And what are the most impactful ways to introduce more AI into workflows? We recently conducted 25 in-depth interviews with developers to understand exactly that.</p>
