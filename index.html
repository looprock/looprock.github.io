            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Sonos plans to raise prices for some of its products later this year because of tariff costs, the company said in its third fiscal quarter earnings presentation [<a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/672173472/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/FINAL-3Q25-Earnings-Slides-POST-CALL-pptx.pdf">PDF</a>].

<br/>
Sonos manufactures its devices in Vietnam and Malaysia, and the countries are facing tariffs of 20 percent and 19 percent, respectively. In the third fiscal quarter, tariffs cost Sonos $2.1 million, and the company estimated that costs would increase to $5 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2025. Sonos said that the estimate for 4Q 2025 reflects the prior 10 percent tariff rate on in-transit inventory that will arrive during the quarter, and future quarters "may differ."

<br/>
In its quarterly earnings reports, Masimo outlines how much it has spent on litigation. The way Masimo's spending is reported has changed over the last five years, but looking at earnings reports give a general idea of the cost to sue Apple and how those costs can balloon.

<br/>
Masimo's ITC case against Apple began in 2021, and it ultimately led to an Apple Watch import ban. Apple was forced to remove blood oxygen monitoring from Apple Watches sold in the U.S. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/apple-watch-removed-from-online-store/">in December 2023</a>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>

<br/>
Companies that are building in the United States, or that have made a commitment to build in the U.S., will not have to pay the tariffs. Since Apple pledged <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/06/apple-american-manufacturing-program/">to spend $600 billion</a> on U.S. manufacturing, the company will presumably be exempted from the planned chip tariffs.
<br/>
<br/>
"If you're building in the United States, or made a commitment to build or are in the process, there's no charge," Trump said. He added that if companies promise to bring manufacturing to the U.S. and don't follow through, tariffs will be "added up" and "charged at a later date."

            In the fifth beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, Apple appears to have subtly upgraded AirPods charging. Code in ‌iOS 26‌ says that the AirPods Charging case "now more clearly indicates charging status," and that the AirPods will remind you when it's time to charge.

A screenshot shared on social media shows an AirPods splash screen with the same wording and an image of what the light on the AirPods charging case means. There are two different shades of amber for Charging and Charge Case, along with a green for Charged status.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Steam will stop supporting macOS 11 Big Sur on October 15, 2025, <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/659D-A19E-018A-81A6">according to Valve</a>, requiring Mac users to upgrade to macOS Monterey or later to continue accessing the gaming platform.

<br/>
The reason Steam will soon stop working on Big Sur is due to the client's reliance on an embedded version of Google Chrome, which no longer functions on older macOS versions. Future Steam updates will also require security features only available in macOS 12 and above.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple also discontinued security updates for Big Sur in 2023, and that's left legacy systems vulnerable to malware that could compromise Steam accounts and game performance. Valve is strongly recommending affected Mac users upgrade before the October deadline.

            Keeping track of missed calls can be challenging if you're juggling several tasks during the day. Thankfully, iOS 26 introduces a streamlined way to set callback reminders directly from the Phone app, making it less likely that you'll forget to return important calls.

<br/>
<h2>Set a Callback Reminder for a Missed Call</h2>
<br/>
When iOS 26 launches this fall (or if you're already on the beta), you'll be able to create callback reminders in the following way:

"Signing" is a server-side verification check that Apple does when a new version of iOS is downloaded on an ‌iPhone‌. An update can't be downloaded and installed unless it passes the verification check, and the unsigning process prevents customers from installing outdated versions of iOS that are less secure.

Apple usually stops signing older software about a week after releasing an update, and doing so ensures that customers have the latest security im [...]<br>
