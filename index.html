            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the iOS 18.3 update, Apple made several changes to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> Notification Summaries feature that aggregates incoming notifications into a single quick-access message.

<br/>
For now, Notification Summaries for the News and Entertainment category have been temporarily disabled, and Apple is working on improvements. Notification Summaries for news will return in a future software update.
<br/>
<br/>
In the Settings app, when a user activates Notification Summaries, Apple has added a warning that this is a beta feature and that there could be errors.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The popular weather app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather-alerts-radar/id961390574">CARROT Weather</a> today was updated with two key new features: CarPlay support and automatic Live Activities.
<br/>

<br/>
When accessed via CarPlay, CARROT Weather becomes a navigation app like Google Maps. You can enter your destination and receive turn-by-turn directions, with the added benefit of being able to view the weather along your driving route. The weather features include live radar, severe weather warnings, wind speeds, visibility levels, and more. 
<br/>
<br/>
CARROT Weather's turn-by-turn directions are as snarky as its weather forecasts, so prepare for remarks such as "turn left on Rodeo Drive, meatbag," or "you went the wrong way, idiot, now I have to recalculate your entire route."

            While the so-called "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/#iphone_17_air">iPhone 17 Air</a>" is not expected to launch until September, there are already plenty of rumors about the "ultra-thin" device.

<br/>
Overall, the "iPhone 17 Air" is shaping up to be a mixed bag. Due to its thinness, the device is expected to have some limited specifications compared to the iPhone 17 Pro models, including only a single rear camera, only a single speaker, no SIM card slot worldwide, and an A19 chip instead of the more powerful A19 Pro chip. Of course, the device will also be equipped with a smaller battery than other iPhone 17 models.
