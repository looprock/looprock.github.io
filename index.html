Like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, macOS Tahoe adopts the Liquid Glass design.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-01 15:40:23-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            CalDigit recently came out with the TS5 Plus, which is designed to work with Apple's Thunderbolt 5 Macs.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012987" height="1216" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/caldigit-ts5-plus.jpg" width="2162"/>
<br/>
The TS5 Plus looks like CalDigit's prior docks, featuring a simple rectangular shape and an aluminum build with some ridging at the top, bottom, and sides for visual interest and heat dissipation.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a black aluminum color that matches the Space Black of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macbook-pro/">M4 MacBook Pro</a> models, and it comes with a hefty 330W power brick. In fact, the power brick is longer than the dock itself, but it's flat and tucks away under a desk fairly well. The TS5 Plus is six inches long, five inches wide, and 1.8 inches thick, while the power brick is seven inches long, 3.5 inches wide, and a little under an inch thick.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, currently in beta, your iPhone gains a handy new charging feature that takes the guesswork out of knowing when your device will be fully powered up. Instead of waiting around or checking your battery percentage every few minutes, you can now see exactly how much time remains until your device reaches 100%.

A real-time estimate appears right in your Battery settings while your iPhone is plugged in, making it ideal for planning your day around charging cycles or working out if you have enough time for a quick top-up before heading out.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's CEO Tim Cook today said the iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26 developer betas are the company's most popular developer betas ever.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
"It's wonderful to see great momentum building for our platforms," said Cook, on a <a href="https://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/">conference call</a> discussing Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/31/apple-3q-2025-earnings/">quarterly earnings results</a>. "iOS 26, macOS 26, and iPadOS 26 are by far the most popular developer betas we've had."
<br/>
<br/>
Apple released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/get-ios-26-developer-beta-iphone/">developer betas</a> immediately following its WWDC 2025 keynote in June.

            While Apple largely won the lawsuit that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> levied against it back in 2020, Google hasn't been as lucky.
