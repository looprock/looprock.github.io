Next week may be busy with the launch of Apple's new Powerbeats that have a heart rate sensor and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> 4, but we could still get the new beta on February 12 or February 13.

According to <em>The Washington Post</em>, the British government has secretly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/07/uk-government-orders-access-icloud/">demanded</a> that Apple give it blanket access to all encrypted user content uploaded to iCloud.
