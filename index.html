With the help of some magnet paper, MKBHD <a href="https://x.com/MKBHD/status/1790718481102434503">reveals</a> that Apple has added bigger, more cubic magnets to the M4 iPad Pro that align with a new longer rail of stripe magnets in the Folio Case, thereby achieving a wider range of viewing angle adjustment.
<br/>
<br/>
The magnet paper also reveals that, because of how thin the new iPad Pro is compared to the previous generation model, Apple has had to use flatter, more circular speaker drivers, which appear to be closer to the top of the device.

<p id="1mSXJX">A week after introducing a redesigned, sleeker app that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151704/sonos-new-app-bad-reviews-missing-features">omitted many core features</a>, Sonos held an Ask Me Anything event <a href="https://en.community.sonos.com/events-at-sonos-229141/sonos-app-redesign-ama-6893676">on its forums today</a>. The purpose was partly to make it clear that customer frustrations are being heard. But as has been the case since last week, the feedback skewed overwhelmingly negative. This company’s community remains pretty damn angry over losing software capabilities like local music search, sleep timers, and more with no warning.</p>
