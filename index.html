            The European Commission has formally announced its preliminary view that Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> policies are in breach of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), specifically in relation to anti-steering rules.

<br/>
Under the DMA, developers distributing their apps via Apple's ‌App Store‌ should be able, free of charge, to inform their customers of alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities, steer them to those offers, and allow them to make purchases. The Commission says that Apple's "business terms" with developers prevent that.

<br/>
The $11.99 standard Premium Individual plan that Spotify offers includes ad-free playback and 15 hours of audiobook listening time per month from a catalog of more than 250,000 titles. Until now, Spotify did not let customers opt for a cheaper plan that did not include audiobook access, as it was automatically bundled in the lowest-tier plan.

            <p>I’ve hosted a lot of executive dinners for work - maybe 50 or 60 over the past several years…? These are commercial oriented. At <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com?utm_source=cote&amp;utm_campaign=devrel&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_content=newsletter20240621">my work</a>, we’re trying to meet new people to sell our software to, or people who know people, etc. Getting to know “executives” is directly related to the sales process. The secondary goal is more brand and thought-leadership marketing: just making the attendee aware of us and what we do, and, hopefully, our “vibe.” And the priorities after those two are what you’d expect: networking, fun/useful conversation, and doing some overall “community management” and participation. </p><p>Here’s some behind the curtain stuff on doing them, especially targeted at people like me who don’t like group conversations.
