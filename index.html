            <b>Published:</b> 2025-05-26 08:48:06-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Nearly three months have passed by since Apple last released new devices, but the AirTag could be receiving an update fairly soon, according to rumors.
<br/>

<br/>
Last year, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman reported that a new AirTag would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/24/airtag-2-mid-2025-rumor/">released around the middle of 2025</a>. In February, a leaker known as Kosutami claimed that Apple planned to release a new AirTag <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/airtag-2-in-may-or-june-rumor/">in May or June</a> this year. If these timeframes remain accurate, an AirTag 2 could launch within the next month. If so, perhaps the AirTag 2 will be announced during the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/apple-announces-wwdc-2025-schedule/">WWDC 2025 keynote on Monday, June 9</a>.
