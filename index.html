            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Vision Pro version of the Apple Developer app has a special immersive Environment included that can be used as a backdrop for watching session videos when WWDC begins next week.

<br/>
Apple's Environment for the Developer app features a black background with neon light animations in the colors of the WWDC artwork that Apple is using this year. It serves as a visually interesting background that's not too distracting for those who want to watch WWDC content with the world shut out.
<br/>
<br/>
The Environment is similar to those that Apple has created for general use, such as Yosemite, Mount Hood, and the Moon. It can be accessed when using the Apple Developer app, and immersion can be adjusted with the Digital Crown.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has tested a redesigned version of Control Center with a customizable layout for iOS 18, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. However, we have not confirmed if this change has been finalized for the update.

The new Control Center would feature a drag-and-drop system that allows at least some of the controls to be reorganized directly on the interface, our sources said. Currently, only the smaller controls in the bottom half of Control Center for things like the flashlight and Low Power Mode can be rearranged or removed through the Settings app.
