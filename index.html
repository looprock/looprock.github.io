            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple relaunched the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> two years ago today, debuting a second-generation model almost five years after the original model's introduction.

<br/>
The original ‌HomePod‌ was announced at WWDC in 2017 and launched in 2018 after a heavily delayed release. The device was met with mixed reviews; critics praised its outstanding sound quality but pointed out its high price, missing features, and limited functionality compared to rivals.

If the variable ‘COGS’ component of marginal API call approaches zero, many of the questions listed above start to go away.
