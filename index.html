            <b>Published:</b> 2024-12-05 10:43:56-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the visionOS 2.2 update that's set to come out next week, Apple is introducing the promised Multiview feature that will let sports fans watch up to five games at once.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955609" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/visionOS-2-on-Apple-Vision-Pro-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
The Multiview feature for the Vision Pro works with MLS and MLB games, but other sports like football and hockey are not supported at this time. Apple offers MLS and MLB games through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+ subscription service because it has partnerships with those leagues. 
<br/>
<br/>
The update adds SharePlay integration so that Vision Pro wearers can view live sporting events together, including multiple games at the same time. 
<br/>
<br/>
Along with the new Multiview and SharePlay features, visionOS 2.2 introduces two new Mac Virtual Display aspect ratios, including 21:9 (wi [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is reportedly planning a significant shift in its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> hardware design by transitioning to discrete memory packaging to enhance on-device AI performance.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-945652" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/apple-silicon-feature-joeblue.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Samsung, a key supplier of Apple's memory components, has begun research to accommodate the change at Apple's request, according to a new report from Korea's <a href="https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=5065"><em>The Elec</em></a>. The shift will mark a departure from the current package-on-package (PoP) method, where the low-power double data rate (LPDDR) DRAM is stacked directly on the System-on-Chip (SoC). Starting in 2026, the DRAM will instead be packaged separately from the SoC, which should significantly improve memory bandwidth and enhance the ‌iPhone‌'s AI capabilities.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In the U.S., the Apple Card offers a high-yield savings account option, allowing you to earn far more interest on your money compared to the average bank's basic savings account. Following a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/05/apple-card-savings-account-dec-interest-rate-cut/">rate cut this week</a>, the account now has an APY of 3.9%. For example, if you deposited $1,000 into the account and maintained that balance for one year, you would earn $39 in interest over that period based on the current APY.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Apple Card's high-yield savings account received an interest rate cut overnight, the fourth time it has done so this year.

<br/>
The ‌Apple Card‌ savings account's annual percentage yield (APY) dropped from 4.1% to 3.9%. Push notifications regarding the cut were sent to ‌Apple Card‌ users on Tuesday evening. Savings account interest rates fluctuate with changes made by the Federal Reserve, and when rates are lowered, banks cut their APYs.

When the ‌Apple Card‌'s savings account first became available, it offered an APY of 4.15%. The rate then increased three times, first to 4.25%, then to 4.35%, and finally to 4.5%, before being lowered to 4.4% in April 2024.
