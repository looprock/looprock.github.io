I positioned it as input and guidance into doing your own Kubernetes stuff. My theory on Kubernetes is that everyone wants to do it - “it’s the future” - but very few apps are running in production.

That’s enough to be very meaningful, but it also means that we have many years of trial and error, discover, and benefits ahead. The 5 years of surveys we have are a good glimpse into what that will look like. &lt;a href="https://</li></ol> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> is a standalone hardware device that has its own processors and does not require a connection to a Mac or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to operate, but it is able to interface with other Apple devices. With the Mac, for example, the Vision Pro can serve as a Mac display.

<br/>
Apple says that there's a Mac Virtual Display feature that works wirelessly with the Mac. You can bring your Mac's display into Vision Pro and "place it anywhere in space." You can see each of your Mac apps individually, arranging them in a way that works for you.

According to Apple, the Vision Pro is meant to serve as a "private, portable 4K display" when used with a Mac. Connecting is as simple as looking at a compatible Mac [...]<br>

            Starting with iPadOS 17, the built-in camera on the Studio Display and other external displays can be used with iPads for FaceTime calls and other video purposes. This functionality is available on any iPad model equipped with a USB-C port.

As it turns out, this feature actually goes beyond external displays. In its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/102/?time=1981">Platforms State of the Union video</a> for developers, Apple revealed that any USB-C webcam can now be used with iPads on a plug-and-play basis, as demonstrated in the video below from Stephen Robles.

            Rumors about Apple's Vision Pro headset have been circulating for years, but something that was never quite clear was how it would be controlled.
