            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            YouTube is deliberately slowing video loading for users with ad blockers enabled, in what appears to be an escalation in Google's campaign against ad-blocking extensions.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is investigating generative AI to accelerate its custom chip design, according to remarks by hardware chief Johny Srouji last month.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945652" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/apple-silicon-feature-joeblue.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Srouji outlined the company's interest in AI-assisted chip design during a speech in Belgium, where he received an award from semiconductor research group Imec. <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/apple-eyes-using-ai-design-its-chips-technology-executive-says-2025-06-18/">Reuters</a></em> was able to review a recording of his remarks.
<br/>
<br/>
"Generative AI techniques have a high potential in getting more design work in less time, and it can be a huge productivity boost," Srouji said. He also talked about the role of electronic design automation companies like Cadence and Synopsys, which he said are "critical in supporting our chip design complexities." Both co [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple won't change the display size of next year's iPhone 18 Pro models, but they'll still look pretty different to what we've generally become accustomed to, rumors are increasingly suggesting.

<br/>
Weibo-based Chinese leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PxgfJh5qk">Digital Chat Station</a> today said that Apple will stick with 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays (rounded up) for the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max, respectively. For context, those are the display sizes of the current iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, and Apple is not expected to change the dimensions for this year's upcoming iPhone 17 Pro devices either.

Despite the unchanged sizes, the leaker corroborated two major revisions to the screens: Apple will move the scanning technology for Face ID under the  [...]<br>

<h2>Web Apps For All Websites</h2>
<br/>
Starting with iOS 26, every website added to the Home Screen via Safari opens as a web app, even if it is not configured to be. On earlier iOS versions, websites that were not configured to open as a web app would open in Safari, meaning that the Home Screen app icons for those websites were effectively just bookmarks.
