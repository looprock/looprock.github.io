            Juno, developer <a href="https://christianselig.com">Christian Selig</a>'s YouTube app for Apple Vision Pro, has received its first update since launching <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/juno-app-youtube-apple-vision-pro/">earlier this month</a>, introducing several user-requested features like the ability to select video quality.

Juno automatically selects the quality of videos based on its "best guess," says Selig, but previously provided no manual control. As of Juno 1.1, however, the UI includes a playback quality option, allowing users to select the resolution of the videos they watch.

<p id="3CCKXp">Chatbots occupy a tricky space for users — they have to be a search engine, a creation tool, and an assistant all at once. That’s especially true for a chatbot coming from Google, which is increasingly counting on AI to supplement its search engine, its voice assistant, and just about every productivity tool in its arsenal. </p>

So I plunked down $20 and decided to see how Gemini Advanced stood up to the rival service.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has made another addition to its growing AI repertoire with the creation of a tool that leverages large language models (LLMs) to animate static images based on a user's text prompts.

Apple describes the innovation in a new research paper titled "<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06071.pdf">Keyframer: Empowering Animation Design Using Large Language Models.</a>" 
<br/>
<blockquote>"While one-shot prompting interfaces are common in commercial text-to-image systems like Dall·E and Midjourney, we argue that animations require a more complex set of user considerations, such as timing and coordination, that are difficult to fully specify in a single prompt—thus, alternative approaches that enable users to iteratively construct and refine genera</blockquote> [...]<br>
