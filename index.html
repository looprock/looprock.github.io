<br/>
<br/>
"The design team doesn't like the look, and the operations team is finding it difficult to make the casing materially cheaper than the current aluminum chassis," he said.

Gurman first mentioned the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/apple-watch-se-with-plastic-casing/">possibility of a plastic Apple Watch SE</a> last year.

            Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1903469694159642784">reiterated</a> that the A20 chip in iPhone 18 models will be manufactured with TSMC's 2nm process.

<br/>
Kuo said TSMC's trial production of 2nm chips has now reached yields well above the 60-70% range. The yield refers to the percentage of functional chips that can be obtained per silicon wafer, which is essentially a large, circular disc of chips.
<br/>
<br/>
Kuo first said that the A20 chip would be 2nm <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/19/kuo-iphone-17-3nm-chips/">around six months ago</a>, and another analyst Jeff Pu <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/iphone-18-a20-chip-2nm-rumor/">said likewise earlier this week</a>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            A few years ago, the American automaker General Motors (GM) announced that it would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/31/general-motors-to-phase-out-apple-carplay/">phasing out support for CarPlay</a> and Android Auto in its new electric vehicles, in favor of its own software platform. It was a controversial decision, as many drivers who are in the market for a new vehicle consider CarPlay to be a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/31/apple-carplay-jd-power-study/">must-have feature</a>.

<br/>
Looking to capitalize on the situation, one GM dealership near Detroit, Michigan last year partnered with a third party to offer an aftermarket CarPlay installation service in GM's newer EV models. But, according to a report this week from &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/gm-just-shut-down-the-only-apple-carplay-retrofit- [...]<br>

The update includes the ability to add up to ten "Topics" to your bio, which can be used to showcase your interests and connect with like-minded users. When someone visits your profile, the topics will be prominently displayed and can be tapped to view related conversations. Meta says this feature is a test, so it might not be around for ever.

Meanwhile, for content creators, Threads is now suggesting trending topics when drafting posts. According to Meta's internal data, posts with tagged topics generally receive more views than those without, so this could potentially offer a boost to creator reach and engagement.

<br/>
Search in Gmail has traditionally returned results from your inbox in chronological order based on keywords. That's not great if the email you need was sent months or years ago. 
<br/>
<br/>
What the new method does to improve things is factor in elements like how often you contact someone, which emails you've clicked the most, and how recently the emails arrived in your inbox.

"With this update, the emails you're looking for are far more likely to be at the top of your search results — saving you valuable time and helping you find important information more easily," claims Google.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple plans to use liquid metal in the hinges of its upcoming foldable iPhone to improve durability and reduce screen creasing, <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1902942517861159377">according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.

<br/>
Apple has reportedly chosen liquid metal, which is manufactured using a die-casting process, as a key component in addressing common issues with foldable devices. The design choice aims to enhance screen flatness and minimize the crease marks that typically plague folding displays.
<br/>
<br/>
Kuo notes that Apple has previously used liquid metal in smaller components like SIM ejector pins, but the foldable iPhone will mark the company's first major use of the material in a critical mechanical part. Dongguan EonTec will reportedly be the exclusive supplier of liquid metal.
