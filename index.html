            Apple will introduce four new iPhones next week, and the standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> will arguably be the least interesting of the bunch.

There are still a handful of features to look forward to, though, which we've outlined below.

The upcoming device, which he refers to as the "Vision Air," will supposedly be over 40 percent lighter than the current model. The Vision Pro weighs in at round 1.375 pounds, so a version that's 40 percent lighter should come in at under a pound.

Kuo also says the Vision Air will be over 50 percent cheaper, which could make it much more attractive to prospective buyers. The Vision Pro costs $3,499, which means a half-priced version would be $1,750.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The lines between iPad and Mac have never been blurrier – and with iPadOS 26, currently in beta and expected later this month, Apple is leaning further into that overlap than ever before. The update brings a suite of powerful new features that elevate the iPad's utility, bridging the gap between touch-first tablet and full-fledged desktop machine.
