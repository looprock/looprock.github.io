CNN recently launched a paid subscription service and began placing more of its reporting behind a paywall. The network now offers a $29.99-per-year articles-only tier and a $69.99-per-year "All Access" plan  [...]<br>

Titled "Peak Performance," the minute-long ad opens with a man running through an arid desert landscape when storm clouds coalesce above him. A drop of water falls from the sky and evaporates on his forehead, providing him with super-human performance and multitasking ability. A voiceover says:
<br/>
<blockquote>The Apple A19 Pro chip is vapor cooled. Because when you run cool, you can push your limits. And juggle over 35 trillion complex tasks a second. Just imagine if we were that powerful...</blockquote>As the man continues to run, he plays the keys on an elongated piano while solving a Rubik's cube with one hand, then breaks through a wall and dashes through a room of singers, before smashing through another wall and eclipsing the camera view.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Earlier this month, the <em>Financial Times</em> reported that Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/15/report-tim-cook-to-step-down-as-soon-as-next-year/">preparing for Tim Cook to step down as CEO of the company "as soon as next year</a>."

<br/>
While the report said that Apple is unlikely to name a new CEO before its next earnings report in late January, it went on to explain that an announcement early in the year would allow for a smooth leadership transition, ahead of Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in June and iPhone event in September.

However, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said he would be "shocked" if Cook steps down between late January and June next year.
