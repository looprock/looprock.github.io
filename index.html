            <b>Published:</b> 2024-06-18 08:17:26-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has suspended work on the second-generation Vision Pro headset to singularly focus on a cheaper model, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-suspends-work-on-next-high-end-headset-focused-on-releasing-cheaper-model-in-late-2025"><em>The Information</em></a> reports.

<br/>
Apple was widely believed to have plans to divide its Vision product line into two models, with one "Pro" model and one lower-cost standard model. The company is said to have been deprioritizing the next Vision Pro headset over the past year, gradually assigning fewer employees to the project.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple first shifted focus to reducing the cost of the first-generation model's components and creating an upgraded display for the next model. Now, the company has apparently told at least one of its suppliers that it has suspen [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-06-18 08:07:47-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In the watchOS 11 beta, the Activity app for Apple Watch lets you schedule custom activity goals for different days of the week, and also lets you pause your goals if you need to rest up.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956025" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/watchos-11-schedule-activity-goals.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
If you tap the +/- button when viewing your Move, Exercise, or Stand goals in the Activity app, a new Change Daily Goal option takes you to a schedule list for the days of the week, allowing you to set each one individually. 
<br/>
<br/>
So if you want to set custom workout goals for, say, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, with lower goals during the weekend, you'll soon be able to do that. 
<br/>
<br/>
This schedule can also be managed through the Fitness app in iOS 18. The Move, Exercise, and Stand activity summaries include the same +/- button that lets you adjust the goal for just today, or adjust your schedule for ea [...]<br>

            Apple is set to conclude a lengthy antitrust investigation by the European Union into its mobile payments system by making significant concessions to give competitors access to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s NFC technology, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fb939c62-4e24-4ffa-8125-b60120c4776e"><em>Financial Times</em></a> reports.

The European Commission charged Apple in 2022 with violating competition law, contending that Apple was preventing competitors from accessing its near-field communication (NFC) technology to favor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>. In response to these charges, Apple apparently made several commitments to the European Commission in January, which now appear to have satisfied the regulators.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple in iOS 18 has given the Calendar app a major update, adding some welcome interface design changes, not to mention long-awaited integration with Reminders.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            T9 dialing, or Text on 9 keys, is a predictive text technology that emerged in the late 90s to make it easier to type text messages on devices with limited input options, such as traditional mobile phones with numeric keypads. Each number key (2-9) on a T9 keypad is mapped to a set of letters. For example, the key "2" corresponds to "ABC," "3" to "DEF," and so on.

            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a> appears to include a new feature that allows an Apple Watch to automatically detect and record when you're taking a nap.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>In 2020, Etsy concluded its migration from an on-premise data center to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). During this transition, a dedicated team of program managers ensured the migration's success. Post-migration, this team evolved into the Etsy FinOps team, dedicated to maximizing the organization's cloud value by fostering collaborations within and outside the organization, particularly with our Cloud Providers.</p>
<p>Positioned within the Engineering organization under the Chief Architect, the FinOps team operates independently of any one Engineering org or function and optimizes globally rather than locally. This positioning, combined with Etsy's robust engineering culture focused on efficiency and craftsmanship, has fostered what we believe is a mature and successful FinOps practice at Etsy.</p>

Maybe even hundreds if the company is large enough, old enough, and has gone through enough acquisitions (most all global banks). </p><p>The more of those platforms your have, the more time you’ll spend managing them, governing them, securing them, and figuring out how to trouble-shoot problems.
