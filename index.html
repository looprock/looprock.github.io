            If there&#8217;s been one recurring theme during the &#8220;AI&#8221; (read, language learning models) revolution, it&#8217;s that the tech sector and greedy financiers are prematurely rushing undercooked technology to market.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple's Podcasts app now shows chapter segments of a podcast when you scrub through a currently playing episode, making it easier to browse through the audio content.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-06-26 04:23:02-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, Apple has added a new "Keep Downloaded" option when browsing items in iCloud, allowing users to designate which files and folders should remain permanently available locally on their device.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956964" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macos-15-keep-downloaded.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
In previous versions of iOS and macOS, users had limited control over which files and folders were kept offline. iCloud's automatic management system would offload files from the device to free up space, potentially removing files that you might want to keep available at all times. 
<br/>
<br/>
Apple offered no straightforward way to prevent this – until now. In macOS Sequoia, when browsing iCloud Drive in Finder, right-clicking a file or folder reveals the new "Keep Downloaded" option. When enabled, the cloud symbol next to the item is opaque instead of transparent, indicating that it wi [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is rumored to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-x/">planning a revamp</a> of the Apple Watch for the device's tenth anniversary, and <em><a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/exclusive-apple-watch-series-10-cad-renders/">91mobiles</a></em> claims to have sourced CAD renders of what could be the "Apple Watch X" or Apple Watch Series 10 from industry insiders.

<br/>
The site claims that the renders are of a "larger" model featuring a 2-inch display. The current Apple Watch Series 9 has a 1.7-inch display, while the Apple Watch Ultra has a display size of 1.93-inches, so this would be the biggest screen on an Apple Watch so far.
<br/>
<br/>
That said, its dimensions are said to measure roughly 46 x 39.7 x 11.6mm, which would make it bigger overall than the Series 9 but smaller than the Ultra. Othe [...]<br>

On the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/apple-seeds-macos-sequoia-beta-2/">macOS Sequoia beta</a>, the Headphone Accommodations options are in the System Settings app under Accessibility → Audio.
