            <b>Published:</b> 2026-01-26 14:38:40-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iOS 26.3, Apple is adding a new "limit precise location" setting that reduces the location data available to mobile networks to increase user privacy.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012692" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iOS-26-Phone-App-Features.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Mobile networks determine location based on the cellular towers that a device connects to, but with the setting enabled, some of the data typically made available to mobile networks is being restricted. Rather than being able to see location down to a street address, carriers will instead be limited to the neighborhood where a device is located, for example.

According to a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/126101">new support document</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models from supported network providers will offer the limit precise location feature.

<p>A Gartner survey of 377 U.S. consumers, conducted in June and July 2025, revealed that rather than shortcutting decisions, AI features are lengthening the research journey. Thirty-one percent of consumers surveyed say AI summaries cause them to spend more time searching for information, compared to just 16% who spend less. Over two-thirds continue past Google’s AI Overview, signaling that summaries are not the final answer. When researching purchases, 31% of consumers consider more product options due to AI overviews, versus only 7% who consider fewer.</p>

<p>You should stay in De Pijp or the Jordaan. These are the neighborhoods just outside of the touristy part of city center that still have all the things you’re thinking of when you think Amsterdam, plenty of nice bars and cafes, hipstery and traditional eateries, excellent architecture and narrow streets, canals, bikes, etc. And yes, plenty of coffee shops (places to buy weed).</p>
<p>If you want more sleepy, but sill urban with stores and coffee ships and stuff, there’s Watergraafsmeer or the even calmer Eastern Docklands.</p>
<p>But I’d stay in De Pijp.</p>
