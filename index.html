            <p>AMM stands for <strong>Automated Market Maker</strong>. It is a type of decentralized exchange (DEX) that is governed by smart contracts. <strong>Think of it as trading tokens without finding someone who wants to buy or sell them.</strong> You trade with a pool of tokens controlled by a smart contract. <strong>But if there is no buyer or seller, who decides the price to sell or buy from?</strong></p>
<p>\
That's a valid question; the price of the tokens in the pool is decided by a mathematical formula that depends on how many tokens are in the pool. The most basic formula is called the <strong>constant product formula,</strong> and it looks like this:</p>

zkEVM, or Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine, is a type of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify the correctness of each program.</p>
<p>\
To understand zkEVM, let's break down its components:</p>
<p>\</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</strong>: This runtime environment facilitates the execution of smart contracts on the Ethereum network. It can execute smart contracts written in Solidity and other Ethereum programming languages.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Zero-Knowledge Proofs</strong>: These cryptographic methods allow one party to prove to another that they know a value x without conveying any information apart from knowing the value x.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now, let's combine these two concepts. <strong>A zkEVM is an EVM that uses zero-knowledge proofs</strong>. This means it can execute smart contracts while verifying the validity of inputs and outputs in the operations of the virtual machine without revealing any additional information.</p> [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-07-04 12:03:09+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture is a decentralized model where each node, or "peer," acts as a client and a server. This contrasts with the traditional client-server model, where a central server provides resources or services, and clients consume them.</p>
<p>\
Here's a detailed breakdown of how P2P architecture works:</p>
<p>\</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Node Equality</strong>: In a P2P network, all nodes are equal. Each node can function as both a server and a client. This means each node can request services (acting as a client) and provide services (acting as a server).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Decentralization</strong>: There is no central server in a P2P network. Instead, tasks and functions are distributed among the nodes in the network. This decentralization makes the network more robust, as there is no single point of failure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resource Sharing</strong>: Each node in the network can share resources, such as processing power, disk storage, or network bandwidth, with other nodes. </p></li></ol> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iPhone users in Australia can now receive next-hour precipitation forecasts and notifications from the Weather app, according to an updated <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211777">Apple support document</a>.

<br/>
"Next-hour precipitation forecasts and precipitation notifications are available for Australia, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States," the document says. "The information is provided by Apple using data from national weather services."

Apple says next-hour precipitation forecasts are "hyperlocal" and "down to the minute." The Weather app can send iPhone users a push notification if it is going to rain in the next hour, and shows how much rainfall is expected by the minute. The feature has been available in the U.S. since the release of iOS 14 in 2020.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Twitter appears to be adopting support for picture-in-picture mode on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, with some Twitter users reporting access to a feature that allows them to watch Twitter videos while doing other tasks on the ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌.

Starting a video in Twitter and then swiping out of the app leaves the video player open, so Twitter users can use other apps while continuing to watch video content from the social network. 
<br/>
<br/>
Twitter has had an in-app picture-in-picture option previously, but the new feature allows Twitter video to be watched while using other apps, similar to how YouTube and other video content apps work on iPhones and iPads.
