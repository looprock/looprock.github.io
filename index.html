            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            A subset of Apple's software engineers started internal development of iOS 19.4 last month, according to the <em>MacRumors</em> visitor logs.

<br/>
iOS 19.4 is expected to be released in March or April next year, so the software update is still nearly a year away. However, Apple develops both "Fall" and "Spring" versions of iOS each year, with our website's analytics logs indicating that both iOS 19.0 and iOS 19.4 are in active development within the company.

<br/>
The start of iOS 19.4 development comes after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">delayed its personalized Siri features</a> until some point "in the coming year."

The facility in Phoenix represents part of a $100 billion investment TSMC pledged in March to make over four years in the American semiconductor industry.
