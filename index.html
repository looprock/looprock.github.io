The iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are expected to debut a major redesign of the rear camera bump, replacing the traditional square module with a horizontal, rectangular bar that stretches across the back of the device. This new layout resembles the runway-style camera panel seen on Google Pixel phones.

When Apple released iOS 18.1, it added a priority messages feature to the Mail app for devices with Apple Intelligence. Then in iOS 18.2, it brought us new Categories that automatically sort your emails into four distinct sections: Primary, Transactions, Updates, and Promotions. The change also added contact photos and business logos for conversations in your inbox.

With the release of iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4, Apple has now fully rolled out these changes across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Fortunately, if you don't like the ne [...]<br>

            WhatsApp is testing a new option that lets you control whether other chat members can export your chats with them or automatically save media you send them, according to <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-ios-25-10-10-70-whats-new/">WaBetaInfo</a>.

<br/>
Referred to as "advanced chat privacy," the new option has a toggle in a recent WhatsApp beta for iOS. By turning it on, you can prevent individual users or people in a group chat from exporting the entire chat history outside of WhatsApp. 
<br/>
<br/>
Enabling the option in a group chat causes everyone in the chat to be notified that advanced chat privacy has been enabled. WaBetaInfo says that turning on the toggle also turns off Meta AI, which lets users interact with a chat bot as part of the wider conversation.

It is typical for Apple to stop signing an older version of iOS after releasing an update, and the process keeps ‌iPhone‌ users from installing outdated versions of iOS.

<br/>
The 26 percent tariff on goods imported from India will be less of a hit to Apple's bottom line than the 54 percent tariff on goods from China, the 46 percent tariff in Vietnam, or the 36 percent tariff in Thailand.
