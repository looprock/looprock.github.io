Apple already uses OLED displays in the iPad Pro. There are apparently no plans to add OLED to the low-cost iPad. The ‌MacBook Pro‌ will be updated with an OLED display when it is next r [...]<br>

<p>Figure 1 shows a steady decline in interstate migration rates between 1996 and 2024 across all age groups. The figure also shows that moving rates are consistently higher for younger adults (25-34) than for older age groups and that mobility has declined within every age group. Thus, the overall decline in the mobility rate (age 25+) is due to a combination of population aging and mobility falling within every age group.</p>

<p>”Organizational interest comes in waves. When it’s reliability time, VPs are desperate to be doing something. They want to come up with plausible-sounding reliability projects that they can fund, because they need to go to their bosses and point at what they’re doing for reliability, but they don’t have the skillset to do it on their own.”</p>
<p>So if you want to get something technical done in a tech company, you ought to wait for the appropriate wave. It’s a good idea to prepare multiple technical programs of work, all along different lines. Strong engineers will do some of this kind of thing as an automatic process, simply by noticing things in the normal line of work.</p>

            <p>Any cloud will do: &ldquo;We believe that the three clouds competitively are on roughly equal footing,” said Goldman Sachs managing director Eric Sheridan. “That’s a very different competitive positioning for Google Cloud now than two or three years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[A] new study from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School complicates the narrative. The study found that 74% of businesses that measure the ROI from their generative AI efforts are already seeing a positive return, and more expect to see a positive ROI within the next two or three years.</p>

<p>Only 57% of those with more than $2 billion in annual revenue said they saw a positive ROI so far.</p>

<p>The Wharton study’s more positive findings stem, in part, from the broader set of use cases it considered. Where the MIT study looked at whether generative AI pilots made it into production and delivered a profit, Wharton’s incorporated </p></blockquote> [...]<br>

            <p>Big layoffs at Amazon corporate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI-driven — not right now, at least,” [the Amazon CEO] said. “Really, it’s culture.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The culture wasn’t right:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>his comments Thursday framed the layoffs as a cultural reset aimed at keeping the company fast-moving amid what he called “the technology transformation happening right now.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Too much middle management?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When that happens, sometimes without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work and who own most of the two-way door decisions – the ones that should be made quickly and right at the front line.”</p>

            Both Google and Apple are cramming new AI features into their phones and other devices, and neither company has offered clear ways to control which apps those AI systems can access.
