            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today announced a "special Apple Experience" in New York, London, and Shanghai, taking place on March 4, 2026 at 9:00am ET.

<br/>
Apple invited select members of the media to the event in three major cities around the world. It is simply described as a "special Apple Experience," and there is no further information about what it may entail. The invitation features a 3D Apple logo design composed of yellow, green, and blue discs.
<br/>
<br/>
It is notable that Apple is specifically using the word "experience," rather than "event." Unlike a full live-streamed event from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a>, the March 4 event in other cities is likely to be smaller in scale.

            Apple's iOS 27 update will prioritize cleaning up the operating system's internals, with engineers making changes that could result in better battery life, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-15/tesla-carplay-delays-related-to-ios-26-and-fsd-apple-s-new-siri-delays-ios-27"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

<br/>
The effort is said to be similar to what Apple did with its Snow Leopard Mac update years ago, and will involve removing old code, rewriting existing features, and subtly upgrading apps to improve their performance.

<br/>
The result should hopefully be a "snappier, more responsive" OS, says Gurman. Apple is also reportedly planning some interface tweaks, but nothing as dramatic as the Liquid Glass overhaul introduced with iOS 26, which will likely  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's autocorrect on iPhone and iPad always aims to help when you're typing a message, but it's by no means perfect, and some of the replacements it continually spews out can be frustrating. Fortunately, Apple's software includes a feature called Text Replacement that allows you to specify what word or phrase replaces the specific text you type in. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="On my way" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036299" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/on-my-way-text-replacement.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
Even if you haven't set up Text Replacement, you can try it out with Apple's pre-set example: In any app that accepts text input, type "Omw" followed by a space, and it will change to "On my way!" automatically.
<br/>
<br/>
The following steps guide you through the process of setting up your own handy shortcut phrases with text replacements on both iOS devices and Mac.
