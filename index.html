            Apple today shared a minute-long video promoting the Emergency SOS feature on the Apple Watch, highlighting the rescue of Australian man Rick Shearman, who was swept out to sea last July.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Shearman was swimming in Byron Bay when rough seas pushed him away from shore, with the current carrying him over 1.5 kilometers from the beach. He couldn't get past the waves, and after about 20 minutes of trying to get to shore, he realized he needed help.
<br/>
<br/>
He called emergency services using the Emergency SOS feature on his Apple Watch, with the call played back in Apple's ad spot in a dramatic reenactment of the event. He was able to source help, and stayed on the line with emergency crews for an hour to direct them to his location. He was ultimately rescued by helicopter.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple stock is on the rise after U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to pause most tariffs for a 90-day period. Tariffs are immediately on hold in countries that have not enacted retaliatory tariffs, which means this pause does not apply to China, but it is applicable in other countries where Apple suppliers operate like India, Vietnam, and Taiwan.

<br/>
While Trump has paused tariffs in most countries, he raised tariffs on incoming Chinese goods to 125 percent, up from 104 percent earlier today. The 125 percent tariff is effective immediately, and comes after China raised tariffs on U.S. goods to 84 percent this morning.

            Apple employees are testing iOS 18.4.1 for iPhones, according to the <em>MacRumors</em> visitor logs, which have been a reliable indicator of upcoming iOS versions. The software update will likely be released in a week or two, if not sooner.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Postgres is a data storage tool, and as a tool it is neutral in how it is used.  Tools can be used for good, for harm, and because Postgres is open source, the community doesn't even
know how it is used.
</p>
<p>My first knowledge of non-traditional uses of Postgres was in 2003 during a Postgres <a class="txt2html" href="https://bignerdranch.com/" style="text-decoration: none;">training.</a>  During a break, someone whispered to me that one of the
attendees was from a pornographic video company, and that Postgres was very popular in that industry.  The more I thought about it, the more it made sense — many database companies
didn't want to do business with them, but Postgres was open source so they could use it easily.
</p>
<p>The flexibility of Postgres to be used without restrictions didn't become apparent to me again until 2014, when Russia invaded

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has lost its position as the world's most valuable public company to Microsoft following a dramatic four-day slide in its stock price, driven largely by concerns over President Donald Trump's escalating tariff war with China, where most of its iPhones are assembled.

<br/>
Apple's market capitalization fell to $2.59 trillion as of Tuesday's close, while Microsoft now sits at $2.64 trillion, reclaiming the top spot after briefly holding it earlier this year.
<br/>

Apple shares have plummeted approximately 23% over just four trading sessions, shaving $700 billion off its value, as panicked investors dump stock due to the company's exposure to China for manufacturing and sales.

The deal runs until April 24, 2025, and offers a decent discount from the regular $9.99 monthly subscription price, saving viewers $21 over the promotional period.
<br/>
<br/>
The offer comes as Apple TV+ has been boosted in popularity with hit shows like "Severance," which recently surpassed "Ted Lasso" as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/severance-more-popular-than-ted-lasso/">platform's most-watched series</a>.

            Apple urgently requested suppliers to ship as many premium devices as possible to the United States by air freight, especially those priced above $3,000, in response to President Donald Trump's announcement of "reciprocal" tariffs of up to 104% on trading partners (via <em><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Tech-Asia/From-Apple-to-Samsung-Trump-s-tariffs-force-supply-chains-to-adapt-fast">Nikkei</a></em>).

Apple, along with Dell, Microsoft, and Lenovo, reportedly scrambled to mitigate the impact of the tariffs by accelerating shipments before April 9, the day the tariffs came into effect.
