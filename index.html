            <b>Published:</b> 2025-01-21 15:14:17-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iOS 18.3, Apple made a small but meaningful change to the way the Calculator app works, reintroducing repeating operations. When you tap the equals sign twice, the app will now repeat the last mathematical operation.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960038" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iOS-18-Calculator-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
So, for example, if you type in 5x5 and tap the equals sign, you'll get 25 as a result. If you hit the equals sign again, it will multiply 25x5, and will continue multiplying by 5 every time you tap the equals symbol.
<br/>
<br/>
Repeating operations were an option in the Calculator app prior to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, but ‌iOS 18‌ removed the functionality. Users who have missed the feature will get it back after updating to iOS 18.3. Being able to repeat operations is useful for calculating compound interest.

            Apple's next-generation iPad Air and entry-level iPad models have seemingly been confirmed today by known leaker Evan Blass.

In a private <a href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1881274150351962611">social media post</a>, Blass shared an image of what appears to be source code mentioning unreleased 11-inch iPad Air, 13-inch iPad Air, and iPad 11 models.

<br/>
Last year, the U.S. passed a law that required Chinese company ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok due to potential national security risks, or else the social media platform would be banned. That law <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/tiktok-january-19-ban-imminent/">went into effect today</a>. TikTok is still owned by ByteDance, so <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/18/apple-removes-tiktok-from-app-store-in-us/">Apple removed the app from the App Store in the U.S.</a>, pursuant to the law.

            <p>Please considering joining us next month (February 2025) for a discussion of Heikki Linnakangas's talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBPubrwGKhI" target="_blank">The Wire Protocol</a>, from PGCONF.EU 2024. For those not familiar with the concept, this hacking workshop is basically a virtual meetup: you watch the talk, and then you sign up to participate in one of two or three Zoom meetings where we discuss the talk. Usually, we're able to get the original author of the talk to join us; thanks to Heikki for agreeing to join us this month.<span></span></p><a href="https://rhaas.blogspot.com/2025/01/postgresql-hacking-workshop-february.html#more">Read more »</a><br>
