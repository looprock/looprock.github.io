<p id="ahHZWN">Google <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/03/blog-post.html">has added</a> real-time browsing protection to Chrome that it claims should protect your privacy. The feature, which Google says hides your visited URLs, is now available on the default Standard mode of Safe Browsing on Chrome.</p>
<p id="WAuNrK">For years, Chrome’s Safe Browsing feature has automatically added potentially unsafe URLs to a list Google stores on your device. Every time a user visits a site, Google checks the URL against that list and issues a warning. The problem is that Google only updates this locally stored database every 30 to 60 minutes.

The Standard protection for Chrome previously used a list that is stored on device and updated every 30 to 60 minutes, but now websites will be checked against Google's server-side list of known bad sites in real time.

            Apple's first-generation Vision Pro headset is an "over-engineered devkit" that ships with more sensors than is necessary to deliver Apple's intended experience. That's according to Hugo Barra, former VP of Android and head of Meta's phased-out Oculus headset brand.

            Yelp develops two major applications, Yelp &amp; Yelp for Business, for Web (Desktop &amp; Mobile), iOS, and Android platforms. That’s eight unique clients! Keeping a fresh, consistent UI on all these clients is a major challenge. Server-driven UI (SDUI) has become a standard industry technique for managing UI on multiple platforms. At Yelp, many product teams created SDUI frameworks for their features. Though successful, these frameworks were expensive to develop and maintain, and no single SDUI framework supported all our clients. In late 2021, we began building a unified SDUI framework called CHAOS or “Content Hosting Architecture with Optimization Strategies”....<br>

            The U.S. House of Representatives today approved legislation that would force TikTok owner ByteDance to sell the social media network or face a ban in the United States. The Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act will now go to the Senate, where its fate is unclear.

<br/>
U.S. lawmakers want TikTok to be sold to a company outside of China due to concerns that the Chinese government could force ByteDance to hand over data from users located in the United States. If China made the request, ByteDance would not be able to refuse. There have also been suggestions that China could use TikTok to spread political propaganda.

ByteDance has attempted to alleviate these fears by storing data from U.S. users on servers owned by Oracle, but the White House and lawmakers do not believe that is enough.

            What is Engineering Effectiveness Metrics (EE Metrics)? EE Metrics was envisioned as a hub that helps teams manage their technical debt. EE Metrics provides every team with a detailed web page that contains information about technical debt that needs to be addressed. It also serves as a platform to highlight top engineering initiatives at the organization level. EE Metrics empowers infrastructure teams to surface important migrations or metrics that could improve the health of software projects. Organization-wide migrations of technologies can often be difficult to surface and keep track of. General EE Metrics lifecycle Figure 1: Diagram showing how EE...<br>
