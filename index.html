Weibo-based account <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/QcTp2F1Jp">Digital Chat Station</a> said Apple's development of under-screen camera technology was progressing as planned for adoption in 2027, one year after it will reportedly debut <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-18-pro-under-screen-face-id-rumor/">under-screen Face ID technology</a> on iPhone 18 Pro models.

<p>The conclusion here is clear: the industry will want different things from you as it evolves, and it will tell you that each of those shifts is because of some complex moral change, but it’s pretty much always about business realities changing. If you take any current morality tale as true, then you’re setting yourself up to be severely out of position when the industry shifts again in a few years, because “good leadership” is just a fad."</p>

            <p>Enterprises are till trying to figure out DevSecOps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[M]any organizations remain stuck in siloed approaches that pose problems due to competing demands for speed, efficiency and risk reduction. Enterprises that effectively integrate security into software development and deployment–both through platforms and tools, and via cross-team collaboration– are better positioned to drive velocity, quality and innovation while maintaining and even improving security."</p>
<p>Also, if you must Kubernetes, try to run just one, or as few as possible: ”given the array of tools and personas involved, organizations must contend with complexity, staffing and other hurdles in addition to cost, security and integration issues. Thus, it is critical to leverage a single platform that integrates the many open-source components of an effective Kubernetes deployment and supports the different personas (e.g., cloud admins, platform engineers and security teams) involved.”</p>
