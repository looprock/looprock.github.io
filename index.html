            <b>Summary:</b><br>

<br/>
The public will be able to test upcoming AirPods firmware updates through the free <a href="https://beta.apple.com/">Apple Beta Software Program</a>, with no Apple Developer account required.

<br/>
"New public betas for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, tvOS 26, HomePod software 26, watchOS 26, <strong>and AirPods Firmware</strong> are coming soon," says Apple.

<br/>
In a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/airpods-now-more-versatile-with-studio-quality-audio-recording-and-camera-remote/">press release</a>, Apple said that the first AirPods firmware public beta will be available in July.

            Apple Watches are gaining support for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/334/?time=239">custom Control Center controls</a>.

<br/>
Starting with watchOS 26, controls that are available in the Control Center gallery on an iPhone are automatically available on the Apple Watch as well. This is true even if the iOS app offering the control lacks a corresponding watchOS app. When you tap on one of these controls, the action is performed on the companion iPhone.
<br/>
<br/>
watchOS app developers can also create entirely new custom controls for watchOS, and in this case the action is performed on the Apple Watch directly.
<br/>
<br/>
The custom controls can even be assigned to the Action button on all Apple Watch Ultra models.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today added the iPhone XS to the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102772">vintage products list</a> on its website.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Apple considers a device to be "vintage" once five years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale. Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers may still offer repairs for vintage devices, subject to parts availability.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple released the iPhone XS in September 2018, and it was discontinued a year later. However, the device remained available through select resellers for longer, so it has only recently reached the five-year mark for vintage status.
<br/>
<br/>
In two more years from now, the iPhone XS will be classified as fully obsolete, at which point Apple will no longer service the device.
