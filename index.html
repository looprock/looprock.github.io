            Hollywood directors and actors have been protesting and blaming artificial intelligence for the loss of jobs in their industry. However, history has proved that such fears are often unfounded. New technologies often complement existing ones, leading to the expansion of opportunities rather than their extinction. AI has the potential to enhance the creative process and revolutionize how films and TV shows are dubbed and translated.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If you change your iPhone's passcode and forget it soon after, iOS 17 has a new option available to help out. Specifically, it is now possible to reset an iPhone's new passcode with the previous passcode for up to 72 hours after the change is made.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-900578" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/iOS-17-Passcode-Reset-72-Hours-Feature.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
If you enter an incorrect passcode, tapping on "Forgot Passcode?" at the bottom of the screen will lead to another screen with a "Try Passcode Reset" option. Tapping this option allows you to enter the iPhone's previous passcode and create a new passcode.
<br/>
<br/>
As a safeguard, an option in the Settings app lets you expire the previous passcode immediately so that it cannot be used to reset the new passcode.

"Certain models of internal SATA drives might unexpectedly disconnect from your computer after your Mac wakes from sleep," said Apple. "This can occur if your Mac automatically goes to sleep or if you manually put your Mac to sleep. If you see a message that your disk was not ejected properly, you can restart your Mac to reconnect to the drive."
