            Amazon <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/amazon-new-echo-devices-alexa-plus">today announced</a> the launch of new Echo Dot Max, Echo Studio, Echo Show 8, and Echo Show 11 smart speakers, all of which are designed to work with <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-generative-artificial-intelligence">Amazon's Alexa+ AI assistant</a>.

<br/>
The new speakers have faster chips with AI acceleration, and a custom sensor platform called Omnisense. Omnisense was created for ambient AI, and it leverages sensors and signals to act on events that are happening in the home. Amazon says it can do things like provide a reminder when a specific person walks in a room, or send an alert that the garage door is unlocked and it's after 10 p.m.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-30 15:48:32-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has seemingly confirmed Apple's work on an updated version of the Vision Pro headset.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1021632" height="626" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/fcc-vision-pro-leak.jpg" width="1110"/>
<br/>
One of several documents the FCC shared today references an Apple-designed "Head Mounted Device" with a model number of A3416. An included image confirms the device is a Vision Pro.
<br/>
<br/>
The FCC's uploads are transmission tests, SAR test reports, and WLAN test reports, so there's not a lot of additional product information available.
<br/>
<br/>
According to rumors, Apple is working on a refreshed version of the Vision Pro that has a faster M5 chip. The headset isn't expected to feature design updates, with Apple simply updating the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip to a newer, more capable M-series chip. The updated Vision Pro could launch befor [...]<br>

The FCC published documents that reference model numbers that do not correspond with existing devices.

            OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/sora-2/">today announced</a> the launch of Sora, an invite-only AI video app and social network. Sora lets you create realistic AI videos of yourself, friends, and other people.

<br/>
Sora uses the Sora 2 video generation model, which OpenAI says is more physically accurate, realistic, and controllable than prior systems. It is able to generate complex movements while better obeying the laws of physics, and OpenAI says it excels at realistic, cinematic, and anime styles.
<br/>
<br/>
Sora 2 supports generating video that also includes audio, such as real-sounding speech, background soundscapes, and sound effects.

The AI model is able to observe a video of a person and then insert them into a Sora-generated environment while accurately portraying their appearance and voice, wh [...]<br>

            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> features the first redesigned form factor that Apple has come out with in several years, but it's not without compromises because of its thin design. <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera has been using the ‌iPhone Air‌ as his main device for the last two weeks to see if those compromises are worth dealing with day-to-day.

The "awe" feeling of using a lightweight, compact <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> doesn't go away over time, and it's still a delight to use such a thin device. 6.5 inches is an ideal screen size, and even though it's a large phone, it's not heavy. If you've ever had hand strain from using a brick-like ‌iPhone‌ Pro or Pro Max, the Air will be a relief. It's just all-around [...]<br>

            An apparent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnzkC2q-iGI">unboxing video</a> for an unannounced iPad Pro with the M5 chip was uploaded to YouTube today by Russian channel Wylsacom.

<div class="center-wrap"></div>

The same YouTube account <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/alleged-m4-macbook-pro-unboxing-video/">leaked the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 chip</a> before it was announced by Apple last year, so this is likely a legitimate leak.

<br/>
Based on the box shown in the video, this appears to be a 13-inch iPad Pro with an M5 chip, 256GB of storage, and a Space Black finish. The new iPad Pro does not have any noticeable external design changes compared to the current models with the M4 chip, with features like a single rear camera, four speakers, and a Smart Connector still visible. At a glance, it looks like the 13-inch iPad Pro's impressive 5.1mm thinness is preserved.

Apart from cleaner-looking frosted buttons and a more minimalist bottom, the MX Master 4 looks very similar to the S3.

Opera first previewed Neon in May and is now gradually rolling out invites to waitlist members.

Neon can open and close tabs, compare information across multiple sources, and even complete transactions on a user's behalf.

<br/>
Sleep apnea is a condition in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep, often leading to poor rest. The Apple Watch detects signs of the disorder by using its accelerometer to track subtle wrist movements associated with irregular breathing patterns. When these disturbances occur repeatedly across several nights, the watch can flag a potential case of sleep apnea.
<br/>
<br/>
The feature is supported on the Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, Series 11, Apple Watch Ultra 2, and Apple Watch Ultra 3, and is available in more than 150 countries world [...]<br>

            <p>&lsquo;JFrog Fly is the company’s agentic developer platform and an MCP server that works with multiple IDEs, including VS Code and Cursor. Integrated with GitHub and observability, Fly provides a chat interface that allows users to query, promote, and roll back existing releases based on specifics of the code (e.g., “Which features were added to this release?” or “Deploy the release that added styling to the user field”). Fly includes an audacious reimagining of the software development process, making versioning automatic and version names obsolete. This makes for a slick demo but may introduce confusion for JFrog clients who don’t want to give up their semantic versions or who need to support back-level software.&rsquo;</p>

            Anthropic today introduced Claude Sonnet 4.5, which the company says is the "best coding model in the world," outperforming GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro. It's also the strongest model for building complex agents and using computers, plus Anthropic says that it shows substantial gains in reasoning and math compared to Opus 4.1.
