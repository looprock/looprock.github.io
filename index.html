Following the discontinuation of its controversial FineWoven cases, Apple is apparently planning to debut a new attempt at a leather-alternative fabric case this year alongside the ‌iPhone 17‌ lineup. The new synthetic fabric will reportedly feature a more technical and less luxurious design.

            Apple's divisive new Liquid Glass design language in iOS 26 could be hinting at a major hardware redesign coming to future iPhones, reckons veteran app developer Craig Hockenberry of The Iconfactory.

<br/>

In a blog post published this week titled "<a href="https://furbo.org/2025/08/17/liquid-glass-why/">Liquid Glass.
