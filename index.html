            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Starting next week, Apple's retail stores will no longer offer AppleCare+ plans as a one-time purchase, according <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1886083012967948722">to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

<br/>
Instead, he said the stores will only offer AppleCare+ as a subscription. For example, AppleCare+ for the iPhone 16 Pro Max costs $9.99 per month, or $199 upfront for two years. The latter option would no longer be available at Apple's stores.
<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, Gurman said AppleCare+ will remain available as a one-time purchase on Apple's online store, at least for now.
<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear if this policy change is limited to the U.S. or will apply worldwide.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple likely profits more by offering AppleCare+ as a monthly or annual subscription, which helps to boos [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Glauber Costa, co-founder and CEO of Turso, joins us to discuss libSQL, Limbo, and how they're rewriting SQLite in Rust. We discuss their efforts with libSQL, the challenge of SQLite being in the public domain but not being open for contribution, their choice to rewrite everything with Limbo, how this all plays into the future of the Turso platform, how they test Limbo with Deterministic Simulation Testing (DST), and their plan to replace SQLite.<br>
