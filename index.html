            Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/retail/saintecatherine/">Sainte-Catherine store</a> in Montréal, Canada has a new home at the northeast corner of Rue Saint-Catherine and Rue de la Montagne. The location <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/01/the-new-apple-sainte-catherine-opens-today-in-montreal/">officially opened to the public today</a>, and the first people who visited received a complimentary tote bag and toque (the Canadian term for what Americans call a beanie), the latter of which will come in handy given Montréal's temperature is currently hovering around -15ºC (5ºF).

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Ever searched for something specific, only to be met with results that are <em>close, but not quite</em>? On Etsy’s Search Relevance team, that frustration is exactly what we are tackling. Our goal is simple yet ambitious: to help buyers find exactly what they’re looking for, and to help sellers reach the people seeking their special products.</p>
<p>Search plays a central role in that mission. Historically, Etsy’s search models have relied heavily on engagement signals – such as clicks, add-to-carts, and purchases – as proxies for relevance. These signals are objective, but they can also be biased: popular listings get more clicks, even when they’re not the best match for a specific query.</p>
<p>To address this, we introduce semantic relevance as a complementary perspective to engagement, capturing how well a listing aligns with a buyer’s intent as expressed in their query. We developed a <strong>Semantic Relevance Evaluation and Enhancement Framework</strong>, powered by large language models (LLMs). It</p> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple increasingly has to compete with other companies for chips made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), as surging demand for artificial intelligence reshapes capacity and customer priority.

<br/>
According to a detailed report published by semiconductor analyst Tim Culpan on his blog <em><a href="https://www.culpium.com/p/exclusiveapple-is-fighting-for-tsmc">Culpium</a></em>, Apple is no longer guaranteed preferential access to leading-edge manufacturing capacity at TSMC, marking a notable change after more than a decade in which Apple's chips were central to the foundry's expansion strategy. Apple is now competing directly with AI-focused customers such as Nvidia and AMD for supply, particularly at the most advanced process nodes.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Development of Apple's rumored OLED MacBook Pro took another forward step this month when the next-generation production line responsible for manufacturing its displays commenced operation.

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984552" height="1265" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/M6-MacBook-Pro-Feature-1.jpg" width="2250"/>
<br/>
Samsung Display is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/oled-macbook-pro-coming-next-year/">expected</a> to make the panels for Apple's MacBook Pro, and has invested heavily in an 8.6-generation OLED production line located at its Asan campus in South Korea. 
<br/>
<br/>
An 8.6G fab uses much larger glass substrates than the OLED lines used for smartphones, which allows multiple laptop-sized panels to be cut from a single sheet. This improves yields and lowers costs, which is just what Apple needs if OLED is to replace mini-LED in the MacBook Pro.

The line is designed around rigid OLED panels with oxide TF [...]<br>

            Apple's foldable iPhone will share the same next-generation A20 Pro chip as the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max models when it debuts this September, according to industry analyst Jeff Pu.

Through dramatic scale and surreal energy, the campaign transforms LA into Ohtani's playground—a cityscape where sport and culture intersect.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            An unreleased Apple monitor with the model number A3350 surfaced in a Chinese regulatory database today, according to a filing viewed by <em>MacRumors</em>.

<br/>
The filing is likely for Apple's next-generation Studio Display or Pro Display XDR, but there is not enough information to determine which one it will be.
<br/>
<br/>
The listing does reveal that the new model will be equipped with a high-performance LCD display. The existing Studio Display and Pro Display XDR both have an LCD panel, so unfortunately this information does not help to pinpoint things. However, it does seemingly rule out an OLED display for this new model in particular.

Notably, the AI can now operate within the context of specific tabs or tab groups, so it doesn't mix up information across different browsing sessions. There's also a new YouTube integration that lets the AI analyze videos to find specific moments or summarize content.

            <p>Check this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlSem-r2n30">out from my pal DaShaun</a>: in May of 2025, 60% of Spring Boot downloads were for versions no longer supported by the open-source project. That’s a lot. Too much, really.</p>
<p>I can see how it happens. You get an app into production, it runs fine, and then you moveon to the next thing. Meanwhile, the version drifts into “End of Life” territory. OSS support ends (like way back in mid-2023 for the Spring version DaShaun mentioned). If you’re running that today without a commercial contract, you are missing over a dozen essential security patches. Or hoping you can handle it yourself…</p>
<p>Better options are:</p>

<li>
<p>Upgrade: Move to the supported versions (Spring Boot 3.x or the new 4.x). We have a tool, the Application Advisor, that automates a massive chunk of this migration.
