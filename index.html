            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 are among the latest additions to the Apple Watch lineup, so how do they compare?
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-970589" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-vs-Series-10-Buyers-Guide.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Both the Apple Watch Series 11 and the Apple Watch Ultra 3 feature hypertension detection, Sleep Score, sleep apnea detection, speaker playback, an Always-On Retina display, IP6X dust resistance, and more, but there are still significant differences between the two devices. The Apple Watch Ultra focuses on withstanding extreme environments, a high level of durability, extended battery life, and additional features to aid activities like diving and exploration.

            iOS 26 was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-26-mega-guide/">finally released</a> on Monday, but the software train never stops, and the first developer beta of iOS 26.1 will likely be released soon.

<br/>
iOS 18.1 was an anomaly, as the first developer beta of that version was released in late July last year, to allow for early testing of Apple Intelligence features. The first betas of iOS 15.1, iOS 16.1, and iOS 17.1 were all released in the second half of September, so it is likely the iOS 26.1 beta cycle will begin this month.

<br/>
The ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ starts at $1,099 and the ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max starts at $1,199. For the Pro model, this is a $100 price increase over last year's model, but there is also no longer a 128GB storage configuration available for this device, meaning that it is effectively only a price hike if you normally buy this model. In fact, if you normally buy the 256GB model, it represents a $100 price cut.

            Fresh off of kissing Trump&#8217;s ass to gain regulatory approval for Skydance&#8217;s merger with CBS and Paramount, the billionaire Ellison family is cooking up another terrible idea: quickly merging with whatever&#8217;s left of Time Warner. You might recall that the AT&#38;T&#8211;>Time Warner&#8211;>Discovery mergers were some of the most destructive and pointless &#8220;business&#8221; efforts ever conceived, [&#8230;]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>The new Use Model shortcut in Apple Shortcuts opens up a lot of possibilities. For example, I like to summarize a lot of pages. Sometimes, ChatGPT can’t get the text for those pages, or I don’t trust the text it retrieves. There’s a shortcut that will retrieve the cleaned up text of a page (as markdown). So, you can get that markdown, and with the new Use Model shortcut, you can summarize it and then send the markdown summary to Drafts. You could open the text up in another app to view, whatever you like, but as you can imagine, I like to catalog this stuff. Also, it can generate a little link to include for my newsletters link list.</p>
<p>You put this in your Sharesheet, and now when you’re reading the World Wide Web, you can get summaries real quick-like.</p>

The third-generation AirPods Pro Charging Case is equipped with a U2 chip – a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip that enables Precision Finding.

<h1>How big the Kubernetes market?</h1><p>TAM-time for <em>managing</em> Kubernetes:</p><blockquote><p>The container management market has grown more than 20% over the past year, with a market value of over $2.5 billion in 2024. The market is forecast to exceed $4.5 billion in constant currency by 2028, with a 17.6% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-2LKN2WQC&amp;ct=250730&amp;st=sb">Gartner, August, 2025</a>.</p></blockquote><p>That TAM means that every vendor looking to sell Kubernetes is competing for slice of $3bn to $4bn pie. So, take the marketshare of Amazon, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud, IBM Red Hat, VMware, and nine other vendors that made the MQ cut. Assume that the top three have something like 30% o 40% of the market divided among them. Then the next three have 15% to 20% divided among them. And the remaining</p> [...]<br>

            <p>In my searches/research, analysts like Gartner, IDC, and Forrester are invisible to ChatGTP, Claude, etc. The robots will find the reports licensed by vendors - I&rsquo;m guessing only if they don&rsquo;t require leadgen.</p>
<p>The analysts should probably start publishing some juicy abstracts with just enough numbers, analysis, and advice to get into the training data and search results to get people to funnel to their pages. Of course, converting a rando-click to <a href="https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US53030225&amp;pageType=PRINTFRIENDLY&amp;algoliaQueryID=&amp;indexName=">a $95,000 PDF</a> would be some real funnel-management magic.</p><br>
