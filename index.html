<br/>
Instead of the familiar split between standard and Pro models, Apple has introduced the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Air, expanded the feature gap between tiers, and refined each model to serve a clearer audience. The result is a four-device family that ranges from the affordable and practical <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> to the feature-packed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> Max, with distinct trade-offs in size, materials, camera hardware, and battery life along the way.

            Apple has added a "groundbreaking" new memory security feature to its new iPhone 17 lineup called Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE), which the company describes as "the most significant upgrade to memory safety in the history of consumer operating systems."

The new security feature targets spyware tools like Pegasus that exploit vulnerabilities to hack targeted devices.
