The ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ starts at $1,099 and the ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max starts at $1,199. For the Pro model, this is a $100 price increase over last year's model, but there is also no longer a 128GB storage configuration available for this device, meaning that it is effectively only a price hike if you normally buy this model. In fact, if you normally buy the 256GB model, it represents a $100 price cut.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>The new Use Model shortcut in Apple Shortcuts opens up a lot of possibilities. For example, I like to summarize a lot of pages. Sometimes, ChatGPT can’t get the text for those pages, or I don’t trust the text it retrieves. There’s a shortcut that will retrieve the cleaned up text of a page (as markdown). So, you can get that markdown, and with the new Use Model shortcut, you can summarize it and then send the markdown summary to Drafts. You could open the text up in another app to view, whatever you like, but as you can imagine, I like to catalog this stuff. Also, it can generate a little link to include for my newsletters link list.</p>
<p>You put this in your Sharesheet, and now when you’re reading the World Wide Web, you can get summaries real quick-like.</p>

The third-generation AirPods Pro Charging Case is equipped with a U2 chip – a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip that enables Precision Finding.
