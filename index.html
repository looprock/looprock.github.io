            <p>\
Most problems we face at work involve people. We think we know others, how they think, and what drives them. But most of the time, we’re wrong. We look at others from our self-centered view of the world and make assumptions about other people’s behaviors and actions.</p>
<p>\
Others seem to be a source of our problem, not because they are who we think they are, but how we interpret them—what assumptions we make about them, what beliefs we impose, and what expectations we have from them.</p>
<p>\
You can’t be empathetic towards others and lead with your beliefs and notions. To build empathy at work, you have to be less wrong when judging other people’s behaviors and actions. You have to stop making assumptions about their circumstances and motivations. You have to step into their shoes to understand what they’re really thinking.</p>

            Apple will likely release the second-generation HomePod and the HomePod mini in Israel soon, as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/18/apple-releases-ios-16-6-rc/">iOS 16.6 Release Candidate</a> adds Hebrew support for Siri on the HomePod, according to <a href="https://theverifier.co.il/60786/siri-homepod-hebrew-support-ios-16-6/">Israeli website <em>The Verifier</em></a>. Apple does not have an online store or retail stores in Israel, so the speakers would be sold at authorized resellers in the country.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-07-20 06:25:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple plans to add Wi-Fi 6E support to some of its latest iPhones, according to a research note today from Barclays analysts Blayne Curtis and Tom O'Malley.

The UK government is planning to update the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA), which came into effect in 2016. The Act of Parliament allows the British Home Office to force technology companies to disable security features like end-to-end encryption without telling the public. The IPA also enables storage of internet browsing records and authorises the bulk collection of personal data in the UK.

            Apple's launch of the iPhone 15 series could be delayed by a "few weeks," pushing the debut of the company's next-generation smartphone lineup beyond its usual September timeframe, according to Wamsi Mohan, a global securities analyst at Bank of America.

Mohan shared his prediction in a research note obtained by <em><a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/apple-earnings-iphone-sales-delay-47247f90">Barrons</a></em> after conducting channel checks in Apple's supply chain. Mohan said the launch looked like it could slip into the fourth quarter, which runs through October to December, and he was concerned that guidance for the third quarter could disappoint Wall Street analysts as a result of the possible delay.

Mohan now sees September quarter revenue of $87.1 billion, well below consensus at $91. [...]<br>
