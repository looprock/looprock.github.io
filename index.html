            On iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, the Voice Memos app includes a recording feature that lets you record a second audio layer – like vocals, narration, or an extra instrument – over an existing memo, all without needing headphones. Keep reading to learn how it's done.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Let&rsquo;s get the AI to build D&amp;D adventures for us with a Model Context Protocol Prompt. I haven&rsquo;t found much value in MCP Prompts until now. What makes them excited is when you use them a &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; to chain together other tool calls. In this episode of my MCP programming series, I show you how to make two MCP Prompts. First, a simple one that boot-straps playing D&amp;D. Second, a more complex one that pulls together an adventure overview using multiple tools and &ldquo;reasoning.&rdquo; I think the result gets to a type of agentic AI.</p>

            <p>The AIs are good at being a Dungeon Master for Dungeons &amp; Dragons, but their memory is limited. How can you make sure they don&rsquo;t forget all that loot you just got, or ensure that cobbler back in the village remembers the type of boots you orders and paid for up front? I&rsquo;ll show you how to use Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create a DM Journal. This is done by writing an MCP Server tool that write journal entries and then an MCP Server Resource that allows you to read them. It&rsquo;s just files, but it&rsquo;s a good excuse to learn some agentic AI coding in Java, with the help of Spring AI.</p>
