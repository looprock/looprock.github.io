            <p>You can generate really big Dungeons &amp; Dragons battle maps with Midjourney. It takes some iteration and tinkering, but the maps are great. I like big battle maps so that characters, NPCs, and monsters have lots of room to move around and take tactical advantage of ranged spells and attacks. While the big images are grainy when you zoom in, if you save the series of original images that you zoomed out of, you can always zoom back in, so to speak.</p>
