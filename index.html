            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-03 11:20:05-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In the second iOS 18.4 beta that Apple released today, there are a selection of new emoji characters, including bags under eyes, fingerprint, leafless tree, root vegetable, harp, shovel, and splatter.
<br/>

<br/>
The emojis are part of the Unicode 16 Standard that was released in September 2024.
<br/>
<br/>
It often takes Apple several months to create artwork for new emoji characters that are approved, so it is no surprise that we're not seeing the September 2024 emoji until now.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple last added new emoji with the iOS 17.4 update that came out in March 2024, introducing lime, an edible brown mushroom, a phoenix, a broken chain, shaking head vertically (as in a "yes" nod), and shaking head horizontally (a "no" head shake).

Glass curtain wall buildings were cheaper to erect than their masonry predecessors, and they allowed developers to squeeze more rentable space from the same building footprint. Ornate, detailed exteriors were increasingly seen as something tenants didn’t particularly care about, making it harder to justify spending money on them. And once this style had taken hold, rational risk aversion encouraged developers and builders to keep using it.”<!-- category:link --></p><br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-03 13:25:52+01:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Hemingway saw in Cézanne a kindred spirit—a man who stripped nature down to its essentials and reassembled it into something honest and uncompromised. Here are a few reasons for his admiration:</p>
<ol>
<li>Structural Purity: Cézanne’s work revolves around reducing forms to their geometric fundamentals. His method of breaking objects down into simple shapes and planes resonated with Hemingway’s own drive for clarity and precision in language. Hemingway’s lean, unadorned prose sought a similar kind of structural integrity—a means to get at the truth beneath the surface.</li>
<li>Minimalism and Truth: Both Cézanne and Hemingway valued the power of minimalism. Cézanne’s deliberate brushstrokes and reduced color palette, which stripped away the nonessential, paralleled Hemingway’s sparse writing style. For Hemingway, art was about capturing the bare reality without extraneous flourish, a quality that Cézanne exemplified in his canvases.</li>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-03 13:24:45+01:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>At its core, “a huevo” is an enthusiastic “hell yeah!” or “damn right!” in Mexican slang. It comes from huevo (which literally means “egg” but is also slang for testicles), but the phrase itself is more about confidence, excitement, or inevitability.</p>
<h1 id="how-its-used">How It’s Used</h1>
<ul>
<li>Agreement or excitement → ”¿Vamos por tacos?” / ”¡A huevo!” (Hell yeah, let’s go!)</li>
<li>Confidence or certainty → “Ganamos el partido.” / “A huevo.” (Of course we won.)</li>
<li>Going all in on something → “Se aventó el proyecto de a huevo.” (He went all out on the project.)</li>
<li>Something being unavoidable → “Es a huevo.” (It’s mandatory.)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="is-it-like-balls-out-in-english">Is It Like “Balls Out” in English?</h1>
<p>Kind of! “A huevo” carries the same bold, all-in energy as saying someone went “balls out” or was “ballsy” in English. The difference? It’s mostly positive—it’s about confidence and enthusiasm, not risk or recklessness.</p>

            <p>“Greentext” refers to a style of writing popularized on <strong>4chan</strong> and other imageboards. It’s characterized by using the &gt; symbol at the start of each line, which turns the text green on 4chan’s interface. Originally, this syntax was meant for quoting previous posts, but it evolved into a distinctive storytelling format, often used for short, humorous, exaggerated, or absurd anecdotes.</p>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-03 10:06:00+01:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>The phrase “How do you like them apples?” (or “How you like them apples?”) likely originates from American slang in the early 20th century, though its exact origin is debated. It generally conveys a sense of triumph, challenge, or one-upmanship.</p>
<p>Possible Origins:</p>
<ol>
<li>World War I Artillery Slang (1910s) - British and American soldiers referred to certain types of grenades or artillery shells as “toffee apples” due to their round shape. When launching an attack, soldiers might have used a phrase like “How do you like them apples?” as a taunt to the enemy.</li>
<li>Early American Slang (1920s-1930s) - The phrase started appearing in American slang as a way to rub in a victory or deliver a rhetorical punch. It was likely a variation of similar expressions that emphasized irony or a reversal of fortune.</li>
<li>Popularization in Mid-20th Century - The phrase appeared in various pulp fiction, movies, and comics in the mid-20th century, often used by tough or streetwise characters.</li>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>“Greeble” refers to small, intricate details added to the surface of an object—often in visual design, 3D modeling, or special effects—to make it look more complex and visually interesting. The term is especially common in sci-fi and fantasy aesthetics, where greebles are used to give spaceships, buildings, or machinery a more detailed, lived-in appearance.</p>
<p>The concept was popularized by artists and model-makers working on Star Wars and other sci-fi films, where adding greebles to models helped create a sense of scale and realism. In digital design, greebling is a technique used in 3D modeling to add non-functional, ornamental geometry to an otherwise simple shape.</p>
<p>In short, greebles don’t serve a practical purpose but make things look more intricate and realistic.</p>
