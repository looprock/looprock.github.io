            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-13 04:44:26-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's long-rumored foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> may cost less to manufacture than previously expected thanks to major reductions in hinge component pricing, according to analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.

<br/>
In a <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/mnbyfW1xgQZ5ia">new report</a>, Kuo said that the hinge designed for Apple's foldable ‌iPhone‌ is expected to carry an average selling price (ASP) of approximately $70 to $80 when mass production begins, well below the market expectation of $100 to $120 or higher. Kuo attributed the cost decline not to cheaper materials, but to "assembly design optimization" and Foxconn's influence in production scaling.

It is unclear if the new AirPods Pro would be branded as AirPods Pro 4, or if they would be considered an updated version of AirPods Pro 3. Gurman did not take a position, opting to describe them as a "new version" of the "high-end in-ear buds."
