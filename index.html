            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple should unveil the iPhone 17 series in September, and there might be one bigger difference between the Pro and Pro Max models this year.

<br/>
As always, the Pro Max model will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/29/iphone-17-display-sizes/">larger than the Pro model</a>:<ul><li>iPhone 17 Pro: 6.3-inch display</li>
<br/>
<li>iPhone 17 Pro Max: 6.9-inch display</li></ul>Given the Pro Max is physically larger than the Pro, it has more internal space, allowing for a larger battery and longer battery life. Nothing new.

<br/>
It has been rumored that the Pro Max model will go one step further this year, though.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's next-generation M5 chip is expected to debut in five new products later this year, including the iPad Pro, Vision Pro, MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and iMac.

<br/>
M5 chips will reportedly be manufactured with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/23/m5-macs-launch-timing/">TSMC's latest third-generation 3nm process</a>, which should result in slight performance and power efficiency improvements over M4 chips fabricated with its second-generation 3nm process.

<br/>
Below, we outline what to expect from these upcoming devices.

If you have a compatible iPhone model with a LiDAR Scanner (see the list below), you can measure a person's height in Apple's built-in Measure app. This way, you can see how much your nieces and nephews have grown since you last saw them, or find out if your favorite uncle is as tall as he claims he is. This might sound silly (it totally is!), but many people have no idea that iPhones offer this neat little feature.

            Apple's position as the dominant force in the global true wireless stereo (TWS) earbud market is expected to continue through 2025, according to <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/tws-market-entering-maturity-poised-for-moderate-growth-through-2028/">Counterpoint Research</a>.

<br/>
The forecast outlines a 3% year-over-year increase in global TWS unit shipments for 2025, signaling a transition from rapid growth to a more mature phase for the category. While Apple is set to remain the leading brand by revenue and brand recognition, the report suggests that volume growth will be led by lower-priced models under $50 from other brands, driven by emerging markets and replacement demand.
