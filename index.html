            Employees at Apple retail stores are planning for overnight updates following the September 12 "Wonderlust" event, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1699151590039376107"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. Apple retail workers will be getting stores ready for the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models and other devices.

Gurman suggests that the overnight update could be because Apple is planning for near-immediate availability of new products after the event, but it could also be time that is used to put up new marketing materials. It is not unusual for Apple retail stores to receive overnight updates ahead of new product launches.

<p>Each year, Etsy hosts an event known as  “CodeMosaic” - an internal hackathon in which Etsy admin propose and build bold advances quickly in our technology across a number of different themes.  People across Etsy source ideas, organize into teams, and then have 2-3 days to build innovative proofs-of-concept that might deliver big wins for Etsy’s buyers and sellers, or improve internal engineering systems and workflows.</p>
<p>Besides being a ton of fun, CodeMosaic is a time for engineers to pilot novel ideas. Our team’s project this year was extremely ambitious - we wanted to build a system for stateful machine learning (ML) model training and online machine learning. While our ML pipelines are no stranger to streaming data, we currently don’t have any models that learn in an online context - that is, that can have their weights updated in near-real time.</p>

            <a href="https://www.ugreen.com">Ugreen</a> today added a new 300W multi-port GaN charger to its growing stock of charging accessories. The $269 brick features four USB-C ports and one USB-A port, and aims to provide enough power for desktop users requiring a single charging solution for multiple devices when away from home.

<br/>
Instead of supplying fixed power output to several devices, Ugreen's latest Nexode unit operates using variable power distribution. Its most powerful USB-C port utilizes the Power Delivery 3.1 protocol to offer up to 140W, which is enough to fast-charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro up to 50% battery in around 30 minutes using Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> 3 cable while charging four other devices at the same time.

Wilson put on enough clothes for business purposes and went to work under a high pressure of steam. He was awake all over. All sense of weariness had been swept away by the invigorating refreshment of the great and hopeful discovery which he had made. He made fine and accurate reproductions of a number of his “records,” and then enlarged them on a scale of ten to one with his pantograph. He did these pantograph enlargements on sheets of white cardboard, and made each individual line of the bewildering maze of whorls or curves or loops which constituted the “pattern,” of a “record” stand out bold and black by reinforcing it with ink. To the untrained eye the collection of delicate originals made by the human finger on the glass plates looked about alike; but [...]<br>

            Apple will acquire the major Swedish classical music record label BIS Records, intending to fold it into <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> Classical and Platoon.

<br/>
The discussion comes ahead of the publication of the first list of services to be regulated by the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The legislation introduces new rules that apply to tech giants that meet its "gatekeeper" criteria and force them to open up their various services and platforms to other companies and developers. For example, Apple could be forced to allow third-party companies and rival apps like Meta's WhatsApp to integrate directly with iMessage.

In recent correspondence with the European Commission, Apple argued that iMessage does not meet the number of users at which the DMA's rul [...]<br>
