            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's latest macOS Sequoia 15.2 update has introduced a critical bug that prevents the popular backup utility <a href="https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper</a> from creating bootable backups, according to the app's chief developer, Shirt Pocket's <a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/youre_a_mean_one/">Dave Nanian</a>.

<br/>
The issue stems from a "Resource Busy" error that occurs during the final stages of the backup process when attempting to copy system preboot or recovery files. While similar errors in the past could be resolved by keeping the system awake during backup, Ninian reports that this new bug appears to be more fundamental.

            As mentioned in our earlier blog post Fine-tuning AWS ASGs with Attribute Based Instance Selection, we recently embarked on an exciting journey to enhance our Kubernetes cluster’s node autoscaler infrastructure. In this blog post, we’ll delve into the rationale behind transitioning from our internally developed Clusterman autoscaler to AWS Karpenter. Join us as we explore the reasons for our switch, address the challenges with Clusterman, and embrace the opportunities with Karpenter. Clusterman and its challenges At Yelp, we used Clusterman to handle autoscaling of nodes in Kubernetes clusters. It is an open-source tool we initially designed for Mesos clusters and...<br>
