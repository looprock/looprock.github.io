            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WhatsApp is testing a new option that lets you control whether other chat members can export your chats with them or automatically save media you send them, according to <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-ios-25-10-10-70-whats-new/">WaBetaInfo</a>.

<br/>
Referred to as "advanced chat privacy," the new option has a toggle in a recent WhatsApp beta for iOS. By turning it on, you can prevent individual users or people in a group chat from exporting the entire chat history outside of WhatsApp. 
<br/>
<br/>
Enabling the option in a group chat causes everyone in the chat to be notified that advanced chat privacy has been enabled. WaBetaInfo says that turning on the toggle also turns off Meta AI, which lets users interact with a chat bot as part of the wider conversation.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Ahead of when new reciprocal tariffs go into effect on April 9, Apple customers are scrambling to buy devices before prices go up. Multiple Apple employees that spoke to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-07/apple-customers-dash-to-stores-to-buy-iphones-ahead-of-tariffs">Bloomberg</a></em> said their stores have been packed with customers "panic-buying" iPhones.

            To lessen the impact from the tariffs that U.S. President Donald Trump is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/02/apple-stock-trump-tariffs/">putting in place this month</a>, Apple will import more iPhones to the U.S. from India, reports <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-iphone-production-china-tariffs-6cc37f40">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>.

<br/>
The 26 percent tariff on goods imported from India will be less of a hit to Apple's bottom line than the 54 percent tariff on goods from China, the 46 percent tariff in Vietnam, or the 36 percent tariff in Thailand.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple does not plan to make major changes to its supply chain because the tariff situation is "too uncertain." Sourcing more U.S. iPhones from India will offset the cost of the tariffs in China, and Apple is viewing that as a short term solution wh [...]<br>

Apple shares opened at $177.24 today, as the company's stock price has continued to drop since U.S. President Donald Trump last week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/02/apple-stock-trump-tariffs/">announced steep new tariffs</a>.

            When most people make a serious mistake that harms someone else, they try to fix it. That&#8217;s basic human decency. But when the Trump administration admits to &#8220;mistakenly&#8221; trafficking someone with protected status to an El Salvador slave labor camp, their response is to mock the judge who ordered them to try to fix it.

            Apple has filed a legal appeal against a UK government order requiring the company to create a "back door" to its encrypted cloud storage systems, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) confirmed on Monday (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-appealing-against-uk-governments-back-door-order-tribunal-confirms-2025-04-07/">Reuters</a></em>). The confirmation means that the Home Office cannot keep all the details of its demand out of the public domain.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is likely to take a multi-pronged approach to manage the impact of impending tariffs on its products, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-04-06/will-apple-raise-iphone-prices-in-the-us-after-trump-tariffs-iphone-17-details"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. The company faces looming challenges, as new tariffs will affect not just China-based production but also the very countries Apple has diversified into.

<br/>
The upcoming tariffs range from 20% to 46% across Apple's global manufacturing hubs. India, where Apple increasingly builds iPhones and AirPods, will face a 26% tariff. Vietnam, which produces AirPods, iPads, Apple Watches and Macs, will be hit with a 46% levy. Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and even Ireland will face tariffs between a 20% and 37%.
