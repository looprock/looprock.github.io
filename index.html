            After a four-year absence, <em>Fortnite</em> is making its return to iPhones – but only for users in the European Union.

The return of <em>Fortnite</em> to iOS comes as a result of the EU's Digital Markets Act, which has forced Apple to allow third-party app marketplaces on its platform. Users in the EU can now download the Epic Games Store by <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/mobile/ios">visiting Epic's website</a> on their iPhones.

Apple regularly stops signing older version of iOS, typically within a week or two after a new version is released. When Apple stops signing an update, it can no longer be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side software verification check, so those who have updated to the latest version of iOS cannot downgrade.
