            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            One of the major factors that contributed to Apple's heavy focus on artificial intelligence in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> was an experience that software chief Craig Federighi had with GitHub Copilot, according to <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/apple-ai-siri-development-behind-9ea65ee8">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>.

In a report on Apple's AI ambitions, <em>WSJ</em> says that Federighi became an AI "convert" after testing the Copilot coding tool introduced by Microsoft-owned GitHub.

Customers were reportedly performing "eye gymnastics" looking around to different parts of the home screen in an attempt to find a show or movie to watch, so Netflix wanted to simplify the navigation experience.

When it is not possible to call 911, Android users will be able to send a text instead to get emergency help. The texting feature will provide precise location information to emergency responders, and it will let users send high-resolution photos and videos.

Apple's Environment for the Developer app features a black background with neon light animations in the colors of the WWDC artwork that Apple is using this year.
