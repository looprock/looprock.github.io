            <p>The AIs are good at being a Dungeon Master for Dungeons &amp; Dragons, but their memory is limited. How can you make sure they don&rsquo;t forget all that loot you just got, or ensure that cobbler back in the village remembers the type of boots you orders and paid for up front? I&rsquo;ll show you how to use Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create a DM Journal. This is done by writing an MCP Server tool that write journal entries and then an MCP Server Resource that allows you to read them. It&rsquo;s just files, but it&rsquo;s a good excuse to learn some agentic AI coding in Java, with the help of Spring AI.</p>

We take a closer look at the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/iphone-17-air-thin-as-buttons/">rumored design</a> of the ‌iPhone 17‌ "Air," which is expected to introduce a radically thinner design.

It has now emerged that even the buttons will need to be thinner than those used on the other models to simply fit on the device.

In 2020, Google added a function to its Chrome browser called Scroll to Text Fragment (STTF) that helps you achieve this. It allows URLs to link directly to any visible text on a page. You may have seen it work in Google Search, where clicking on a link in your returned results takes you to a highlighted passage of text further down the page.
<br/>
<br/>
Since then, Google has built the feature into the open source Chromium code, so most other popular Chromium browsers like Edge, Opera, and Vivaldi also have it these days. (Brave is an exception, citing &lt;a href="https://github.com/WICG/scroll-to-text-fragment/issues/76 [...]<br>

The ambitious timeline would require Apple to double its current iPhone production capacity in India. It marks a major acceleration of Apple's supply chain diversification strategy, which has been gradually expanding in recent years.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Meta <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/04/new-features-threads-web-experience/">today announced</a> that it is adding several new web features to the Threads social network, as well as officially relocating the website to a new domain. Threads is migrating from Threads.net to Threads.com, and Threads.com will be the new default domain name.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
When Threads launched in 2023, Meta did not own Threads.com, so it was located at Threads.net. Meta acquired Threads.com in September 2024, and since then, the Threads.com domain forwarded to Threads.net. Going forward, users who type Threads.net into a browser window will be forwarded to Threads.com.
<br/>
<br/>
To accompany the name change, Threads on the web is getting several interface updates to make browsing through posts on the social network easier.

            Netflix <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/introducing-a-new-way-to-experience-subtitles">today announced</a> that it is introducing a new subtitle option that only shows subtitles for spoken dialogue, aimed at those who don't need captions, but prefer to watch movies and TV shows with the subtitles turned on.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884791" height="1266" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/Netflix-Smaller-1.jpg" width="2250"/>
<br/>
According to Netflix, nearly half of all viewing hours on the streaming service in the U.S. happen with the subtitles or captions on, which is why it is debuting the new setting.
<br/>
<br/>
The new option will show subtitles for dialogue, but no audio cues such as [phone buzzing], [door slams], or [fireplace crackling], which are normally shown when closed captioning is turned on. Netflix says the option will be available on new titles that are coming to Netflix, starting with the final season of YOU that la [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the launch of iOS 18.4, Apple introduced a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> feature that summarizes multiple user reviews to provide an at-a-glance summary of what people think of an app or a game. In a new blog post on its <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/app-store-review">Machine Learning Research blog</a>, Apple provides some detail on how ‌App Store‌ review summaries work.

<br/>
Apple is using a multi-step large language model (LLM) system to generate the summaries, with the aim of creating overviews that are inclusive, balanced, and accurately reflect the user's voice.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When an iPad running iPadOS 19 is connected to a Magic Keyboard, a macOS-like menu bar will appear on the screen, <a href="https://majinbuofficial.com/ipados-19-and-ios-19-new-features/">according to the leaker Majin Bu</a>.

This change would further blur the lines between the iPad and the Mac. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman previously claimed that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/13/ipados-19-more-like-macos/">iPadOS 19 will be "more like macOS,"</a> with unspecified improvements to productivity, multitasking, and app window management, and the addition of a macOS-like menu bar would certainly align with that overall plan.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdR32VJQ6aE">shared a new ad</a> that highlights a key advantage that iPhone 16 models have over Android smartphones: the Ceramic Shield.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Apple says the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max displays are all protected by the latest-generation Ceramic Shield material, which is advertised as being "2x tougher than glass on any other smartphone."
<br/>
<br/>
In the new "Trust Issues" ad, a father hands his iPhone to a stranger and asks them to take a photo of his family at a carnival. Unfortunately, the stranger drops the iPhone, leading to a moment of suspense given the device might have been damaged. However, the display glass remains intact due to the Ceramic Shield.
<br/>
<br/>
"Relax, it's iPhone 16," the video description concludes.

Of course, your mileage may vary.

<br/>
Overall, the iPhone 17 Air sounds like a mixed bag. While the device is expected to have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/22/iphone-17-air-thinness-video/">impressively thin and light design</a>, rumors indicate it will have some compromises compared to iPhone 17 Pro models, including only a single rear camera, a single speaker, and an A19 chip instead of a more powerful A19 Pro chip.

In a <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/luXVWtplQ9Bokb">blog post</a> today, the well-known Apple supply chain analyst said that the iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will all be equipped with 12GB of RAM. He previously only expected the iPhone 17 Pro Max to have 12GB of RAM, so this is good news for customers who will be purchasing the other models.
<br/>
<br/>
Kuo said even the base-model iPhone 17 might be equipped with 12GB of RAM, but only if supply chain shortages can be overcome. He said that Apple will make a final decision on the amount of RAM it will offer in this device by May.

            <p>D&amp;D battle maps are one of the funnest parts of D&amp;D. Just <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/illuminatedcodex/search/battlemaps">looking at them is fun, finding them can be a tiny thrill, and making them is a delightful way to spend hours of time</a>. Oh, and using them. I’ve used Midjourney to make D&amp;D battle maps in the past, <a href="https://cote.io/2024/04/03/creating-huge-dd.html">especially to make really large battle maps</a>. That works great! ChatGPT was never that good at it, until now.</p>
<p>Recently, while playing through <em>Sons of Gruumsh</em>, I asked it to make a few maps, and ChatGPT did great. What was especially surprising was that I hadn’t really described what I wanted the map to look like, I just had the adventure text and some brief description of the areas.</p>
<p>First, it made this regional map:</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Playing D&amp;D with ChatGPT, Claude, or whatever is fun. But sometime you want more control over how it behaves and what it does. Check out this video for a quick tutorial on creating an oracle plugin for Claude. This &ldquo;plugin&rdquo; is a Model Context Protocol Server written in Java using Spring AI. Once you create the MCP Server, you can hook the oracle into Claude which will use it while you play as a simple yes/no oracle. This is a simple example that will show you how to get everything setup with Java and Spring AI to start making MCP Server tools. Keep an eye out for the rest in the series where I&rsquo;ll make much more complex and fun tools.</p>
