Were we to name Wells or Salisbury, Exeter, Hereford, or Gloucester, it might be presumed that something personal was intended; and as this tale will refer mainly to the cathedral dignitaries of the town in question, we are anxious that no personality may be suspected. Let us presume that Barchester is a quiet town in the West of England, more remarkable for the beauty of its cathedral and the antiquity of its monuments than for any commercial prosperity; that the west end of Barchester is the cathedral close, and that the aristocracy of Barchester are the bishop, dean, and canons, with their respective wives and daughters.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Obyte's Blackbytes offer unique privacy features in the world of cryptocurrencies, aiming to protect users' financial information and identities. Privacy coins like Blackbytes, Monero, and Zcash obscure transaction details, enhancing security and fungibility. Various techniques, such as CoinJoin, zk-SNARKs, Stealth Addresses, Ring Signatures, and Mimblewimble, are used by different privacy coins, each with its advantages and disadvantages. However, privacy coins face challenges when transitioning to centralized exchanges, compromising their privacy features due to regulatory compliance requirements. Blackbytes, in contrast, focuses on individual users and devices, dividing transaction data into public and private parts and allowing direct peer-to-peer exchanges. This design ensures confidentiality and makes it unsuitable for centralized exchanges. Combining Blackbytes with other privacy tools can enhance online privacy in the Obyte wallet.<br>

<br/>
SellCell asked over 1,000 iPhone users and over 1,000 Android users in the United States to gather its data. Of existing iPhone users surveyed, 63% said that Apple moving to a USB-C charging port would influence their decision to upgrade to an iPhone 15. 
<br/>
<br/>
Of those that would be motivated to buy because of USB-C, the majority of iPhone users (37%) said they would upgrade because they would be able to use a single charging cable for iPhones, Macs, and iPads. Overall, 66% of iPhone users said that they will upgrade to an iPhone 15.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Employees at Apple retail stores are planning for overnight updates following the September 12 "Wonderlust" event, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1699151590039376107"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. Apple retail workers will be getting stores ready for the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models and other devices.

<br/>
Gurman suggests that the overnight update could be because Apple is planning for near-immediate availability of new products after the event, but it could also be time that is used to put up new marketing materials. It is not unusual for Apple retail stores to receive overnight updates ahead of new product launches.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Each year, Etsy hosts an event known as  “CodeMosaic” - an internal hackathon in which Etsy admin propose and build bold advances quickly in our technology across a number of different themes.  People across Etsy source ideas, organize into teams, and then have 2-3 days to build innovative proofs-of-concept that might deliver big wins for Etsy’s buyers and sellers, or improve internal engineering systems and workflows.</p>
<p>Besides being a ton of fun, CodeMosaic is a time for engineers to pilot novel ideas. Our team’s project this year was extremely ambitious - we wanted to build a system for stateful machine learning (ML) model training and online machine learning. While our ML pipelines are no stranger to streaming data, we currently don’t have any models that learn in an online context - that is, that can have their weights updated in near-real time.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The latest version of the DoorDash app for iPhone contains code-level references to Live Activities, according to software researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613">@aaronp613</a>, suggesting that the app will soon widely support the feature. DoorDash already had a Live Activities toggle visible in the Settings app for a few months, but the feature does not appear to be functional yet.

businesses should start using Postgres.  It covers Postgres's structural benefits like vendor independence, code quality, and technology like NoSQL.  It also covers the challenges that
could be faced, like cost, time, and in-house expertise.  When I saw "Not controlled by a single vendor" in both the benefits and challenges sections, I knew he was on the right track!
