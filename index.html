Apple hasn't changed the ‌Mac mini‌ design in many years, and there are no rumors of a design update coming in 2024. Apple did make the ‌Mac mini‌ a little bit thicker and lighter when it was refreshed in 2023, and that same design will likely be used for the 2024 model.

            Navigating and editing text on your iPhone can sometimes feel cumbersome, especially when trying to precisely place the cursor. Fortunately, Apple has integrated a hidden feature in the virtual keyboard that can make this task much easier. Here's how to unlock and utilize this powerful tool to streamline your text editing.

The next time you are writing something a little more lengthy and need to go back and change something, simply long-press the space bar, and the on-screen keyboard will transform into a trackpad that you can use to control the cursor. This allows you to navigate quickly through your text, moving the cursor to any desired spot with ease.

But that's not all. If you tap the trackpad with another finger while in this mode, you can also select chunks of text. This dual-functionality makes [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-05-21 10:48:03-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Multiple celebrities have been spotted with a new version of the Beats Pill speaker, and today the device showed up in an FCC database, suggesting that we're getting closer to a potential launch.
<br/>

<br/>
FCC filings typically happen just weeks ahead of when a product launches, so we could see this new Beats Pill speaker sometime in June. Apple plans to launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-buds-announced/">Solo Buds earphones</a> in June, so the Pill could launch around the same timeframe.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple has clearly provided these Beats Pill speakers to a number of sports stars and celebrities to create hype for it, and the speaker has been seen with basketball star LeBron James, F1 driver Daniel Ricciardo, soccer star Lionel Messi, and Kim Kardashian.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today filed a pre-motion letter seeking to dismiss the antitrust case that the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) levied against Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/21/apple-sued-by-us-department-of-justice/">back in March</a>.

<br/>
In the pre-motion letter, Apple says that the government's lawsuit is flawed in multiple ways, and has not successfully alleged that Apple is a monopoly power in the relevant market, proven anticompetitive conduct, or demonstrated consumer harm. From Apple's filing:
<br/>
<blockquote>This case lies well beyond the outer limits of antitrust law. A Section 2 Sherman Act claim can move past the pleadings only if the complaint alleges (1) monopoly power in a relevant market; (2) anticompetitive conduct; and (3) anticompetitive effects. [...]
<br/>
<br/>
This complaint fails</blockquote> [...]<br>

Upon the discontinuation of the ninth-generation ‌iPad‌, Apple dropped the price of the 10th-generation ‌iPad‌ from $449 to $349. This means that the 10th-generation ‌iPad‌ is now $250 less than the $599 starting price of the ‌iPad Air‌ that Apple just released.
