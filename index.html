<p>Google Cloud suggests using a centralized proxy to mediate all communication between clients and remote MCP servers. This proxy enforces access control, audit logging, secret policies, and secure transport, helping reduce the attack surface by having one enforced point rather than many decentralized servers. In addition, Google emphasizes identifying particular risk vectors like unauthorized tool exposure, session hijacking, and weak authentication, and treating identity, transport, and policy enforcement as foundational rather than optional.</p>

            <p>As enterprises try to figure out the benefits of AI, they&rsquo;re relying on lots of private cloud:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over half (53%) of enterprises say deploying new workloads to private cloud is among their top priorities over the next three years. 84% already run both traditional and cloud-native apps in private environments. 69% are considering repatriating workloads from public to private cloud, and more than one-third have already done so.</p>

<p>My work at OpenAI reminds me every day about the magnitude of the socioeconomic change that is coming sooner than most people believe. Software that can think and learn will do more and more of the work that people now do. Even more power will shift from labor to capital. If public policy doesn’t adapt accordingly, most people will end up worse off than they are today.” Four years later, he’s betting his company on its ability to sell ads against AI slop and computer-generated pornography.</p>

            Back in 2012, an Apple retail employee named Sam Sung went viral because his name is similar to Samsung, one of Apple's main competitors.

            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> demand failed to meet Apple's expectations and the company's supply chain is scaling back shipments and production, reports <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1981051589000671742">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.

<div class="center-wrap"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>
<br/>
Suppliers are expected to reduce capacity by more than 80 percent between now and the first quarter of 2026, and some components with longer lead times will be discontinued by the end of 2025.
<br/>
<br/>
According to Kuo, the ‌iPhone Air‌'s poor performance suggests that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> and 17 Pro models already "cover the majority of high-end user demand," so there is little room for new market segments.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-22 09:10:10-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today confirmed it will not be allowing customers to trade in the original Vision Pro toward the purchase of the new model or any other device.

<br/>
"Apple Vision Pro is not eligible for trade-in," says Apple, in the fine print of a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/new-ipad-pro-14-inch-macbook-pro-and-apple-vision-pro-now-available/">press release</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Some customers who spent at least $3,499 on the original Vision Pro may be disappointed to learn that Apple is not willing to offer any credit for the device.
<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/apple-announces-vision-pro-with-m5-chip/">new Vision Pro</a>'s key changes include an M5 chip, 120Hz support, and the inclusion of a more comfortable Dual Knit Band in the box. However, the Dual Knit Band is also compatibl [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's "A20" chip designed for next year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models could be considerably more expensive, the <a href="https://www.chinatimes.com/newspapers/20250922000510-260110?chdtv"><em>China Times</em></a> reports.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The A20 chip is likely to be the first widely available 2-nanometer chip, debuting in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> lineup next year and forming the foundation of subsequent M6-series chips. The previous three generation A-series chips have all been based on TMSC's 3-nanometer node, with the upgrade to 2-nanometer promising further performance and efficiency improvements.
<br/>

TSMC has reportedly told customers, presumably including Apple, to expect pricing that is at least 50% higher than 3-nanometer processors. This [...]<br>

<br/>
The key change across all three devices is the M5 chip, for faster performance.
<br/>
<br/>
The updated 14-inch MacBook Pro base model also offers up to 2× faster SSD read and write speeds compared to the equivalent previous-generation model.
<br/>
<br/>
The twice-as-fast SSD speeds extend to the new 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro models, which also received Apple's custom N1 chip with Wi-Fi 7 support, Apple's custom C1X modem for cellular configurations, the ability to drive external displays at up to a 120Hz refresh [...]<br>
