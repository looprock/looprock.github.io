We have reached out to Apple for an update on the matter.

<p>The co-founder of website builder Wix is embracing generative AI, and he’s not too worried that it might destroy the business models of the web. </p> <p class="p--has-dropcap" id="xcxM99">Today, I’m talking with Avishai Abrahami, the CEO of Wix. You might know Wix as a website builder. It’s a competitor to WordPress and Squarespace. Tons of sites across the web run on Wix. But the web is changing rapidly, and Wix’s business today is less about web publishing and more about providing software to help business owners run their entire companies. It’s fascinating, and Avishai has built a fascinating structure inside of Wix to make all of that happen.  </p>

            Work on multiple next-generation Vision Pro headsets is ongoing, according to two new reports coming out of Asia.

<br/>
<em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20231127PD223.html">DigiTimes</a></em> claims that there are a total of four different second-generation Vision Pro headsets in development, including a direct successor to the first-generation model and a more affordable model. The nature of the other two second-generation models is unclear. 
<br/>
<br/>
The bill of materials (BOM) for the more affordable headset will reportedly be half that of the first-generation Vision Pro to enable a significantly reduced retail price. Samples of this device are apparently set to begin production in the second half of 2024, with launch following in the second half of 2025 at the earliest.

            For decades, the FCC has maintained an arguably pathetic definition of &#8220;broadband,&#8221; allowing the telecom industry to under-deliver substandard access. And despite some new rhetoric from the agency under Biden, that doesn&#8217;t appear to be changing anytime soon. Broadband was originally defined as any 200 kbps connection.

            Apple's 15-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> doesn't have a fan, and instead uses a passive heat spreader to conduct heat away from Apple's energy efficient <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip. Curious to know if performance could be further improved with an active cooling solution, <a href="https://www.froresystems.com">Frore Systems</a> installed its own novel solid-state active cooling system into the laptop and subjected it to several benchmarks, with some impressive results.

As a minor update, iOS 17.1.2 should be focused on bug fixes, but it's unclear exactly which issues might be addressed. Some users have continued to experience Wi-Fi issues on iOS 17.1.1, so perhaps iOS 17.1.2 will include the same <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/ios-17-2-beta-addresses-wifi-issues/">fix for Wi-Fi connectivity issues</a> that Apple already included in the iOS 17.2 beta.
