<br/>
Nvidia is expected to overtake Apple as the single largest source of revenue for TSMC. Analyst estimates suggest Nvidia will generate approximately $33 billion in revenue for TSMC during 2026, representing roughly 22% of the foundry's total revenue, compared with an estimated $27 billion, or about 18%, attributable to Apple. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang reportedly confirmed on a recent podcast that the transition has already occurred, saying that Nvidia is now TSMC's largest customer.

            Apple has stopped signing several iOS updates released earlier this week, preventing users from installing them even if they still appear in Software Update. The affected versions include iOS 12, iOS 15, iOS 16, and iOS 18.

<br/>
On Monday, Apple released iOS 18.7.4, iOS 16.7.13, iOS 15.8.6, and iOS 12.5.8 for older iPhone models, along with iPadOS 15.8.6, iPadOS 16.7.3, and iPadOS 18.7.4 for iPad models.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's rumored new variable aperture camera system for this year's iPhone 18 Pro models has reached the sampling stage, according to a new claim from a Chinese leaker.

Posting on Weibo today, the account known as "<a href="https://weibo.com/5888095979/QpcATha7l">Smart Pikachu</a>" said the feature had entered late-stage engineering samples, while a teleconverter is also "under evaluation" for the device. The iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max are expected to launch in September 2026.
<br/>
<br/>
A variable aperture on the iPhone 18 Pro could improve exposure control, particularly for video. By reducing light optically, it could help maintain natural motion blur and smoother exposure in bright conditions.

<p>AI is still stuck in “efficiency mode.” In many organizations, a technology organization leads AI efforts and is treated as a cost center. Those CIOs are incentivized to optimize for efficiency, not growth. The result is predictable: Tech-led AI strategies deliver productivity improvements, but not transformation. Equally concerning is that technology and AI executives tell us their business partners can’t articulate what they want from AI beyond saving money. That leadership gap bleeds over into the measurement of AI value.</p>

"This is a time for deescalation," added Cook.

This is something Apple has always advocated for."

<blockquote>
<p>Now, I’m sure that at least some of you are shaking your heads and thinking, I’m saying we have to all build our own PaaS. Haven’t we been there before with platforms as a service? But I am absolutely not suggesting that we walk up to Sisyphus, give a big high five and go, “Let’s grab that boulder and push it up the hill of our internal platform as a service.” It’s not about rebuilding what we can purchase that is available on the market. It’s about making sure we spend our time building the things that are bespoke and important for our organization. It’s so we can depend on platforms like these products and more to build on top of because an internal platform is bespoke to your business. It is always striving to fill the space between what you can buy from the market and what your teams demand to be effective. Said</p></blockquote> [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2026-01-27 00:00:00+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Kubernetes memory limits introduce a subtle but critical interaction with the Go runtime that can determine whether a service runs efficiently or fails under load. This article explores how Go manages memory under normal conditions and what changes when Kubernetes enforces hard memory constraints. Using controlled load testing, it shows why Go is generally excellent at self regulating memory, how OOM events emerge once limits are imposed, and how tools like GOMEMLIMIT can be used to align the runtime with container boundaries. Originally published in July 2024, the guidance remains highly relevant for teams running Go services in containerized environments where stability and throughput are tightly coupled to memory configuration.</p><br>
