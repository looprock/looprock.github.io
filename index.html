            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            OpenAI today introduced <a href="https://chatgpt.com/atlas">ChatGPT Atlas</a>, a dedicated AI browser that includes ChatGPT integration. OpenAI says that the browser was designed around the question "What if you could chat with your web browser?"

<br/>
There is a dedicated "Ask ChatGPT" sidebar, allowing users to ask the chatbot questions directly from the browser without having to go to the ChatGPT website or app. ChatGPT will be able to do things like provide page summaries, compare products, answer questions about content on a website, edit and check code, and more, because it can see what the user is looking at. Browser memory is included for personalization purposes, and Atlas will learn more about the user over time.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-21 07:30:01-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's newly introduced M5 chip takes Apple silicon to the next level, delivering meaningful gains across CPU, GPU, and AI workloads, but how does it compare to the M4?

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Samsung is holding a Galaxy Event tomorrow, where the company will unveil its long-awaited "Project Moohan" mixed reality headset that will compete with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>. Samsung says that it is "ushering in a new era" with its upcoming "AI-native devices."

<br/>
Samsung already showed off the Project Moohan AR/VR headset back in January, and it looks a lot like the Vision Pro. It has a display that resembles a set of ski goggles, just like the Vision Pro, and a soft, fabric seal that fits against the face. There's a single padded strap that has a knob at the back for adjusting fit. As with the Vision Pro, Samsung's headset uses an external battery that's meant to be carried in a pocket.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-20 11:37:31-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The fourth beta of iOS 26.1 includes an option to turn off the Lock Screen swipe that activates the camera, a feature that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users have been wanting for years.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1023906" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/lock-screen-swipe-disable-camera.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
In the Camera section of the Settings app, there's a Lock Screen Swipe to Open Camera setting, and turning it off disables the feature where you can swipe left to open the camera.
<br/>
<br/>
The ‌iPhone‌ has long allowed users to open the Camera app directly from the Lock Screen with a swipe, but it can be a setting that's easy to activate, and it provides a way for someone that gets ahold of an ‌iPhone‌ to use it to take unwanted photos. 
<br/>
<br/>
There was previously no way to turn off Lock Screen camera activation without disabling the camera app entirely.  [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-20 10:57:52-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the fourth betas of iOS 26.1, iPadOS 26.1, and macOS 26.1, Apple has introduced a new setting that's designed to allow users to customize the look of Liquid Glass.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1023903" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/ios-26-1-liquid-glass-opaque.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
The toggle lets users select from a clear look for Liquid Glass, or a tinted look. Clear is the current Liquid Glass design, which is more transparent and shows the background underneath buttons, bars, and menus, while tinted increases the opacity of Liquid Glass and adds more contrast.
<br/>
<br/>
The new setting can be found on iOS and iPadOS by going to Settings &gt; Display and Brightness, or System Settings &gt; Appearance on the Mac.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that the new toggle was added because during the beta testing period over the summer, user feedback suggested that some people would prefer to have a more opaque option for Liquid Glass. Th [...]<br>
