            Earlier this month, rumors suggested that Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/17/apple-may-not-offer-leather-cases-for-iphone-15/">eliminate leather cases</a> for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/28/apple-non-leather-iphone-15-cases/">subsequent information</a> pointed toward the possibility of a leather alternative with a woven fabric look.

<br/>
Leaker <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/duanrui/">DuanRui</a>, who has been sharing many of the rumors about the cases, today suggested that Apple plans to call its new leather alternative "FineWoven." If this is accurate, Apple would presumably sell silicone cases and the new "FineWoven" case.

I can't go a day (or two) without building a bot of some sort, and last week was no exception. I've been a fan of the <a href="https://developer.marvel.com">Marvel API</a> for nearly a decade now, and one of my favorite examples of it is my <a href="https://botsin.space/@randomcomicbook">random comic book cover</a> bot.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>\
Module Design Pattern is a way to encapsulate and organize code in a self-containing module that can expose certain functionalities while keeping the rest of the code private.</p>
<p>\
This helps prevent variable and function name clashes, improves code maintainability, and promotes the concept of separation of concerns.</p>
<p>\
Here's an example of how you can implement the Module Design Pattern in JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code>// Module using the Module Design Pattern
var Module = (function() {
  // Private variable
  var privateVariable = "I am a private variable";

  // Private function
  var privateFunction = function privateFunction() {
    console.log("This is a private function");
  }

  // Public function
  var publicFunction = function() {
      console.log("This is a public function");

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-08-30 02:51:59-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Google <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> users on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> can now lock their most sensitive images and videos in a special passcode-protected folder, thanks to a new feature rolling out to the iOS app.

<br/>
Previously only available on Android phones, the privacy-oriented Locked Folder feature allows users to save photos and videos in the app within a separate space that requires <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>, or a passcode to access.
<br/>
<br/>
Media saved in the folder remains hidden, meaning the sensitive photos don't show up as users scroll through their Google ‌Photos‌ or any other apps on their device.
