The $11.99 standard Premium Individual plan that Spotify offers includes ad-free playback and 15 hours of audiobook listening time per month from a catalog of more than 250,000 titles. Until now, Spotify did not let customers opt for a cheaper plan that did not include audiobook access, as it was automatically bundled in the lowest-tier plan.

But here’s the million-dollar question: Will the driver you are paired with, arrive at the estimated time? One of Lyft’s most simple, yet profound goals is to ensure we provide riders with the most accurate ETAs we can.</p><p>Before you even hit ‘request’ and summon a ride, there are complex algorithms that sift through historical and real-time data, leveraging machine learning alongside traffic and weather insights to predict the ETA (or pickup time) to display on the rider’s screen based on the destination they input. This got us thinking — how do we determine ETA estimates as accurately as possible, before a rider requests a ride?</p><p>Enter: <strong><em>Reliability</em></strong></p><h3>What does ‘<strong><em>reliable</em></strong></h3> [...]<br>
