As noted <a href="https://x.com/zollotech/status/1948171482674155850">by Aaron Zollo</a>, Apple on Wednesday re-labeled iOS 18.6 Beta 4 as simply iOS 18.6, meaning that it is the Release Candidate version. This change effectively confirms that the update will be released to the public next week.

Alongside the new label, Apple shared release notes for iOS 18.6, which is a minor update focused on bug fixes and security patches.
