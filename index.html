            In macOS, you can easily convert the format of images using a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/convert-images-macos-finder/">Quick Action</a> in Finder or you can achieve the same thing via the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/batch-convert-images-to-different-formats-using-macos-preview/">Preview app</a>, but if your daily workflow requires you to repeatedly convert images – for uploading to a blog, for example – then using a Folder Action can be a much faster way of getting the job done.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-19 02:10:28-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple fixed a bug in its Passwords app with December's iOS 18.2 update that had left users vulnerable to phishing attacks in the three months since the launch of iOS 18.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959050" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Generic-iOS-18-Passwords-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
According to an Apple security update spotted by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/18/apples-passwords-app-was-vulnerable-to-phishing-attacks-for-nearly-three-months-after-launch/">9to5Mac</a></em>, the Passwords app was sending unencrypted requests for the logos and icons associated with users' stored passwords.
<br/>
<br/>
Without protections of encryption, an attacker on the same Wi-Fi network could redirect a user's browser to a clone phishing site where login details could be stolen. The vulnerability was first discovered by developer Mysk's security researchers and reported in September.

            Along with a foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, Apple is working on a larger foldable device that's somewhere around 19 inches, but rumors have been split on whether it's an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> or a Mac. Some reports refer to the device as an ‌iPad‌, while some call it a Mac, and the split seems to come down to the operating system on the device.

<br/>
<h2>Is it a Mac?</h2>
<br/>
Some rumors have suggested that Apple is developing a foldable MacBook with an all-display design. The MacBook already has a foldable design, of course, but the difference here would be a single display without an included keyboard and trackpad.

<br/>
It is not unusual for Apple to stop signing older versions of iOS after releasing an update. Software that is not signed cannot be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side verification check, and it keeps ‌iPhone‌ users from installing outdated versions of iOS. ‌iPhone‌ models compatible with ‌iOS 18‌ are only eligible to download and run iOS 18.3.2 at this time.

The Screen Mirror Lightstrip connects to a computer using USB-C, and it is able to provide real-time dynamic mirroring that matches whatever is on your screen. It can match the output of a game or a movie, or it can sync to music, with the lights changing to match the rhythm of a song. With a Nanoleaf Premium subscription, there is an Orchestrator mode that provides access to different moods for music experience customization.

Nanoleaf designed the Screen Mirror Lightstrip for displays up to 32 inches in size, and it features a flexible zigzag design for simple and precise installation.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Have you noticed your iPhone videos keep playing on repeat in the Photos app? Since Apple's iOS 18.2 update, the stock Photos app automatically replays videos until you manually pause them – a feature that might be fine at first but can quickly become annoying, especially with longer clips.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-897381" height="470" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/icloud-photos.jpg" width="836"/>
<br/>
The auto-loop feature can be fun for short clips or when showing someone a quick video, but it forces you to take action to stop each video rather than letting it end naturally. It can be disruptive when you're browsing through multiple short clips in your library, and proves particularly annoying when viewing longer content where you likely don't want to see the same three-minute video play twice in a row.
<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, Apple provides a simple toggle to disable the behavior:

While choosing between ‌iPad‌ keyboards is now a clear-cut issue since there is only one available for each type of ‌iPad‌, it is now even more important to consider their slightly different features and designs when choosing an ‌iPad‌.
