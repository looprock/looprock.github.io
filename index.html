Apple does not often provide details or notes on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware, so it is unclear what's new. Note that this software is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/install-beta/#airpods-beta">limited to developers</a> at the current time.

When hosts create a new Spaces session, they will see a new option to "enable video," and can use their phone's front or back-facing cameras, in either landscape or portrait mode, for their video feed.

Currently, only hosts can turn on video, making them front and center of attention, while co-hosts and listeners are represented by icons surrounding the broadcast. Users have to join the Spaces session to view the video, just as they do to listen in.
