<br/>
Apple's Crossbody Strap reportedly features an unusual magnetic design; it likely has a "flexible metal core" that makes it magnetic along its entire length. At the ends, "rings polarized oppositely to the strap close the system." The design eliminates the need for conventional hooks or loops.
<br/>
<br/>
Samples of the Crossbody Strap are apparently made from a woven nylon material similar to the Apple Watch's Sport Loop bands. Apple may also introduce a silicone variant.

Apple told the <em><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgj9kjmvzzo">BBC</a></em> that proposed regulations from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) "are bad for users and bad for developers," and pointed to the European Union's Digital Markets Act, which it says has already caused feature delays for European users, as evidence of regulatory overreach.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-26 23:21:40-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iOS 26 (currently in beta), Apple has finally caught up with rival podcast apps like Overcast by adding more fine-grained playback speed controls to the Podcasts app.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1015704" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/iOS-26-Podcasts-Glass-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
While competitors have long offered precise speed adjustments, Apple's rigid presets often left you caught between speeds that felt either too slow or uncomfortably fast.
<br/>
<br/>
In previous versions of iOS, Apple's stock Podcasts app provided only four fixed playback speed options: 1.25x, 1.5x, 1.75, and 2x. That's changed in iOS 26, and users now have a lot more flexibility.
<br/>
<br/>
Not only has Apple increased the range of playback speeds from 0.5x to 3x, the updated setting also allows you to adjust the speed in 0.1x increments, thanks to a new, more granular adjustment interface.
