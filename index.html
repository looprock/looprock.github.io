            <b>Published:</b> 2023-11-10 05:47:30-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's new MacBook Pro models are powered by cutting-edge M3 Apple silicon, but the base configuration 14-inch model starting at $1,599 comes with just 8GB of working memory. In 2012, Apple launched the first MacBook Pro with Retina display, which also started with 8GB of RAM. Of course, Apple now uses integrated chips with unified memory architecture, which is why the company feels confident in arguing that 8GB on a Mac is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/8gb-ram-m3-macbook-pro-like-16-gb-pc/">comparable to 16GB on rival systems</a>. 
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
But not everyone is convinced. Apple's decision not to equip base models with at least 16GB of RAM in late 2023 has proved incongruous to many users, including Vadim Yuryev, co-host of the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmWPd7uEYEY">Max Tech</a>.
