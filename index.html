            Apple's online store is now down ahead of the company's annual September event, which begins at 10 a.m. Pacific Time today. The store is routinely taken offline ahead of major Apple hardware events, primarily as a marketing tactic for the company.

At today's event, Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 15 lineup, the Apple Watch Series 9, a second-generation Apple Watch Ultra, a USB-C charging case for the AirPods Pro, and an assortment of more eco-friendly iPhone cases and Apple Watch bands.

Four new iPhone 15 models are expected — all with a USB-C port and the Dynamic Island.

<br/>
Sourced by prototype device collector and leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/KosutamiSan/status/1701550243689705680?s=20">Kosutami</a>, the images allegedly show one of Apple's official bands, which are described as being lightweight, thin, and smooth. 
<br/>
<br/>
The bands are allegedly made from recycled nylon and polyester, with a twill weave pattern. Apple may have chosen these materials in an effort to appear eco-friendly, while simultaneously reducing their carbon footprint through the use of fabric-based leather substitutes.

            In the face of increasing data breaches and information theft, the concept of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) emerges as a promising solution. Harnessing the power of blockchain technology and zero-knowledge proofs, SSI aims to give individuals true ownership and control of their personal information without centralized interference. With this system, users can securely hold their identification documents like passports and driving licenses, increasing security and privacy. Despite its advantages, challenges to its widespread adoption persist, including issues of backward compatibility, steep blockchain learning curves, potential centralized storage of personal data, resistance from major corporations benefiting from data collection, and the complexities of developer environments. Various initiatives, like Dock Wallet and Gitcoin, offer solutions by creating platforms where users can easily manage their digital identities.

On average, this process takes about 15 minutes per day, but sometimes it can extend to 30 minutes. After performing some basic calculations, I realized that over the course of one year, it amounts to more than 12 workdays. That's a substantial amount of time—12 workdays per year—that I spend on repetitive tasks. Consequently, I have decided to address this issue and allocate this time to more productive tasks.<br>

The light strip comes in two sizes, one that fits TVs and monitors up to 65 inches and one that fits TVs up to 85 inches. Either one can be cut to the ideal size for the TV or computer monitor that it's being used with.
