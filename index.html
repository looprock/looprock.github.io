            The next-generation iPad Pro models will feature thinner bezels around the screen compared to previous models, according to a rumor shared today by a previously-accurate <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/O5VxfdQGB">leaker known as "Instant Digital"</a> on Chinese social media platform Weibo.

The leaker claimed that the next 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models will have 7.12mm and 7.08mm bezels, respectively, when excluding the metal edges of the devices.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple plans to maximize the display size on the upcoming iPhone 16 series by using a new ultra-thin bezel technology, claims a new report out of Korea.

<br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.sisajournal-e.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=401354">Sisa Journal</a></em>, Apple will use Border Reduction Structure (BRS) technology to minimize the bezel at the bottom of the display.

<br/>
Apple reportedly plans to apply the borderless display technology to all four iPhone 16 models, which are due to be released in the second half of this year.
