We have since learned that Apple's retail store plans in Florida go slightly beyond that. In early December, the company closed its store at The Galleria shopping mall in Fort Lauderdale, and opened a new store across the hall from it. We have confirmed that the new store is a temporary location, meaning that the original store is likely undergoing renovations and will eventually reopen with a modernized design.

We are two weeks into 2025, and Apple has yet to update or remove the 2024 timeframe for next-generation CarPlay advertised on its website. Apple also remains completely silent about whether or not it still plans to launch the system.

By preventing downgrading to older versions of iOS, Apple ensures that users keep their devices up to date with the newest security improvements.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Any typical search for a consumer Mac monitor inevitably leads to the Apple Studio Display – a seamless but prohibitively expensive option for most users at $1,599. That's where BenQ's MA270U steps in, offering Mac-native features at a much more palatable $459.99.

<br/>
Unlike typical PC monitors that often feel retrofitted for Mac compatibility, this is a 27-inch 4K display that arrives ready for MacBook use out of the box, complete with built-in color matching, keyboard integration, and even Focus mode support. But can a third-party monitor truly deliver Apple-like integration without the Apple price tag?

The scam exploits a security feature in iMessage that automatically disables links from unknown senders. Apple told the outlet that when users reply to these messages or add the sender to their contacts, the links become clickable – a behavior that scammers are now actively exploiting, according to the report.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is heading to court in London on Monday to defend against a class-action lawsuit seeking £1.5 billion ($1.9 billion) in damages over alleged anti-competitive App Store practices in the UK.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-804521" height="1009" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/app-store-blue-banner-uk-fixed.jpg" width="1794"/>
<br/>
Filed by King's College London academic Dr. Rachael Kent, the lawsuit claims Apple has violated UK and European competition laws by requiring iOS users to download apps exclusively through the App Store while charging developers a commission of up to 30% on purchases.
<br/>
<br/>
The legal action represents around 19.6 million UK iPhone and iPad users who may have been overcharged for apps and in-app purchases between October 2015 and November 2024. Under UK law, affected users are automatically included in the claim unless they opt out.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple may choose to refresh its iPad Air models in the spring with an M4 chip, skipping the M3 generation for the lineup entirely, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has suggested.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-967393" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ipad-air-gradient.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Apple released the M2 iPad Air in 11-inch and 13-inch screen sizes in May of last year, and the going assumption, backed by rumors, was that Apple would refresh the iPad Air this year with an M3 chip upgrade. 
<br/>
<br/>

            Apple's long-rumoured smart home hub or "command center" may not arrive in the spring as previously expected, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-978083" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Apple-AI-Command-Center-Concept-Mock-Gray-3.5.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
We've heard various rumors and reports about Apple developing an all-in-one smart home management hub. The device is said to feature a square-shaped 7-inch display, a FaceTime camera and speakers, and a new homeOS operating system with support for several Apple apps. Rumors suggest users will be able to mount it on a wall, but Apple is also designing a dock that will let it sit on a table or desk.
