As a result of this change, Apple says the titles of existing Voice Memos might only show the date and time of the recording on devices running older software versions.

Out of 25 companies backed by Softbank that went public, only four companies are above their IPO price. And the average loss in the 21 companies that are below IPO price is a whopping 45%. Knowing these numbers, I wouldn’t touch ARM IPO and instead wait to see the price settle down.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) combines digital IDs, CBDCs, vaccine passports, and carbon tracking data for surveillance and control. Sold as a means for inclusion and progress, DPI is seen as a technocratic governance system. The G20 endorses DPI, including programmable CBDCs, and digital IDs, promoting a comprehensive digital health ecosystem. India's digital identity architect, Nandan Nilekani, advocates DPI for various purposes, from tax collection to climate adaptation. The World Economic Forum and the UN emphasize that DPI relies on digital IDs, payments, and data exchange protocols. DPI's implementation aims to restrict consumption, purchases, and mobility, enabling social credit systems and 15-minute smart cities, subject to government mandates.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>A little while ago, Etsy introduced a new feature in its iOS app that could place Etsy sellers' artwork on a user's wall using Apple's Augmented Reality (AR) tools. It let them visualize how a piece would look in their space, and even gave them an idea of its size options. When we launched the feature as a beta, it was only available in "wall art"-related categories, and after the initial rollout we were eager to expand it to work with more categories. </p>
<p>What differentiates Etsy is the nature of our sellers’ unique items. Our sellers create offerings that can be personalized in numbers of ways, and they often hand-make orders based on demand. Taking the same approach we did with wall art and attempting to show 3D models of millions of Etsy items – many of which could be further customized – would be a huge undertaking. Nevertheless, with inspiration from <a href="https://careers.etsy.com/global/en/guiding-principles">Etsy's Guiding Principles</a>, we decided to dig deeper into the feature. What could</p> [...]<br>
