            With iOS 18.2 and iPadOS 18.2, Apple introduced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/">Genmoji</a>, the feature that lets you create a custom emoji character if there's not already an emoji that exists for what you want to depict.

<br/>
You can create ‌Genmoji‌ from the emoji keyboard in Messages, Notes, and more, and the characters work much like emoji. ‌Genmoji‌, like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/">Image Playground</a>, have significant restrictions put in place to prevent people from creating objectionable images, and these guardrails can make it hard to make what you're looking for.

‌Genmoji‌ are anything but open-ended, so I thought I'd highlight some of what you can and can't do with the custom emojis as of right now.

<br/>
<br/>
The decision to set up production in India was requested by Apple back in 2023, according to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/16/foxconn-wins-airpods-order-india/">previous report</a>. Foxconn officials apparently debated internally f [...]<br>

            Kurt Mackey is back for a deep dive into what it takes to build the developer cloud. Kurt joins Adam to discuss the alliance between companies and cloud, something Kurt refers to as the "Rebel Alliance," cloud complexity vs usability, Fly's future with Postgres and why they've waited, thoughts on Neon and Supabase (Kurt shares a hot take), and our CDN saga and plan to build a simple CDN on Fly called Pipely (still a Pipedream).<br>
