            <b>Published:</b> 2025-11-07 13:19:26-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            HTX Studio this week shared the results from a six-month battery test that compared how fast charging and slow charging can affect battery life over time.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Using six <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 12 models, the channel set up a system to drain the batteries from five percent and charge them to 100 percent over and over again. Three were fast charged, and three were slow charged.
<br/>
<br/>
Another set of iPhones underwent the same test, but with charging initiated at 30 percent and stopped at 80 percent, so the iPhones were always in that range.
<br/>
<br/>
Prior to the experiment, the capacity for each phone was tested, and after 500 cycles, the capacity was tested again. The results suggest there is minimal additional battery drain from fast charging, but keeping an ‌iPhone‌ between 30 and 80 percent charge could be minimally beneficial.
<br/>
<br/>
HTX Studio concluded that the best way to charge an ‌iPhone‌ is "however you  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With tvOS 26.2, Apple is changing the way that profiles work on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. It's now possible to create a profile without an Apple Account, which is particularly useful for guest profiles and profiles for children.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
In the ‌Apple TV‌ Settings app's profiles section, the "Add New Profile" option no longer requests that users sign in with an Apple device or manually with an Apple Account.
<br/>
<br/>
Alongside the Apple Account sign in, there is a "Create Profile" option that only requires a name, a profile rating, and a yes or no question about whether the new user is a child.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today provided public beta testers with the first release of an upcoming macOS Tahoe 26.2 update for testing purposes. The public beta comes a day after Apple provided the beta to developers.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006759" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/macOS-Tahoe-26-Thumb-2.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
After signing up for beta testing on Apple's beta site, public beta testers can download the updates using the Software Update section in the System Settings app.
<br/>
<br/>
The Reminders app includes an option to have an alarm go off when a reminder is due, the News app has some design updates, and Apple is adding new features to the Podcasts app.
<br/>
<br/>
The beta is limited to developers and public beta testers right now, but it won't be a long testing period. We'll likely see Apple release macOS Tahoe 26.2 right around mid-December given past launch timelines.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: </div> [...]<br>

            Apple's online store in the U.S. is suddenly offering a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-airtag/airtag/4-pack">pack of four AirTags</a> for just $29, which is the same price as a single AirTag.

<br/>
This is likely a pricing error, and it is unclear if orders will be fulfilled. Apple has not discounted the AirTag four-pack in any other countries that we checked.

Delivery estimates are already pushing into late November to early December, suggesting that many customers are attempting to take advantage of the deal.

            All flagship models in Apple's next-generation iPhone 18 lineup will be equipped with a 24-megapixel front facing camera, up from 18 megapixels on iPhone 17 models, according to the latest JP Morgan equity research report seen by <em>MacRumors</em>.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020062" height="898" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/iphone-17-center-stage-camera-shooting.jpg" width="1600"/>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's first foldable iPhone will feature an industry-first 24-megapixel under-screen camera built into the inner display, according to the latest JP Morgan equity research report seen by <em>MacRumors</em>.

<br/>
We've previously heard rumors that Apple will use an under-display camera for the book-style foldable's inner display, but this is the first reference to the camera's proposed megapixel count.
<br/>
<br/>
Under-display camera technology has been used on some Android phones, but they tend to have lower resolution sensors (4 or 8 megapixels, for example) because the image quality suffers due to being behind display layers.
<br/>
<br/>
The jump to a 24-megapixel camera (with six plastic lens elements, per the report) would therefore be a significant technological advance, potentially resulting in clearer, sharper  [...]<br>

<br/>
According to <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/QcIHO20a0">Digital Chat Station</a>, a Weibo account with more than three million followers, Apple is testing a single HIIA (hole-in-active-area) hole punch for the front-facing camera, which is currently located within the Dynamic Island.
<br/>
<br/>
HIAA is a display manufacturing technique developed by Samsung and other display makers that integrates front-facing cameras into OLED panels without taking up too much of the active screen. The technique involves precisely drilling a small hole within the active pixel area using laser micro-drilling, resulting in a single ultra-compact aperture opening.

<blockquote>
<p>[M]any organizations remain stuck in siloed approaches that pose problems due to competing demands for speed, efficiency and risk reduction. Enterprises that effectively integrate security into software development and deployment–both through platforms and tools, and via cross-team collaboration– are better positioned to drive velocity, quality and innovation while maintaining and even improving security."</p>
<p>Also, if you must Kubernetes, try to run just one, or as few as possible: ”given the array of tools and personas involved, organizations must contend with complexity, staffing and other hurdles in addition to cost, security and integration issues. Thus, it is critical to leverage a single platform that integrates the many open-source components of an effective Kubernetes deployment and supports the different personas (e.g., cloud admins, platform engineers and security teams) involved.”</p>

<p>more than 800 million weekly users already familiar with ChatGPT, adoption and ROI within businesses is realized more rapidly–pilots are shorter and rollouts face less friction. We’re seeing this with the growth of ChatGPT for Work–we now have more than 7 million total ChatGPT for Work seats (up 40% in just 2 months). ChatGPT Enterprise seats specifically have grown 9x year-over-year.</p>

<ol>
<li>Impressive momentum.</li>
<li>This is a good customer reference and boasting press release/blog.</li>
<li>The point of people’s ChatGPT familiarity because they use the consumer version is a great piece of differentiation. Good job pointing it out.</li>
<li>I am side-eye status in how OpenAI treats Twitter as an official, major channel for news. I removed the link above, but that 40% links to a Tweet. This feel ridiculous to me. Plus, it’s frustrating as an RSS-olds to miss out on that.</li>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>This would be great. I implicitly trust Google because my stuff is there. While I love using ChatGPT and Gemini, I have less trust in their security (they just don&rsquo;t have the track record yet) and even less on their morals and law-following (they obviously blatantly violated copyright for their models). // If things keep up in this trajectory, Gemini might be a real content, feature-wise for ChatGPT Anthropic is really good at app innovation though and will be hard to beat.</p>
