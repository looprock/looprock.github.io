            <b>Summary:</b><br>

<br/>
T9 dialing, or Text on 9 keys, is a predictive text technology that emerged in the late 90s to make it easier to type text messages on devices with limited input options, such as traditional mobile phones with numeric keypads.

<br/>
The best match appears first above the keypad, and tapping the person's name will call them. If there are several possible matches in your co [...]<br>

Kuo claims the most significant change in the new model will be the inclusion of Apple's M5 chip, a substantial upgrade from the M2 chip found in the current Vision Pro. The processor boost is expected to significantly improve device's computing power, with a particular emphasis on integrated Apple Intelligence features.

            Earlier this week, repair site iFixit <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/23/ifixit-iphone-16-teardown/">took apart the iPhone 16</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> Plus to demonstrate the new battery removal process that uses electricity for adhesive removal, and today, iFixit is back with a teardown of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max.

Apple's ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ models do not have the same simplified battery removal process as the ‌iPhone 16‌, with Apple instead using traditional stretch release adhesive for its pricier iPhones. It's still easier to get inside, though, because you can do so through the back of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> rather than the display, which can be easily damaged.

            Apple is working on an update for the low-cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, which hasn't been refreshed since 2022. As an entry-level product, the ‌iPad‌ doesn't get a lot of attention and it's not often the focus of rumors, but we've heard a little bit about what might be coming to the ‌iPad‌ 11.

Apple overhauled the look of the ‌iPad‌ in 2022, introducing a 10.9-inch all-display design and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> power button, so we're not expecting any further design changes at this point in time.

The move, which was announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/disney-plus-password-sharing-crackdown/">earlier this year</a> by Disney CEO Bob Iger, aims to boost revenue and subscriber growth for the streaming service.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18, Apple added several new accessibility features, and one feature in particular that is likely to have widespread appeal among car passengers is Vehicle Motion Cues, which aims to prevent motion sickness when looking at an iPhone or iPad.

<br/>
According to Apple, research shows that motion sickness is commonly caused by a sensory conflict between what a person sees and what they feel, which can prevent some users from comfortably using an ‌iPhone‌ or ‌iPad‌ while riding in a moving vehicle.

Vehicle Motion Cues are designed to avoid this sensory conflict with the use of visual elements on the display that indicate real-time changes in motion. Apple explains:
