            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has tested a redesigned version of Control Center with a customizable layout for iOS 18, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. However, we have not confirmed if this change has been finalized for the update.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The new Control Center would feature a drag-and-drop system that allows at least some of the controls to be reorganized directly on the interface, our sources said. Currently, only the smaller controls in the bottom half of Control Center for things like the flashlight and Low Power Mode can be rearranged or removed through the Settings app.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-06-04 15:22:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Popular Mac app Bartender appears to have been quietly sold approximately two months ago, with neither the prior owner nor the current owner providing customers or potential customers with information on the sale.
<br/>

<br/>
The transaction came to light after some Reddit users saw a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1d7zjv8/bartender_5_not_safe_anymore_warning_from/">warning from MacUpdater</a> letting them know that the company behind Bartender had been silently replaced. MacUpdater warned users that updates to the app from version 5.0.52 could be potentially unsafe due to the lack of transparency surrounding the situation.

Bartender's new owners replied to the Reddit thread and confirmed that Bartender had been acquired, but did not explain why customers had not been notified nor why there had been a certi [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-06-04 14:20:59-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple could soon launch its annual Back to School promotion for university students in the United States and Canada, based on ads that have been popping up on social networks.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-851334" height="1224" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/2022-back-to-school-apple-feature.jpg" width="2178"/>
<br/>
On Instagram, Apple is promoting Macs to college and university students. The ad in question depicts a Back to School image with the following text: "Buy Mac for university or college with education savings. Plus get a gift card for up to $200." The screenshot of the ad is from a Canadian user, and that price point suggests we will see the same $150 discount in the United States that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/06/apple-launches-2023-back-to-school-promotion/">provided last year</a>.

            Several current and former employees of OpenAI and Google DeepMind today <a href="https://righttowarn.ai">shared an open letter</a> warning of the dangers of advanced AI and the current lack of oversight of companies working on AI technology.

<br/>
The employees suggest there are a number of risks that we are facing from AI development, including further entrenchment of existing inequalities, manipulation and misinformation, and loss of control of autonomous AI systems, which the letter says could lead to human extinction.
<br/>
<br/>
AI companies have "strong financial incentives" to forge ahead with development and to avoid sharing information about their protective measures and risk levels. "We do not think they can all be relied upon to share it voluntarily," reads the letter, which says that it is up to current and former employe [...]<br>
