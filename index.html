In a new <a href="https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/2013628564223008849?s=20">post on X (Twitter)</a>, the now-retired Counterpoint Research VP said that Chinese leaker Instant Digital's latest explanation of how Apple will shrink the Dynamic Island is what he was alluding to in a report last year.

            Apple reclaimed the leading position in China's smartphone market in the fourth quarter of 2025 as strong demand for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> lineup offset a contracting market and growing supply-chain pressure from memory chip shortages.

The second-generation device will have "very minor changes," making it "basically a routine upgrade," the leaker said in comments machine-translated from Chinese.

            Over the last few months, rumors around the iPhone 18 Pro's front-panel design have been conflicted, with some supply-chain leaks pointing to under-display Face ID, reports suggesting a top-left hole-punch camera, and debate over whether the familiar Dynamic Island will shrink, shift, or disappear entirely.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>My findings after 3 years on AIs playing games is that they’re just generally bad at it. They’re just good enough to string you along, hoping they’ll get good.</p>
<p>Their lack of new ideas and inability to take action gives you a sort of “it’s just about to be good” feel that keeps you playing. Like that feeling that the next pull of the slot machine will be the jackpot.</p>
<p>Also, the memory required for ongoing RPG is vast, the AIs can’t take it.</p>
<p>AI’s can act like an advanced DM’s screen - a bunch of tools - but I’m starting to doubt that they’re any good at the role playing part of DM’ing.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            While the iPhone 18 Pro and Pro Max are still around eight months away, multiple sources have already commented on how much RAM the devices will have.

<br/>
In a <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/luXVWtplQ9Bokb">blog post</a> last year, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that he expected all of the new iPhone models released later this year to be equipped with 12GB of RAM. That would include the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and iPhone Fold, and it would match the 12GB of RAM included in the iPhone 17 Pro models.
<br/>
<br/>
In a research note last week, obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>, analyst Jeff Pu agreed that the iPhone 18 Pro models and iPhone Fold will have 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            As noted <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/01/18/heres-why-walmart-still-doesnt-support-apple-pay/">by <em>9to5Mac</em></a> over the weekend, Walmart still does not accept contactless payment options like Apple Pay at its more than 4,500 stores across the U.S., and there is no indication that will be changing any time soon.

<br/>
It is not just Apple Pay that is affected. Walmart also does not allow customers to use Google Pay or Samsung Pay, and you cannot tap a credit or debit card either. In other words, the NFC functionality on the payment terminals is turned off.

It is far from the first time that we have reported on this topic, but Walmart has still not changed course, despite endless customer complaints.

            While most sources in the Apple rumor scene agree that the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max will feature under-screen Face ID, there continues to be conflicting rumors about how that change might impact the Dynamic Island.

In a post on social media platform X today, the account <a href="https://x.com/VNchocoTaco/status/2013228811975053466">"ShrimpApplePro" claimed</a> that the Dynamic Island will be "shorter" on the iPhone 18 Pro models, as a result of some Face ID components moving under the screen.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Chrome for iOS will soon feature an option for iPhone users to import their Safari data into Google's mobile browser, avoiding the need to perform the transfer on desktop.

<br/>
Starting in Chrome 145, currently in beta, the new feature will guide users through the process of importing bookmarks, browsing history, and passwords from Safari, since Chrome cannot transfer the data directly because of Apple's privacy rules.
<br/>
<br/>
The process involves manually exporting Safari browsing data to a zip file downloaded to the user's iPhone, and then selecting the file in Chrome for import using the new option. 
<br/>
<br/>
Chrome's interface displays a breakdown of what will be imported, before doing so on the user's confirmation, then the browser offers to delete the zip file as a privacy measure.

            Apple's iPhone 18 Pro models will have a front camera cutout in the top-left corner of the screen alongside a new under-display Face ID system, which will see the Dynamic Island software feature relocated to the same corner.

Introduced on the iPhone 14 Pro, the Dynamic Island is the pill-shaped interactive area centered at the top of the screen that expands and contracts to display ongoing activities, while effectively hiding the front camera and Face ID sensor cutouts.

Prosser claims that Apple's new under-screen Face ID system will sit next to a top-left camera cutout, meaning the Dynamic Island no longer needs to be centered at the top. Instead,  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Ever searched for something specific, only to be met with results that are <em>close, but not quite</em>? On Etsy’s Search Relevance team, that frustration is exactly what we are tackling. Our goal is simple yet ambitious: to help buyers find exactly what they’re looking for, and to help sellers reach the people seeking their special products.</p>
<p>Search plays a central role in that mission. Historically, Etsy’s search models have relied heavily on engagement signals – such as clicks, add-to-carts, and purchases – as proxies for relevance. These signals are objective, but they can also be biased: popular listings get more clicks, even when they’re not the best match for a specific query.</p>
<p>To address this, we introduce semantic relevance as a complementary perspective to engagement, capturing how well a listing aligns with a buyer’s intent as expressed in their query. We developed a <strong>Semantic Relevance Evaluation and Enhancement Framework</strong>, powered by large language models (LLMs). It</p> [...]<br>
