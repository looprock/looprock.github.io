            <b>Published:</b> 2026-01-20 07:45:21+01:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>My findings after 3 years on AIs playing games is that they’re just generally bad at it. They’re just good enough to string you along, hoping they’ll get good.</p>
<p>Their lack of new ideas and inability to take action gives you a sort of “it’s just about to be good” feel that keeps you playing. Like that feeling that the next pull of the slot machine will be the jackpot.</p>
<p>Also, the memory required for ongoing RPG is vast, the AIs can’t take it.</p>
<p>AI’s can act like an advanced DM’s screen - a bunch of tools - but I’m starting to doubt that they’re any good at the role playing part of DM’ing.</p>
<p>I’ve been <a href="https://youtu.be/OV_ddU4BFvE?si=EK4V2e_8JMLH-AP3">optimistic for awhile</a>, and done a lot of work to get the AI good at playing D&amp;D. I need to think on all this more.</p>

<p>What the goblins can teach us about enterprise AI. // I’ve learned what agentic AI is by fighting goblins, talking with trolls, and buy custom made boots from gnomes. After a few years of playing solo D&amp;D with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc., playing the role of a DM, I started writing little plugins (Model Context Protocol servers) to give the ChatDM. This is much better than writing agentic AI for insurance claims apps! But, you can learn patterns and ways of using UI that are applicable to the more boring, well, practical applications of AI. D&amp;D is incredibly complex, arguably, more complex than most any “enterprise application.” If the robot can play D&amp;D, it can play ERP. The programming part of this isn’t important, instead, it’s interesting to see what’s possible, how AIs wo</p></blockquote> [...]<br>
