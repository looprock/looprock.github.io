            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is testing new camera miniaturization technology to reduce the size of the front-facing camera on next year's iPhone 18 Pro models, claims a Chinese leaker.

<br/>
According to <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/QcIHO20a0">Digital Chat Station</a>, a Weibo account with more than three million followers, Apple is testing a single HIIA (hole-in-active-area) hole punch for the front-facing camera, which is currently located within the Dynamic Island.
<br/>
<br/>
HIAA is a display manufacturing technique developed by Samsung and other display makers that integrates front-facing cameras into OLED panels without taking up too much of the active screen. The technique involves precisely drilling a small hole within the active pixel area using laser micro-drilling, resulting in a single ultra-compact aperture opening.

            <p>Enterprises are till trying to figure out DevSecOps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[M]any organizations remain stuck in siloed approaches that pose problems due to competing demands for speed, efficiency and risk reduction. Enterprises that effectively integrate security into software development and deployment–both through platforms and tools, and via cross-team collaboration– are better positioned to drive velocity, quality and innovation while maintaining and even improving security."</p>
<p>Also, if you must Kubernetes, try to run just one, or as few as possible: ”given the array of tools and personas involved, organizations must contend with complexity, staffing and other hurdles in addition to cost, security and integration issues. Thus, it is critical to leverage a single platform that integrates the many open-source components of an effective Kubernetes deployment and supports the different personas (e.g., cloud admins, platform engineers and security teams) involved.”</p>

The leaker and aggregator known as "yeux1122" outlined the latest news on Korean social media site Naver. TSMC has apparently started notifying major clients of impending price increases for advanced fabrication processes below 5-nanometers. This would include Apple's A16, A17, A18, A19, M3, M4, and M5 chips, as well as any future iterations. The price hikes are expected to be in the range of 8–10% and commence next year.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple in iOS 26.2 will disable automatic Wi-Fi network syncing between iPhone and Apple Watch in the European Union to comply with the bloc's regulations, suggests a new report.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1021796" height="923" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/apple-watch-se-3-always-on.jpg" width="1641"/>
<br/>
Normally, when an iPhone connects to a new Wi-Fi network, it automatically shares the network credentials with the paired Apple Watch. This allows the watch to connect to the same network independently – for example, when the iPhone isn't nearby – without the user needing to enter the password manually.
<br/>
<br/>
The feature's removal appears to be Apple's response to the European Commission's Digital Markets Act (DMA) interoperability requirements, which Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/19/apple-eu-interoperability-bad-for-products-users/">publicly criticized</a> on  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has changed how you dismiss iPhone alarms in iOS 26.1, and your morning muscle memory may have needed tweaking as a result. By default, the Clock app now requires a slide gesture to stop an alarm from the Lock Screen, replacing the previous tap-to-stop button that was redesigned in iOS 26. Snoozing still works with a simple tap, but turning off an alarm entirely demands the extra swipe motion.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1022258" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/ios-26-1-slide-to-stop.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
The change appears designed to prevent accidental dismissals when you're reaching for your phone in the morning. By requiring a more deliberate action, you're less likely to silence your alarm when you meant to hit snooze. If you don't like the change, you can revert the alarm interface back to the previous Stop button by following these steps.

<br/>
The Weibo-based account "<a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/QcA9idfbh">Digital Chat Station</a>" claims that Apple is evaluating a dual-lens setup for the next version of its ultra-thin iPhone, with a 48MP Fusion Ultra Wide camera joining the existing 48MP Fusion Main camera, similar to the base iPhone 17.

<br/>
However, the leaker says that the second-generation device will keep the distinctive horizontal camera plateau, suggesting the second lens will sit alongside the existing one, unlike the dual-lens vertical arrangement on the iPhone 17.
