            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-26 16:53:06-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple regularly refreshes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> models, and a new version that uses M5 series chips is in the works. Apple just finished refreshing most of the Mac lineup with M4 chips, and now it's time for the M5. Rumors suggest that we could see the first M5 ‌MacBook Pro‌ models this fall.

<br/>
<h2>Design</h2>
<br/>
There have been no rumors of a design update for the M5 ‌MacBook Pro‌ models that are coming this fall, so we are expecting the same look as the current models. There might be minor updates, but most of the changes will be internal.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple probably won't change the design of the ‌MacBook Pro‌ until it transitions to OLED display technology, and that's not rumored to happen until 2026 at the earliest.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Utah today passed the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> Accountability Act, a law that requires mobile app stores from Apple and Google to verify the age of users rather than having individual apps do age verification.

According to <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/26/utah-adopts-child-safety-law-requiring-apple-google-to-verify-user-ages.html">CNBC</a></em>, Utah Governor Spencer Cox signed the bill this afternoon. It is the first law related to mobile app store age verification that has passed in the U.S., and it will require Apple to verify user age when an Apple Account is created. If a child under the age of 18 opens an account, Apple will need to link the account to a parent's account, and parents will have to consent to app purchases.

            Apple is going all out with promotions for the popular Severance <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+ show today, and as of right now, you'll find a new "Lumon Terminal Pro" <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/lumon-terminal-pro/">listed on Apple's Mac site</a>.

<br/>
The Lumon Terminal Pro is designed to look similar to the machines that Severance employees like Mark S. and Helly R. use for macrodata refinement. The Terminal features a blue keyboard, a small display with wide bezels, and a trackball for navigation purposes.

Unfortunately, you can't actually buy a Lumon Terminal Pro, though it would undoubtedly sell well to Severance fans. Apple's page links to the company's actual Macs, and to a behind the scenes editing video &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/26/apple-b [...]<br>

Apple discontinued the iPhone 13 mini <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-iphone-13-mini/">in September 2023</a>, and it has not offered a mini model since then.

According to Severance editor Geoffrey Richman, the final episode of the series was one of the most difficult to edit.

There was around 83TB of footage to comb through.

            In the United States, the Apple Card offers a high-yield savings account option, allowing you to earn far more interest on your money compared to the average bank's basic savings account. However, the account's interest rate was lowered this week, with the annual percentage yield (APY) dropping from 3.9% to 3.75%.

<br/>
If you deposited $1,000 into the account, and maintained that balance for one year, you would earn $37.50 in interest based on the current APY.
