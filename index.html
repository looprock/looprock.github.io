<br/>
Ridiculous Fishing tasks players with casting a line as deep as possible then using tilt-based gestures to grab as many fish as possible. Players take on the role of a fisherman named Billy, who has some unorthodox ideas about fishing. Catching fish unlocks additional levels and new items to purchase.
<br/>
<br/>
The game has been rebuilt from the ground up for ‌Apple Arcade‌, and it features new 3D art, a new Pro Fishing Tour endgame mode, new guest fish, leaderboard support, and other new content.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Ember earlier this year introduced a new version of its electric Travel Mug, adding a key Apple feature - <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> support. You might be wondering, why does a mug need ‌Find My‌? I'm not sure I have a great explanation, but it's a nice-to-have add-on for a product that's positioned as a small luxury.

<br/>
The Ember Travel Mug 2 is $200, and the reason it's so expensive is because it's self-heating. It can keep a beverage at your desired temperature for three hours while on the go, or all day when on the included charging coaster. The temperature can be set from 120°F to 145°F, which is hot, but not likely to cause burns.
