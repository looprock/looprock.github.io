The app will look similar to Apple's longstanding Preview app on the Mac, he said:<blockquote>The software looks similar to the Mac version, and its launch screen is in the same style as apps like Pages and Keynote. It includes a big logo on the top portion of the screen advertising the Preview name and a gallery of document options below it.&lt;/b</blockquote> [...]<br>

            While the so-called "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>" is not expected to launch until September, there are already plenty of rumors about the ultra-thin device.

Overall, the iPhone 17 Air sounds like a mixed bag. While the device is expected to have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/22/iphone-17-air-thinness-video/">impressively thin and light design</a>, rumors indicate it will have some compromises compared to iPhone 17 Pro models, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-17-air-battery-case-report/">worse battery life</a>, only a single rear camera, only a single speaker, and an A19 chip instead of an A19 Pro chip.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's upcoming HomePod Software 26 update will support the original first-generation HomePod along with all succeeding HomePod models, according to a private account on X with a proven track record for upcoming software updates.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Apple released the original HomePod eight years ago, so it's good to see that Apple's latest software will support it. As for what the new software will bring to the table in terms of new features, it's not yet clear, but hopefully improvements to the Siri experience are forthcoming.
<br/>
<br/>
Rather than naming the next-generation version HomePod Software 19, Apple is likely to call it HomePod Software 26. All of the major software updates coming this year will be numbered "26," reflecting the September 2025 to September 2026 release cycle, so it'd be weird for the HomePod Software not  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's upcoming tvOS 26 software update will support all Apple TV models that are compatible with tvOS 18, according to a private account on X with a proven track record for upcoming software updates.
<br/>

<br/>
If this rumor is accurate, and we have high confidence that it is, then tvOS 26 will be compatible with the Apple TV HD – released in 2015(!) – and beyond:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>Apple TV HD (2015)</li>
<br/>
<li>Apple TV 4K (1st generation, 2017)</li>
<br/>
<li>Apple TV 4K (2nd generation, 2021)</li>
<br/>
<li>Apple TV 4K (3rd generation, 2022)</li>
<br/>
</ul>
<br/>
Rather than naming the next-generation version tvOS 19, Apple is going to call it tvOS 26, our source confirmed. All of the software updates coming this year will be numbered "26," reflecting the September 2025 to September 2026 release cycle.
