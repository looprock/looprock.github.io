            WhatsApp has rolled out a new feature on iPhone that lets you set reminder alerts for specific messages that you want to come back to later.

<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786421" height="1266" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Whatsapp-Feature.jpg" width="2250"/>
<br/>
Available in version 25.25.74 of WhatsApp, the feature allows you to long press on any message in a conversation thread and select a new "Remind me" option in the popup menu. You can then choose between 2 hours, 8 hours, and 24 hours, or set a custom duration after which you will be alerted about it.
<br/>
<br/>
The new feature is useful for keeping track of important details that might otherwise get lost in busy chats. It's also a simple way to make sure you don't forget to reply to a message at a later time. Here's how to set your first message reminder in WhatsApp:

            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> includes a new Home app feature called Adaptive Temperature, which is designed to adjust the thermostat automatically when you leave the house or arrive back home.

Adaptive Temperature can be turned on by opening up the Home app, selecting a thermostat, opening up the settings, and then tapping on Adaptive Temperature.

Amp is one of the many, and one of Adam's favorite agentic coding tools to use. What makes it different is how they've engineered to it to maximize what’s possible with today’s frontier models. Autonomous reasoning, access to the oracle, comprehensive code editing, and complex task execution. That's nearly verbatim from their homepage, but it's also exactly what Adam has experienced. They talk through all things agents, how Adam might have been holding Amp wrong, and they even talked through Adam's idea called "Agent Flow".

<br/>
Starting with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/15/apple-releases-watchos-26/">watchOS 26</a>, Adaptive Power is enabled by default on all compatible Apple Watch models set up via <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-for-your-kids/">Apple Watch For Your Kids</a>, formerly known as Family Setup.

            The website ChargerLAB today <a href="https://www.chargerlab.com/teardown-of-apple-40w-dynamic-power-adapter-with-60w-max-a3365/">published a teardown</a> of Apple's new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/iphone-17-models-faster-usb-c-charging/">40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max</a>, which has a key advantage over one of its other chargers.

<br/>
Specifically, the teardown shows the new 40W to 60W charger is roughly the same size as Apple's 20W charger, despite its higher wattage for faster charging speeds. In other words, you are getting more power from a smaller charger, although the 40W to 60W model costs $39 in the U.S., while the 20W option costs $19.

            Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1968249865940709538">reiterated</a> that a more affordable MacBook powered by an iPhone processor is slated to enter mass production in the fourth quarter of 2025, which points towards a late 2025 or early 2026 launch.

<br/>
Below, we recap the rumors about the lower-priced MacBook so far.
<br/>
<br/>
Kuo was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-to-launch-low-cost-macbook/">first to reveal</a> that Apple is allegedly planning a more affordable MacBook. In late June, he said the laptop would have around a 13-inch display, and an A18 Pro chip. Kuo said potential color options include silver, blue, pink, and yellow, so the laptop could come in bright colors, like 2021-and-newer models of the 24-inch iMac.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>The new Use Model shortcut in Apple Shortcuts opens up a lot of possibilities. For example, I like to summarize a lot of pages. Sometimes, ChatGPT can’t get the text for those pages, or I don’t trust the text it retrieves. There’s a shortcut that will retrieve the cleaned up text of a page (as markdown). So, you can get that markdown, and with the new Use Model shortcut, you can summarize it and then send the markdown summary to Drafts. You could open the text up in another app to view, whatever you like, but as you can imagine, I like to catalog this stuff. Also, it can generate a little link to include for my newsletters link list.</p>
<p>You put this in your Sharesheet, and now when you’re reading the World Wide Web, you can get summaries real quick-like.</p>
