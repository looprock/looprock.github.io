However, as the platform has grown, so has its content.

            Apple is making major changes to its U.S. iOS <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> policies, and developers are now able to direct customers to a non-App Store purchasing option for digital goods.

<br/>
As a recap, Apple first allowed media to use the Vision Pro following its debut at the Worldwide Developers Conference, but it was still under development at the time and features were limited. Now the headset is nearing release, so testers are able to experience the Vision Pro as consumers will.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-01-16 09:33:52-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today received FCC approval for the upcoming Vision Pro headset, just days ahead of when pre-orders are set to go live for the device. FCC approval comes a little over two weeks before when the Vision Pro will be in the hands of consumers.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913199" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Vision-Pro-Person.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
It is not unusual for new Apple devices to lack FCC approval until close to their launch date as it can take quite a bit of time for Apple to get products cleared. Apple devices undergo rigorous FCC testing in the United States prior to being able to be sold to the public.
<br/>
<br/>
For the last several months, Apple has been required to provide a warning message letting consumers know that the Vision Pro did not yet have FCC approval, but the wording will now be able to be removed from the website, advertising, and other places where it is printed.

We've been on a journey to strengthen our platform against abuse by continuously improving our account restriction systems. This helps us ensure that our policies are followed and that our community can keep growing. In a previous blog post, we talked about how we built our anti-abuse platform using CASAL. This powerful system is our first line of defense against bad actors and adversarial attacks. In this blog post, we'll go deeper into how we manage account restrictions. [&#8230;]<br>
