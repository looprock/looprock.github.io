The Birdfy Feeder 2 Duo is an upgrade to the current Birdfy feeder options, offering a three-lens camera setup that can capture visiting birds from multiple angles, rather than just a single angle. The Birdfy camera connects to Wi-Fi and images that are captured are sent to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> app for viewing anywhere. The app is able to identify and catalog different bird species, providing real-time notifications when there are visits.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is once again under scrutiny after its AI-powered notification system generated false news summaries on Friday, including an erroneous claim about a darts player winning a championship and a fabricated story about tennis star Rafael Nadal.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-984229" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/bbc-news-apple-intelligence-summaries-clean-1.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
<em><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx27zwp7jpxo">BBC News</a></em> reported that Apple Intelligence incorrectly notified users that Luke Littler had won the PDC World Championship before the final match had even taken place. In a separate incident on the same day, the system falsely claimed that Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, misinterpreting a story about a Brazilian tennis player.

These latest mishaps follow previous concerns raised by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), which called for Apple to remove the AI summary feature las [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple supplier LG Display is adjusting its main OLED production line over concerns about lower-than-expected OLED iPad Pro demand, with the company now planning to repurpose the facility to manufacture iPhone displays, according to <em><a href="https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=5095">The Elec</a></em>.

<br/>
The production line currently manufactures OLED panels for tablets and PCs, but has been experiencing reduced operation rates due to sluggish demand for Apple's OLED iPad Pro models. As a result, LG Display plans to adapt it for iPhone OLED panel production.

            The design of this year's next-generation iPhone 17 will allegedly feature a smoother transition between the edges of the device and the back cover, owing to Apple's use of a new glass-and-metal splicing material process. That's according to the Weibo-based leaker Fixed Focus Digital.
