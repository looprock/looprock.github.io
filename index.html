            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Streaming service Disney+ is set to gain support for HDR10+ in the near future, according to an announcement made at CES by HDR10+ Technologies (via <em><a href="https://www.mediaplaynews.com/disney-latest-big-streamer-to-deploy-hdr10/">MediaPlayNews</a></em>). HDR10+ offers improved brightness and contrast compared to HDR10, and unlike Dolby Vision, there are no licensing fees.

<br/>
Disney+ already supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision, but HDR10+ titles will be coming to the service in 2025. Dolby Vision and HDR10+ are similar, but some TV sets don't support Dolby Vision due to the licensing fees. Samsung TVs, for example, don't offer Dolby Vision content, so Samsung TV owners can look forward to better quality when streaming HDR10+ Disney+ content.
