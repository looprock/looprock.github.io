In addition to answering questions about Apple devices and services and providing device-specific help, Apple says the Support Assistant is able to help run diagnostics to show details about a device's health and performance.

<br/>
The Apple Support app now has a more informative interface for the Support Assistant, and the tab for accessing the feature has an updated "Ask" label with a new icon instead of a "Chat" label. Apple is no longer calling the Support Assistant an "Early Preview," suggesting it is now available in a more official capacity.

In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-01/apple-s-record-quarter-and-ai-changes-macbook-pro-update-clamshell-iphone-fold"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> on Sunday, Gurman noted that inventory of the current Studio Display is running low on Apple's online store and at its retail stores, although this has generally been the case for a while now. Extended shipping estimates on Apple's online store can sometimes hint at an upcoming product refresh.

Some components for the device are said to still be in development, since Apple has been changing the design of some parts to reduce manufacturing costs. China's BOE is also hoping to supply Apple with OLED displays for the ‌MacBook Pro‌,  [...]<br>

            <blockquote>
<p>AI is still stuck in “efficiency mode.” In many organizations, a technology organization leads AI efforts and is treated as a cost center. Those CIOs are incentivized to optimize for efficiency, not growth. The result is predictable: Tech-led AI strategies deliver productivity improvements, but not transformation. Equally concerning is that technology and AI executives tell us their business partners can’t articulate what they want from AI beyond saving money. That leadership gap bleeds over into the measurement of AI value. While most agree that AI boosts productivity, only 13% report positive EBITDA impact, and fewer than a third link AI contributions to P&amp;L. Without financial accountability, AI becomes an endless pilot treadmill — producing activity without outcomes. To shift AI from incremental savings to strategic advantage, business leaders must step in, define value in P&amp;L terms, and own the linkage between AI-driven productivity and financial performance.
