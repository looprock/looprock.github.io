<br/>
The report links pressure from major record labels on both Spotify and Apple Music to raise subscription prices. They argue prices have lagged inflation, while subscriptions remain cheap compared to video services such as Netflix.

<br/>
Wall Street analysts say the price increase is critical to Spotify's stock, as the company pushes to show profitability. JPMorgan analysts have projected a $1-a-month price rise would boost Spotify's annual revenue by $500 million.

            Huawei's just-announced <a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/cn/phones/">Mate 80 lineup</a> is attracting attention in China today thanks to a display spec that easily sees off the competition in the premium smartphone segment.

<br/>
The company claims the OLED panels in its latest phones can reach up to 8,000 nits of peak brightness – a figure that, if independently verified, would make the Mate 80 series the brightest smartphones on the market.
<br/>
<br/>
Huawei says all four models – the Mate 80, Mate 80 Pro, Mate 80 Pro Max, and Mate 80 RS – achieve unmatched peak output, but the Pro Max uses a dual-layer OLED design to push 8,000 nits brightness, with superior efficiency and better thermal handling.

You can tell ChatGPT what you're looking for, and shopping research will build a guide to help you make decisions on what to purchase. OpenAI says that it will ask smart clarifying questions, research deeply across the internet, review quality sources, and use context from prior conversations to build a personalized buyer's guide that's up-to-date.

<br/>
It is built to perform particularly well in detail-heavy categories like electronics, beauty, home and garden, kitchen and appliances, and sports and outdoor. The research feature includes comparisons, constraints, tradeoffs, and mo [...]<br>
