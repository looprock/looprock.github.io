            Roughly a month after the release of the latest flagship iPhone models, it's looking the new iPhone Air isn't selling as well as Apple had hoped for, and that's leading to significant production cuts as Apple seeks to balance supply to meet demand.

Foxconn will apparently raise capacity at its Kongara Kalan plant from more than 100,000 units per month to 200,000 units per month by overhauling five existing assembly lines and installing additional equipment that is being transferred from facilities in Vietnam.

            <p>You can ask Claude to make you quick D&amp;D maps. This is useful if you’re solo roleplaying with it. As you create encounters together, having a map is good for tracking complicated situations and getting spatial awareness. The only thing is you’re making very crude vector maps (SVGs), not the more realistic ones that ChatGPT will make. It feels like it takes just as long to make the initial map, but so far they’re less cheesy and more useful - utilitarian. Also, the first map is usually fine for using. The result is you don’t slow down play by spending a lot of time making and refining a map.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Repair site iFixit today did one of its <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/114046/m5-macbook-pro-teardown">device teardowns on Apple's new M5 MacBook Pro model</a>, which Apple released on Wednesday.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Unsurprisingly, there are few changes to the device because the only new features are a new M5 chip and a faster SSD, but iFixit did find some subtle tweaks related to repairability.
<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a>'s casing is still secured with P5 screws, and battery replacement is more difficult than it needs to be because Apple only sells the battery as part of the main chassis that also includes the keyboard. Getting to the fan, ports, and other components inside the ‌MacBook Pro‌ requires removing the logic board, and iFixit says that essentially every component in the ‌MacBook Pro‌ has to come out to perform a battery replacement following Apple's official repair steps.
