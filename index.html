            Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/">announced</a> that on Monday, September 9 it will hold its annual fall event, which means we are just days away from the launch of the iPhone 16. Like the iPhone 15 series, this year's lineup is expected to stick with four models – iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max – although there are plenty of design differences and new features to take into account.

<br/>
According to a reliable source familiar with the matter, Apple will release new Mac models in November 2024. While new Macs are usually released toward the end of the year, this is the first time a launch month has been singled out for the upcoming M4 Macs.
<br/>
<br/>
This does not discount the possibility of Apple holding an event in October to announce the new machines. Last year, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-october-mac-event-2023/">announced</a> its "Scary Fast" event on Tuesday, October 23.

It may also make some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/30/apple-september-2024-event-new-products-expected/">additional new products available</a>, but there are a handful of rumored upcoming devices that we don't expect to make an appearance this month.

            It's a day earlier than rumors had suggested, but Apple's big iPhone 16 event now has an official date: Monday, September 9. The "It's Glowtime" tagline and glowing Apple logo theme are clear nods to the revamped Siri and new Apple Intelligence features that will undoubtedly be a major point of emphasis for the upcoming devices.

Much of the news this week focused on what announcements we will and won't see at Apple's upcoming event, with the usual focus on iPhone and Apple Watch perhaps being supplemented by a few other hardware announcements but a number of other updates like Macs not coming until later. This week also saw fresh rounds of operating system beta releases, including some new Apple Intelligence features for those on the iOS 18.1 beta, so read on below for all the details!
