            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-28 06:47:57-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's market capitalization briefly surpassed $4 trillion just after opening today, making it the third public company to reach that figure. Nvidia <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/nvidia-4-trillion-market-value/">reached $4 trillion</a> back in July and is creeping closer to $5 trillion, while Microsoft also hit $4 trillion that same month before dropping down to a $3.9 trillion valuation, but it too has passed $4 trillion again this morning.

<br/>
Market capitalization is based on the total value of all outstanding Apple shares. We won't have an updated share count until Apple provides its earnings for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2025, so it is worth noting that the current market cap is not quite accurate. Apple's next earnings report will be shared on Thursday, October 30.

Users should see a "switch to video" prompt that appears when a song being listened to also has an associated music video. Video versions of podcasts work similarly, with the added option to change playback speed.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is preparing to bring support for its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118271">digital car key feature</a> to Jetour vehicles, according to evidence uncovered on Apple's backend by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris.

<br/>
Introduced in 2022, Car Keys allows an iPhone or Apple Watch to unlock a vehicle through the Wallet app. A digital version of a car key is stored in Wallet, and unlocking can be done by holding an Apple Watch or ‌iPhone‌ near a compatible vehicle's NFC reader.
<br/>
<br/>
A tap on the door handle is enough to initiate an unlock, and while Face ID authentication is a security option, Apple offers an Express Mode that eliminates the need to authenticate for a faster unlocking process.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is working to simplify the Camera Control button's design on the iPhone 18 in order to reduce costs, claims an established Chinese leaker.
<br/>

<br/>
The current Camera Control button on iPhone 17 models uses both capacitive and pressure sensors beneath a sapphire crystal surface. The capacitive layer detects touch gestures, while the force sensor recognizes different pressure levels for taps, presses, and swipes.
<br/>
<br/>
However, according to the Weibo-based account <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/QbbXB3KcV">Instant Digital</a>, Apple will remove the capacitive sensing layer and retain only pressure sensing recognition in the second iteration to achieve all Camera Control functions on the iPhone 18.

The single-sensor approach is similar to designs found in devices like the OPPO X8 Ultra and viv [...]<br>

            Apple's services business is expected to hit $100 billion in annual revenue for the first time this year, reports the <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3687fab7-3aea-4f81-9616-ed3d1f7be5b8">Financial Times</a></em>.

<br/>
Apple's services unit is expected to deliver annual revenues of $108.6 billion in the year to last month, which is up around 13 percent from the previous year. That's according to analysts' estimates at Visible Alpha.
<br/>
<br/>
If the estimates prove accurate when Apple reports its Q4 fiscal results this week, Apple's services division will be larger than the entire annual sales of Disney or Tesla this year. According to JPMorgan, services could make up a quarter of Apple's revenue but as much as 50 percent of its profit.

<p>The industry, especially the software side of tech, is driven by emotion and a sense of what is fashionable. There is genuinely more grounded engineering – materials, machinery, process, supply chains, etc. – taking place in the fashion industry than there ever has been in the software industry.”</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>

In its existing form, WhatsApp lets you manage storage globally by going to Settings ➝ Storage and Data ➝ Manage Storage, where files and media can be browsed from every conversation. 
<br/>
<br/>
There's also a "Media, Links, and Docs" option within each chat's info page where you can look at all of the shared files in a conversation, but it doesn't tell you how much space each file takes up.

To improve the situation, a new "Manage Storage" option has been added directly to the chat info page in the latest WhatsApp beta. As spotted by  [...]<br>

<p>Comparing China now to the US in the past isn&rsquo;t just a convenient rhetorical trick, it&rsquo;s arguably causal. While the full, more nuanced story deserves its own piece, the decline of the US&rsquo;s Rust Belt is definitely directly linked to the rise of China. A fate sealed by political decisions, primarily in the US, to go full &lsquo;free trade,&rsquo; which has meant factories leaving Ohio for Henan Province, where people work for less and companies can pollute more. Or as Wall Street called it, &ldquo;changes in policy, starting in the early 80s, but blossoming in the 90s, have allowed US companies to benefit from global labor and regulatory arbitrage, which has increased both their profits, size, and subsequent influence on labor, industrial, and regulatory policy.&rdquo;</p>
