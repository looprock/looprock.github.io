            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            While the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max are not expected to launch for another seven months or so, there are already plenty of rumors about the devices.

<br/>
It was initially reported that iPhone 18 Pro models would have fully under-screen Face ID, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-18-pro-under-screen-face-id-rumor/">only a front camera visible in the top-left corner of the screen</a>. However, the latest rumors indicate that the devices will have only partially under-screen Face ID, which will result in a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/23/iphone-18-pro-alleged-dynamic-island-size/">narrower Dynamic Island area</a>.

            Apple is reportedly evaluating a tougher display film technology for its first foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> as it tests materials that could differentiate the durability and feel of the screen from rival devices.

According to a new supply chain report from <a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=51990"><em>The Elec</em></a>, Apple is evaluating transparent polyimide film as a protective layer that would sit on top of the ultra-thin glass used in the foldable display.

In a blog post today, the company said that there are "many good places for advertising," but a "conversation with Claude is not one of them."

According to Anthropic, including ads in Claude would not be in line with its mission of creating a helpful assistant for work and deep thinking. Anthropic claims that users should not need to second-guess whether an AI is being helpful or "subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable."

There will be no ads or sponsored links in conversations with Claude, and Claude's responses will not be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <blockquote>
<p>AI is still stuck in “efficiency mode.” In many organizations, a technology organization leads AI efforts and is treated as a cost center. Those CIOs are incentivized to optimize for efficiency, not growth. The result is predictable: Tech-led AI strategies deliver productivity improvements, but not transformation. Equally concerning is that technology and AI executives tell us their business partners can’t articulate what they want from AI beyond saving money. That leadership gap bleeds over into the measurement of AI value. While most agree that AI boosts productivity, only 13% report positive EBITDA impact, and fewer than a third link AI contributions to P&amp;L. Without financial accountability, AI becomes an endless pilot treadmill — producing activity without outcomes. To shift AI from incremental savings to strategic advantage, business leaders must step in, define value in P&amp;L terms, and own the linkage between AI-driven productivity and financial performance.
But:</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Introduction Modern advertising platforms are fast-paced and interconnected: even small adjustments can have ripple effects on how ads are shown, how budgets are spent, and the value advertisers get from their ad spend. At Yelp, Ad Budget Allocation means splitting each campaign’s spend between on‑platform inventory (our website, mobile site, and app) and off‑platform inventory (the Yelp Ad Network). We optimize this split to meet advertisers’ performance goals while growing overall revenue. Due to the complexity of the budget allocation system and its feedback loop, even small changes can lead to unexpected system‑wide effects. To help us safely evaluate changes,...<br>
