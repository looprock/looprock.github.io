            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The most notable change to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> is the Liquid Glass design overhaul, which is the first major iOS design update since Apple rolled out iOS 7 back in 2013. There are new features in ‚ÄåiOS 26‚Äå, of course, but added functionality has definitely been sidelined in favor of the design refresh.

<br/>
We've compiled a walkthrough of Liquid Glass, so you know what to expect when you install ‚ÄåiOS 26‚Äå. A lot of what's here is also applicable to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a> and macOS Tahoe too.

Keep in mind that Apple is still refining Liquid Glass and some of the design could see further changes, but we'll update this guide with each revision.

Starting today, ChatGPT will provide users with "gentle reminders" about how long they've been using the service, with suggestions for breaks. OpenAI says that it isn't measuring success by time spent on ChatGPT, but by ensuring that people leave the product after finishing what they came for.

            iOS 26, currently in beta, gives you two distinct ways to add websites to your iPhone's Home screen ‚Äì as web apps or traditional bookmarks. They might look similar at first glance, but choosing the right option can dramatically improve how you access your favorite sites.

<br/>
<h2>Understanding the Difference</h2>
<br/>
When you add a website to your Home screen via Safari's "Add to Home Screen" option, iOS 26 automatically detects whether the site supports progressive web app (PWA) functionality. Web apps run almost like native apps, with features like offline access, push notifications, and a streamlined interface without Safari's address bar. In contrast, traditional bookmarks simply open the website in Safari when tapped.

            Missing the familiar Safari design from iOS 18? In iOS 26, currently in beta, Apple has learned from past criticism and made it easy to ditch the new Compact layout in favor of the classic tab layouts you may well prefer.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is hiring engineers for an "Answers, Knowledge, and Information" team that is working on improving Siri, Spotlight, Safari, and more.

<br/>
As of writing, Apple's careers website has more than a dozen job listings for the team across the U.S. and China. For example, Apple is <a href="https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/details/200602308/aiml-staff-machine-learning-engineer-answers-knowledge-information-aki">looking to hire a Staff Machine Learning Engineer</a> to help with "improving Siri's ability to answer personal domain questions." The job listing says the team develops large language models that are "responsible for answering users' questions using their personal documents with privacy at the forefront."

"Apple Cinemas is knowingly and intentionally using the name Apple to sow confusion for its own benefit," alleged attorneys for Apple, in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.287536/gov.uscourts.mad.287536.1.0.pdf">complaint</a> filed against all Apple Cinemas locations, and a Sand Media Corp Inc. company connected to the chain.

            We're on the fourth developer beta and first public beta of macOS Tahoe, which means we're getting closer to the launch version that's set to come out in September. With macOS Tahoe now available to the public, we thought it would be a good time to share an initial review of the update.

Like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, macOS Tahoe adopts the Liquid Glass design. It's used for the Dock, widgets, Control Center, menu bars, navigation bars in apps, app icons, and a few other places, but its implementation is less widespread than it is in iOS and iPadOS. It's clear that Liquid Glass was not a Mac-first design, and the glass parts of the interface feel cobbled together with the previous design language.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-01 15:40:23-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            CalDigit recently came out with the TS5 Plus, which is designed to work with Apple's Thunderbolt 5 Macs.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012987" height="1216" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/caldigit-ts5-plus.jpg" width="2162"/>
<br/>
The TS5 Plus looks like CalDigit's prior docks, featuring a simple rectangular shape and an aluminum build with some ridging at the top, bottom, and sides for visual interest and heat dissipation.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a black aluminum color that matches the Space Black of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macbook-pro/">M4 MacBook Pro</a> models, and it comes with a hefty 330W power brick. In fact, the power brick is longer than the dock itself, but it's flat and tucks away under a desk fairly well. The TS5 Plus is six inches long, five inches wide, and 1.8 inches thick, while the power brick is seven inches long, 3.5 inches wide, and a little under an inch thick.
