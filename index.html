Apple CEO Tim Cook today said to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-launch-february-19/">"get ready" for a "launch" on Wednesday, February 19</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
"Get ready to meet the newest member of the family," said Cook, in a social media post. The post includes an #AppleLaunch hashtag, along with a short video featuring an animated Apple logo inside of a circle. No other details were provided.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-13 10:17:06-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is working on a 27-inch mini-LED display that could come as soon as late 2025, display analyst <a href="https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1890099697811091590">Ross Young said today</a>. The display could be a new version of the Studio Display that Apple first introduced in 2022. The current version of the Studio Display uses a 5K LED panel, so a mini-LED version would be a significant update.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-988708" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/studio-display-purple.jpeg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Young says that the display will use mini-LEDs from Epistar, while LG Display will supply the panels.
<br/>
<br/>
Back in 2023, Young claimed that Apple had been working on a Studio Display Pro with ProMotion technology, but Apple allegedly canceled the project. Young at the time said that Apple wasn't working on another 27-inch display, but Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In a <a href="https://x.com/tim_cook/status/1890068457825394918">social media post</a> today, Apple CEO Tim Cook teased an upcoming "launch" of some kind scheduled for Wednesday, February 19.

<br/>
"Get ready to meet the newest member of the family," he said, with an #AppleLaunch hashtag.
<br/>
<br/>
The post includes a short video with an animated Apple logo inside a circle.
<br/>
<br/>
Cook did not provide an exact time for the launch, or share any other specific details, so his post is a bit of a mystery. However, <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1890069182286602362"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> believes the post is a teaser for Apple announcing a new iPhone SE.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today published a new <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/108266">support document</a> outlining steps to try if your Apple Watch's microphone or speaker is not working as expected.

<br/>
Apple says the steps can also be followed if the Apple Watch speaker's audio is "crackling, distorted, muffled, or intermittent."
<br/>
<br/>
The potential solutions listed include updating your Apple Watch to the latest watchOS version, restarting the Apple Watch, un-pairing and re-pairing the Apple Watch to an iPhone, checking whether Silent Mode or Do Not Disturb is turned on, cleaning the Apple Watch's microphone and speaker, and drying the Apple Watch with a microfiber cloth to ensure there is no water in the microphone and speaker areas.

<br/>
GPT-4.5 will be OpenAI's final non-chain-of-thought model, said Altman in a <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1889755723078443244">post on X (Twitter)</a>. "After that, a top goal for us is to unify o-series models and GPT-series models by creating systems that can use all our tools, know when to think for a long time or not, and generally be useful for a very wide range of tasks," he added.
<br/>
<br/>
To achieve this, GPT-5 will integrate multiple OpenAI technologies, including o3, which will no longer be available as a standalone model. Meanwhile, the free tier of ChatGPT will get unlimited access to GPT-5 at a "standard intelligence setting [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            There aren't too many 5K displays on the market that can compete with Apple's Studio Display, but ASUS recently came out with the ASUS ProArt Display 5K, which is a solid competitor. The ProArt Display 5K features a 27-inch 5K screen with 218 pixels per inch, aka retina quality.

<div class="center-wrap"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>
<br/>
ASUS sells the ProArt Display 5K for $799, so it's actually half the price of the Studio Display, and much, much cheaper than the Pro Display XDR. The ProArt Display is more generic looking than Apple's monitors, so you're not getting Apple style, but if you're used to looking at a 5K Retina display and you need a second monitor, you can get that same general screen quality at a cheaper price.

In our testing, the ProArt Display 5K was color accurate, sharp, and very similar to the Studio Display. Make sure to watch our video  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is exploring both humanoid and non-humanoid robots as future smart home products, according to Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. However, he does not expect the robots to launch for several more years, if ever.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961758" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/Apple-Robot-Thumb-1.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Kuo today <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1889694419907125342">said</a> Apple's robot projects remain in the proof-of-concept stage within the company. In the event that Apple decides to move forward with launching the robots, Kuo believes that mass production likely won't begin until 2028 or later. 
<br/>
<br/>
Kuo's prediction comes after a team of robotics researchers at Apple designed and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/06/apple-prototypes-tabletop-robot/">prototyped a lamp-like robot</a> with lifelike movements.
