            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Microsoft does not plan to bring an Xbox Cloud Gaming app to iOS at this time because there's no opportunity for monetization, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said in an interview with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24073666/microsoft-gaming-phil-spencer-interview-ps5-switch-games">The Verge</a></em>. When asked whether Apple's recent app ecosystem changes in the European Union make "room" for Xbox Cloud Gaming on iOS, Spencer said that monetization was an issue, and that the Digital Markets Act forcing Apple's updates does not "go far enough to open up competition."

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-02-15 14:51:59-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today stopped signing iOS 17.3, preventing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users from downgrading to that version of iOS. iOS 17.3 is no longer being signed following the February 8 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/apple-releases-ios-17-3-1-with-fix-for-text-bug/">release of iOS 17.3.1</a>, an update that added a fix for a text-related bug.

<br/>
Apple routinely stops signing older versions of iOS, so it is not unusual that the iOS 17.3 update is no longer available. Apple prevents users from installing older versions of iOS to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date and to prevent downgrading to older, less secure versions of the ‌iPhone‌ operating system.

iOS 17.3.1 is now the only publicly released version of iOS available, but Apple [...]<br>

iOS 18 is rumored to include new ChatGPT-like generative AI features for Siri and several built-in Apple apps.

iOS 18 will be announced at Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in June, and the update will be released to all users in September.

<p>Thanks to AI, rote tasks are ripe for automation. But is that really a good thing?</p> <p class="p-large-text" id="0Hhq57">In the show <em>Severance</em>’s dystopian workplace — is there any other kind? — employees spend their days studying arrays of numbers bobbing on their screens.

The work’s value is not apparent to the workers, who are told only that they are “refining macro-data files,” but the job is nevertheless satisfying to complete.

<p id="3CCKXp">Chatbots occupy a tricky space for users — they have to be a search engine, a creation tool, and an assistant all at once. That’s especially true for a chatbot coming from Google, which is increasingly counting on AI to supplement its search engine, its voice assistant, and just about every productivity tool in its arsenal. </p>
<p id="3U0J7o">Right now, the ultimate version of Google’s AI is Gemini Advanced, which launched last week for users willing to pay $20 per month for the privilege — the same price OpenAI charges for its upgraded ChatGPT Plus. So I plunked down $20 and decided to see how Gemini Advanced stood up to the rival service.</p>

<p>For decades, robots.txt governed the behavior of web crawlers. But as unscrupulous AI companies seek out more and more data, the basic social contract of the web is falling apart.  </p> <p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="e8LVQe">For three decades, a tiny text file has kept the internet from chaos. This text file has no particular legal or technical authority, and it’s not even particularly complicated. It represents a handshake deal between some of the earliest pioneers of the internet to respect each other’s wishes and build the internet in a way that benefitted everybody. It’s a mini constitution for the internet, written in code. </p>
