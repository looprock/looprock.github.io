            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18.2, Apple has introduced a thoughtful new feature for the Camera Control button on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models that helps prevent accidental camera launches by requiring the screen to be on before the button will register clicks.

            Apple in iOS 18.2 has reinstated a Lock Screen feature that was unceremoniously nixed from its iPhone OS two years ago, leaving many users wondering why it was taken away in the first place.

The feature in question is the on-screen volume control slider in the Lock Screen media player interface.
