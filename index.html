            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is gearing up to provide developers with resources to create apps and experiences for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset, and yesterday, the company pushed out new backend assets for the Vision Pro.

<br/>
Code for updating the battery pack that powers the Vision Pro has been introduced, along with other <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> assets needed for test versions of the device. Apple appears to have <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1682442696856686604?s=20">three different model numbers</a> for Vision Pro batteries, including A2781, A2988, and A2697. It is not clear why there are three separate numbers when Apple has only announced two-hour battery life for the device, but there could be multiple battery packs in dev [...]<br>

            Apple fought the law and &#8212; contrary to the song lyrics &#8212; it won. Years later, Apple decided it would get ahead of the law enforcement curve by attempting to engage in client-side scanning of iPhone users&#8217; content. That worked out less well for Apple, which (at least momentarily) decided making governments happy was more [&#8230;]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Google in May unveiled its first foldable smartphone, the Pixel Fold. We picked up a Pixel Fold and thought we'd check it out to see how it compares to Apple's latest iPhones.

<br/>
The Pixel Fold has a display size of 7.6 inches when it is unfolded, but when collapsed, the cover display measures in at 5.8 inches. Both displays feature a refresh rate up to 120Hz, like the latest Pro iPhones. It has a strong hinge that works at any angle, and when closed, there's no gap in the hinge. 
<br/>
<br/>
Size wise, the Pixel Fold is the perfect size for day to day use when folded thanks to the cover screen, and it's sized like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> X for reference. At 7.6 inches unfolded, it's bigger than any smartphone but smaller than an &lt;a href="https://w [...]<br>

            The beginning of the nineteenth century was a time of audacious enterprises and strange vicissitudes of fortune. Whilst Western Europe in turn submitted and struggled against a sub-lieutenant who made himself an emperor, who at his pleasure made kings and destroyed kingdoms, the ancient eastern part of the Continent; like mummies which preserve but the semblance of life, was gradually tumbling to pieces, and getting parcelled out amongst bold adventurers who skirmished over its ruins. Without mentioning local revolts which produced only short-lived struggles and trifling changes, of administration, such as that of Djezzar Pacha, who refused to pay tribute because he thought himself impregnable in his citadel of Saint-Jean-d’Acre, or that of Passevend-Oglou Pacha, who planted himself on the walls of Widdin as defender of the Janissaries against the institution of the regular militia decreed by Sultan Selim at Stamboul, there were wider spread rebellions which attacked the constitution of the Turkish Empire and [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In all that we have said hitherto concerning philosophy, we have scarcely touched on many matters that occupy a great space in the writings of most philosophers. Most philosophers—or, at any rate, very many—profess to be able to prove, by a priori metaphysical reasoning, such things as the fundamental dogmas of religion, the essential rationality of the universe, the illusoriness of matter, the unreality of all evil, and so on. There can be no doubt that the hope of finding reason to believe such theses as these has been the chief inspiration of many life-long students of philosophy. This hope, I believe, is vain. It would seem that knowledge concerning the universe as a whole is not to be obtained by metaphysics, and that the proposed proofs that, in virtue of the laws of logic such and such things must exist and such and such others cannot, are not capable of surviving a critical scrutiny. In this chapter we shall briefly consider the kind of way in which such reasoning is attempted, with a view to discover [...]<br>
