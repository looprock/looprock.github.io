            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has been soliciting Vision Pro feedback since the device launched, but this week, the company has picked up on sending out surveys. We've had several reports from Vision Pro customers who have been asked to share their thoughts about the device.

<br/>
Apple asks about Vision Pro satisfaction, environment usage, favorite features, what it's being used for, how often it's used, and how long usage sessions last. Apple also asks about guest mode and who else uses the Vision Pro, which is a curious question because it's not at all set up for multi-person usage. Some of the questions:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>Overall, how satisfied are you with your Vision Pro?</li>
<br/>
<li>What is your favorite feature or aspect of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> so far?</li></ul> [...]<br>

Incorporating quoted text when sharing a webpage link in Messages is a great way to get to the point and make it clear why the content you're sharing is relevant and interesting. It not only makes the link more engaging but also personalizes the message if it's sent in the midst of a conversation.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple used to regularly increase the base memory of its Macs up until 2011, the same year Tim Cook was appointed CEO, charts posted on Mastodon by David Schaub show.

<br/>
Earlier this year, Schaub generated two charts: One showing the <a href="https://mstdn.social/@dschaub/111813281624281698">base memory capacities of Apple's all-in-one Macs</a> from 1984 onwards, and a second depicting Apple's <a href="https://mstdn.social/@dschaub/111382154184733138">consumer laptop base RAM</a> from 1999 onwards. Both charts were recently resurfaced by the <a href="https://atp.fm/560">Accidental Tech Podcast</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
The graphs show that Apple tended to increase the base memory every two years or so, but that this trend ended when Cook took over the company from Steve Jobs. Memory increased quickly until the Mac Plus  [...]<br>

Apple told customers it never received their iPhone, even though they sent it in months ago. In many cases, the customers physically handed their iPhones to an Apple Store employee in person, so there is no possible way they could be at fault.

"Because you didn't trade in your iPhone, we are unable to complete the trade-in process," the email says, according to a screenshot shared with us by reader Quinn Everett. "The associated loan on this iPhone will resume."

While CIRP notes that Apple's installed smartphone base is higher than recorded activations, the figures show its share of new iPhone activations fell from 40% to 33% over the past year, suggesting a shift away from the higher market shares Apple enjoyed in previous years.

<br/>

            Most of us stare at our iPhones for far too long, and this constant exposure to a bright screen can strain our eyes, especially in low-light conditions or during the twilight hours. That's where the ability to dim your iPhone screen beyond the standard brightness settings becomes a game-changer. 
<br/>

<br/>
If the screen of your iPhone or iPad is too bright for comfort, the usual solution is to go to Settings ➝ Display &amp; Brightness and drag the Brightness slider to the left, or open Control Center and adjust the corresponding setting from there. However, if the lowest setting offered by the Brightness level just isn't dim enough for you, there's another way to make your screen even darker.

For the uninitiated, Gleam is a functional programming language for building type-safe systems that compiles to Erlang and JavaScript and it’s written in Rust. We discuss the inspiration and development of Gleam, how it compares to other languages, where it shines, the overwhelming amount of support Louis is getting through GitHub sponsors, what’s next for Gleam and their near-term plans for a language server.<br>
