            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-28 04:47:46-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is working to simplify the Camera Control button's design on the iPhone 18 in order to reduce costs, claims an established Chinese leaker.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964713" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-capture-button.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
The current Camera Control button on iPhone 17 models uses both capacitive and pressure sensors beneath a sapphire crystal surface. The capacitive layer detects touch gestures, while the force sensor recognizes different pressure levels for taps, presses, and swipes.
<br/>
<br/>
However, according to the Weibo-based account <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/QbbXB3KcV">Instant Digital</a>, Apple will remove the capacitive sensing layer and retain only pressure sensing recognition in the second iteration to achieve all Camera Control functions on the iPhone 18. 
<br/>
<br/>
The single-sensor approach is similar to designs found in devices like the OPPO X8 Ultra and viv [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's services business is expected to hit $100 billion in annual revenue for the first time this year, reports the <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3687fab7-3aea-4f81-9616-ed3d1f7be5b8">Financial Times</a></em>.

<br/>
Apple's services unit is expected to deliver annual revenues of $108.6 billion in the year to last month, which is up around 13 percent from the previous year. That's according to analysts' estimates at Visible Alpha.
<br/>
<br/>
If the estimates prove accurate when Apple reports its Q4 fiscal results this week, Apple's services division will be larger than the entire annual sales of Disney or Tesla this year. According to JPMorgan, services could make up a quarter of Apple's revenue but as much as 50 percent of its profit.

<p>”Tech is a pop culture. Very few of the decisions made in the industry are made rationally or empirically. Studies and tests are used to justify the emotional decisions of the executive or management class. Infrastructure and stack decisions are made hedonistically – “cool” tech that makes the engineers and devs feel good about themselves almost always gets a priority over “boring” tech that has no risks.</p>
<p>The industry, especially the software side of tech, is driven by emotion and a sense of what is fashionable. There is genuinely more grounded engineering – materials, machinery, process, supply chains, etc. – taking place in the fashion industry than there ever has been in the software industry.”</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            For the 20th anniversary iPhone due in 2027, Apple is developing a solid-state button system as a wholesale replacement for the device's traditional mechanical buttons. That's the latest claim from Weibo account "Instant Digital," and it's not the first of its kind from the Chinese leaker.

In its existing form, WhatsApp lets you manage storage globally by going to Settings ➝ Storage and Data ➝ Manage Storage, where files and media can be browsed from every conversation.

There's also a "Media, Links, and Docs" option within each chat's info page where you can look at all of the shared files in a conversation, but it doesn't tell you how much space each file takes up.

            <blockquote>
<p>Comparing China now to the US in the past isn&rsquo;t just a convenient rhetorical trick, it&rsquo;s arguably causal. While the full, more nuanced story deserves its own piece, the decline of the US&rsquo;s Rust Belt is definitely directly linked to the rise of China. A fate sealed by political decisions, primarily in the US, to go full &lsquo;free trade,&rsquo; which has meant factories leaving Ohio for Henan Province, where people work for less and companies can pollute more. Or as Wall Street called it, &ldquo;changes in policy, starting in the early 80s, but blossoming in the 90s, have allowed US companies to benefit from global labor and regulatory arbitrage, which has increased both their profits, size, and subsequent influence on labor, industrial, and regulatory policy.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>I grew up as a programmer in the 2000s, in Java culture. The aesthetics were about elegance, understandable simplicity (the opposite of the Perl obfuscation awards), and lots of DRY.</p>
<p>In contrast, you have command line culture, which I suspect is a more dominate programming aesthetic nowadays.</p>
<p>It will become even more so as one off vibe scripts and apps spread. If it&rsquo;s faster or just complete rewrite your code with AI, why bother to fix it?</p>

            Apple today scored a victory in a long-running antitrust lawsuit when the judge overseeing the case decertified it. The antitrust lawsuit was originally filed in 2011, accusing Apple of monopolizing the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> app ecosystem by refusing to allow customers to download apps outside of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>.

            Apple could debut LOFIC camera sensor technology in its 2027 iPhone lineup, according to new information coming out of Korea. The tech would allow iPhones to capture photos with far more detail in both bright and dark areas of the same shot without losing information in either.

<br/>
LOFIC, or Lateral Overflow Integration Capacitor, is a next-generation imaging technology that enables each pixel to store varying amounts of light based on scene brightness. This allows a sensor to capture detail in both bright highlights and dark shadows within a single frame, potentially reaching up to 20 stops of dynamic range – comparable to high-end cinema cameras and approaching the range of human vision.
