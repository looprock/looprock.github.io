            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            All Apple Watch models include a stock Calculator app that offers a couple of handy features for working out how much you should tip when eating out and how much each person in a group owes if you're splitting the bill.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The two functions can be used together, but if it's just yourself dining out then you can just leave the People field set to 1. The steps below show you how it works.  
<br/>
<br/>
Note: If you see a standard percentage (%) button where the TIP button should be, you can change the calculator layout to replace it. Simply go to <strong>Settings ➝ Calculator</strong> and select <strong>Tip Function</strong> instead of <strong>Percent</strong>.

            Apple TV+ is emerging as the frontrunner to acquire additional MLB media rights currently held by ESPN, according to a <em><a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/06/02/apple-tv-emerging-as-leading-candidate-among-streamers-to-land-more-mlb-rights/">Sports Business Journal</a></em> report.

<br/>
Sources tell the publication that Apple's offer would likely exceed what NBC has proposed for the same package, particularly if focused on Sunday night games. NBC reportedly bid for all of ESPN's current MLB rights, but the league faces a familiar streaming dilemma: fewer dollars from traditional broadcasters with broader reach versus higher payments from digital platforms with smaller audiences.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WhatsApp has ended support for iOS versions older than iOS 15.1, removing the chat platform's compatibility with several iPhone models in the process. The change began on June 1, after Meta delayed it from an original planned date of May 5.

<br/>
WhatsApp is no longer compatible with iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus models. Users with those devices won't be able to access the encrypted chat service through the app unless they upgrade their iPhone. Alternatively, users can visit web.whatsapp.com in their browser, but the experience won't be the same.
<br/>
<br/>
Users who intend to upgrade can back up their WhatsApp chats to iCloud, and restore their full chat and media history to a newer, supported device using using WhatsApp's Chat Transfer feature. Instructions on how to do so are outlined in WhatsApp's &lt;a href="https://f [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            YouTube has updated its iOS app to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/youtube/id544007664?platform=iphone">version 20.22.1</a>, which now requires iOS 16 or later to install and run. The change means several older iPhone models are no longer officially compatible with the app.

<br/>
The affected devices are those that cannot upgrade beyond iOS 15 – namely, the iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and the first-generation iPhone SE. If you have an iPod touch 7, that will no longer run the app either.
<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, the YouTube app for iPad now requires iPadOS 16 or later, which means the app has discontinued support for the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 4.

Users with these older devices can still access YouTube through their web browser by visiting m.youtube.com, but the experience wo [...]<br>

<br/>
ProMotion has been limited to the Pro models since it debuted on the iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max in 2021, but several sources have suggested that Apple will this year fit the 120Hz variable refresh technology into the base iPhone 17 model, as well as the new iPhone 17 Air that replaces the Plus model in the lineup.
<br/>
<br/>
However, Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/5821279480/PuPiSAB0t">Fixed Focus Digital</a>'s sources apparently tell them that the panel being used in the upcoming non-Pro models is "just a standard 120Hz screen, not ProMotion with adaptive refresh rate." If the claim is true, it  [...]<br>

<br/>
Below, we outline everything we know about iOS 18.6 so far.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Timing</h2>
<br/>
Apple's software engineers have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/31/apple-begins-testing-ios-18-6/">internally testing iOS 18.6 since late March</a>, according to the <em>MacRumors</em> visitors logs.
<br/>
<br/>
The first betas of iOS 13.6 through iOS 16.6 were all released before WWDC over the years, while the first iOS 17.6 beta was released the week after WWDC last year, so it is hard to pinpoint exactly when the first iOS 18.6 beta will be available.

            Organizations managing large audio and video archives face significant challenges in extracting value from their media content. Consider a radio network with thousands of broadcast hours across multiple stations and the challenges they face to efficiently verify ad placements, identify interview segments, and analyze programming patterns. In this post, we demonstrate how you can automatically transform unstructured media files into searchable, analyzable content.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            There are several ways you can take screenshots on a Mac. Preview offers the option from its File menu. There's also a little screen capture app in the macOS Utilities folder called Screenshot. But the simplest and most common method is to use your Mac's built-in shortcut key combinations. 
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Taking a screenshot is as easy as hitting <strong>Shift-Command-3</strong> to capture the whole screen, or <strong>Shift-Command-4</strong> to capture a portion of the screen using the mouse cursor as a crosshair selection tool (a tap of the spacebar also turns it into a camera for capturing windows). 
<br/>
<br/>
Screenshots taken using key shortcuts are typically saved on your desktop. However, if you tack the <strong>Control</strong> key onto either of these shortcuts, macOS will copy the captured image to the clipboard instead of sa [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-02 07:11:42-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If you have ever used an Apple TV, you are likely familiar with the device's linear keyboard, which can be tedious to use if you have a lot of text to enter.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003836" height="1082" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/Apple-TV-Linear-Keyboard-Layout.png" width="1920"/>
<br/>
Fortunately, if you are tired of swiping back and forth while entering a long password, the keyboard's layout can easily be changed. To do so, open the Settings app on the Apple TV, select General → Keyboard Layout, and choose Grid instead of Linear.
<br/>
<br/>
The on-screen keyboard will then have a square layout by default.
