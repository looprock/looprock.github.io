            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The latest beta of Apple's app development tool Xcode allows developers to simulate an iPhone running the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/apple-seeds-ios-18-beta-3/">third beta of iOS 18</a>, and this has led to the discovery of some Apple Intelligence settings that are not yet available.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple users are holding onto their devices for increasingly long periods of time as upgrade cycles slow, data from <a href="https://cirpapple.substack.com/p/aging-apple-apparatus-macs">Consumer Intelligence Research Partners</a> (CIRP) suggests.

<br/>
In recent years, a shift has occurred in the behavior of Apple customers, who are increasingly opting to retain their iPhones, iPads, and Macs for extended periods before upgrading. In the most recent 12-month period, 71% of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owners and 68% of Mac owners reported that their previous device was over two years old, up from 63% and 59%, respectively, in 2020. 
<br/>
<br/>
In the specific case of the Mac, CIRP indicates a substantial increase in the length of time users keep their devices. Currently, 56% of Mac cus [...]<br>
