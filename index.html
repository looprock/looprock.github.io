            Apple released its <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-airtag/airtag">AirTag</a> item tracker in April 2021. The accessory has not received any hardware updates since, but there have been rumors about a new model.

<br/>
Below, we recap rumors about when the second-generation AirTag might be released, as well as potential new features to expect.

<h2>Timing</h2>
<br/>
Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman both expect the next AirTag to be released in 2025.
<br/>
<br/>
In October 2023, Kuo said mass production of the second-generation AirTag had been postponed from the fourth quarter of 2024 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/airtag-2-postponed-until-2025/">until some point in 2025</a>, but he did not provide a reason for the apparent change in plans.

Reviews are set to be published at the end of January, which is just ahead of when Apple plans to launch the Vision Pro.

<br/>
It is no surprise that Apple plans to have a firm hold on the review process and the experience that reviewers undergo, as it has kept headsets provided to developers similarly locked down.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>As of this writing, I know of three ways to make use of the incremental backup feature that I committed near the end of last month. I'll be interested to see how people deploy in practice. The first idea is to replace some of the full backups you're currently doing with incremental backups, saving backup time and network transfer. The second idea is to do just as many full backups as you do now, but add incremental backups between them, so that if you need to do PITR, you can use <span style="font-family: courier;">pg_combinebackup</span> to reach the latest incremental backup before the point to which you want to recover, reducing the amount of WAL that you need to replay, and probably speeding up the process quite a bit. The third idea is to give up on taking full backups altogether and only ever take incremental backups.</p><span></span><a href="https://rhaas.blogspot.com/2024/01/incremental-backups-evergreen-and-other.html#more">Read more »</a><br>
