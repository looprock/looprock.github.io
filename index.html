<br/>
Apple is said to be closely aligned with TSMC in the race to develop and implement 2nm chip technology, which will surpass their current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> chips and associated nodes in terms of transistor density, performance, and efficiency. 2nm chips are expected to be integral in underpinning future Apple silicon chips, as well as next-generation data center and artificial intelligence technology. Test results for TSMC's "N2" 2nm prototype chips have already been showcased to Apple and several other key TSMC clients as plans for upcoming chips begin to solidify.

<br/>
The unanimous verdict came after three hours of deliberation following a four-week trial looking into Google's Play store. Among Epic's allegations were that Google illegally tied together its Play store and Play Billing payment services, leaving developers having to use both for their apps to be included in the store.
<br/>
<br/>
Google collects a commission ranging from 15% to 30% on transactions completed within apps, similar to how Apple takes its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> fees.

When viewed on iPhone, spatial video appear as normal videos, but they provide an immersive viewing experience on Vision Pro that is almost three-dimensional. Combined with advanced computational videography techniques and HEVC compression, spatial memories are saved in a relatively compact file size, recorded at 30 frames per second at 1080p, and taking up to 130MB of s [...]<br>
