            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-28 05:28:30-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            An iPhone sculpted from a single seamless sheet of glass... It's a vision that was once pursued by former Apple design chief Jony Ive. While the dream was never realized, Apple could take its first tangible step toward it with an all-glass Apple Watch. Or at least that's what one leaker has today suggested.

<br/>
According to the Weibo account <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/PkEqB8dkU">Instant Digital</a>, before an all-glass iPhone ever hits the market, we could see an Apple Watch with a touch-interactive, fully-glass frame that blurs the boundaries between screen and enclosure. 
<br/>
<br/>
The Chinese leaker provided no evidence to back their claim. However, the concept appears in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/18/apple-researching-all-glass-designs/">existing Apple patents</a> that describe we [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-28 04:12:11-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Instagram has introduced a new fast-forward feature for Reels that allows users to speed through videos by holding down on either edge of the screen. The action plays content at double speed, similar to a feature already available on TikTok.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786417" height="1266" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Instagram-Feature-1.jpg" width="2250"/>
<br/>
The Meta-owned platform initially limited Reels to 15-second clips but has since expanded the maximum duration to three minutes, making playback controls increasingly necessary for users who want to quickly navigate through longer content.
<br/>
<br/>
To use the new feature, simply press and hold on the right or left side of their screen while watching a Reel. The video will then play at 2x speed, enabling you to skip to the parts that interest you most.

Instagram users have become accustomed to consuming quick, bite-sized content, so the ability to fast-forward increa [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's upcoming "iPhone Fold" will feature a foldable screen with a 4:3 aspect ratio, according to a Chinese leaker who previously leaked the book-style device's display dimensions.
<br/>

<br/>
The Weibo-based account <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PkBXPoR6V">Digital Chat Station</a> claims that Apple will adopt a "roughly" 4:3 aspect ratio on the inner display in order to achieve consistency between the outer display, as well as to ensure parity with existing iPad software.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple's iPad and iPad Pro models have maintained a 4:3 aspect ratio across generations. The ratio offers a balanced experience in both portrait and landscape orientation, making it particularly versatile for reading/browsing and split-screen multitasking.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-27 13:59:10-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In the mid-to-late 2000s, Facebook was all about staying connected with friends and family. However, as the social media platform added new features and grew over time, that core experience began to get drowned out.
<br/>

<br/>
That changes starting now, according to Meta, which today <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/03/bringing-magic-of-friends-back-to-facebook/">introduced</a> a new feature that will "bring back the joy" of classic Facebook.
<br/>
<br/>
Specifically, Meta has redesigned the Friends tab on Facebook to focus on the "magic of friends." The page now shows content from only your Facebook friends, with no recommended content or other distractions. The tab will show your friends' posts, reels, birthdays, and more, and it will continue to show your friend requests too.

            The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) just made a move that will protect bad patents at the expense of everyone else. In a&#160;memo released February 28, the USPTO further restricted access to inter partes review, or IPR—the process Congress created to let the public challenge invalid patents without having to wage million-dollar court battles.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-27 07:45:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The upcoming iOS 18.4 update for the iPhone adds an Ambient Music feature to Control Center. Below, we take a closer look at how it works.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996862" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iOS-18-4-Ambient-Music-Control-Center.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
iOS 18.4 is currently in beta, so the Ambient Music feature is not widely available yet. The update will likely be released to the general public <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/ios-18-4-next-week/">next week</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
To use the feature on iOS 18.4, open Control Center and tap on the plus sign in the top-left corner. Then, tap on "Add a Control" at the bottom of the screen, scroll down to the Ambient Music section, and add one or more of the controls.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is how Apple describes the four Ambient Music themes:<ul><li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Music for a restful sleep.</li>
<br/>
<li><strong>Chill:</strong> Music for relaxation.&lt;/li</li></ul> [...]<br>
