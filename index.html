            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Despite being more than two years old, Apple's AirPods Pro 2 still dominate the premium wireless‑earbud space, thanks to a potent mix of top‑tier audio, class‑leading noise cancellation, and Apple's habit of delivering major new features through software updates. With AirPods Pro 3 widely expected to arrive in 2025, prospective buyers now face a familiar dilemma: snap up the proven <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2 at today's prices, or hold off for the next‑generation model that could raise the bar once again.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When U.S. President Donald Trump levied 145 percent tariffs on goods imported from China, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> started working to score Apple an exemption that would keep <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> costs down.

<br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/04/17/apple-iphone-tariff-exemption-trump/">The Washington Post</a></em>, Cook had a phone call with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick last week, explaining how the tariffs would cause ‌iPhone‌ prices to increase. He talked to senior White House officials about the tariffs, and made sure not to say anything negative in public about Trump's policies that would anger Trump. For Trump's inauguration, Cook also personally donated $1 million.

            Google has an illegal monopoly in online advertising, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema said today. Google is guilty of "willfully acquiring and maintaining monopoly power" in the publisher ad server market that websites use for ads and the open-web display ad exchange market that matches advertisers with websites.

Publishers that wanted to use Google's ad exchange were also required to use its ad server, which disadvantaged competing platforms. Google's "First Look" feature gave its ad exchange the first right of refusal for impressions, and "Last Look" let its platform assess bids from competitors before making its own bid.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18.4, Apple added a new Shortcuts action to open a specific conversation in the Messages app. This means it's now possible to open a chat thread with someone important to you straight from your Lock Screen, for example. Keep reading to learn more.

<br/>
If you'd like to reduce the time it takes to chat with a frequently contacted person, this new shortcut action is for you. Placing a shortcut on your Lock Screen to a spouse or family member's chat thread allows you to contact them without navigating through the app, making it perfect for quick updates, urgent communications, or daily check-ins.
<br/>
<br/>
The feature also streamlines interactions by minimizing distractions, since it lets you bypass the Messages interface, so you won't be tempted to engage with other messages or notifications. It co [...]<br>

            Apple's iPhone development roadmap runs several years into the future and the company is continually working with suppliers on several successive iPhone models simultaneously, which is why we often get rumored features months ahead of launch. The iPhone 17 series is no different, and we already have a good idea of what to expect from Apple's 2025 smartphone lineup.

If you skipped the iPhone 16, or if you're just plain curious about what's on the horizon, here are 17 rumored features that we are expecting to arrive in time for Apple's successor lineup, the iPhone 17 series, which is likely to be released around mid-September.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has seemingly had one of its most useful AI tools blocked from Meta's apps. Writing Tools, which is an Apple Intelligence feature, is not available to use in Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, and Messenger.

Apple's Writing Tools include options to proofread, rewrite, and summarize text almost anywhere you can type in iOS 18. A long press in a text input field usually brings up the feature, but not in any of Meta's apps currently.
