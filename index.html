            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-28 04:12:11-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Instagram has introduced a new fast-forward feature for Reels that allows users to speed through videos by holding down on either edge of the screen. The action plays content at double speed, similar to a feature already available on TikTok.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786417" height="1266" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Instagram-Feature-1.jpg" width="2250"/>
<br/>
The Meta-owned platform initially limited Reels to 15-second clips but has since expanded the maximum duration to three minutes, making playback controls increasingly necessary for users who want to quickly navigate through longer content.
<br/>
<br/>
To use the new feature, simply press and hold on the right or left side of their screen while watching a Reel. The video will then play at 2x speed, enabling you to skip to the parts that interest you most.
<br/>

Instagram users have become accustomed to consuming quick, bite-sized content, so the ability to fast-forward increa [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-28 03:44:46-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's upcoming "iPhone Fold" will feature a foldable screen with a 4:3 aspect ratio, according to a Chinese leaker who previously leaked the book-style device's display dimensions.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The Weibo-based account <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PkBXPoR6V">Digital Chat Station</a> claims that Apple will adopt a "roughly" 4:3 aspect ratio on the inner display in order to achieve consistency between the outer display, as well as to ensure parity with existing iPad software.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple's iPad and iPad Pro models have maintained a 4:3 aspect ratio across generations. The ratio offers a balanced experience in both portrait and landscape orientation, making it particularly versatile for reading/browsing and split-screen multitasking. Only the 8.3-inch iPad mini has deviated from the traditional ratio, [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-27 13:59:10-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In the mid-to-late 2000s, Facebook was all about staying connected with friends and family. However, as the social media platform added new features and grew over time, that core experience began to get drowned out.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786419" height="1266" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Facebook-Feature.jpg" width="2250"/>
<br/>
That changes starting now, according to Meta, which today <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/03/bringing-magic-of-friends-back-to-facebook/">introduced</a> a new feature that will "bring back the joy" of classic Facebook.
<br/>
<br/>
Specifically, Meta has redesigned the Friends tab on Facebook to focus on the "magic of friends." The page now shows content from only your Facebook friends, with no recommended content or other distractions. The tab will show your friends' posts, reels, birthdays, and more, and it will continue to show your friend requests too.

The company is promoting Vanessa Trigub to a new role as "vice president of stores and retail operations." Previously, she handled retail operations and managed locations in the Americas West region. Going forward, she will supervise the heads of retail for Europe and the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and the Americas East regions. The new, simplified structure for retail affords Trigub more responsibility. She started out at Apple as an intern around the launch of the original &lt;a href="https: [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Last week, we covered a report claiming that Apple's book-style foldable iPhone (or "iPhone Fold," as we are provisionally calling it here) will use liquid metal hinges to improve durability and help minimize screen creasing. Today, a Chinese leaker provided more details on the properties of this hinge material that help to clarify why Apple chose it for its first foldable device.

<br/>
According to the Weibo account <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/Pkvb9FIcN">Instant Digital</a>, Apple has chosen metallic glass (amorphous metal) for the iPhone Fold's hinge mechanism. Industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has previously referred to Apple's use of "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/21/apple-liquid-metal-foldable-iphone-hinges/">liquid metal</a>," which is a common marketing term for the same thing.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is preparing to sell new Beats-branded charging cables, according to placeholder product listings on a handful of reseller websites in Canada and Europe.

<br/>
There are listings for three different 5-foot/1.5-meter cables, including USB-C to USB-C, USB-C to Lightning, and USB-C to USB-A variants. All of the cables have a tangle-free, braided design for extra durability and convenience. The cables will be available in at least three never-before-seen color options, including Bolt Black, Surge Stone, and Rapid Red, and it appears that they will be sold in one-pack and two-pack varieties.
<br/>
<br/>
The USB-C to USB-C cable supports 60W fast charging, and it has USB 2.0 data transfer speeds of up to 480 Mbps, according to one of the listings.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple regularly refreshes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> models, and a new version that uses M5 series chips is in the works. Apple just finished refreshing most of the Mac lineup with M4 chips, and now it's time for the M5. Rumors suggest that we could see the first M5 ‌MacBook Pro‌ models this fall.

<br/>
<h2>Design</h2>
<br/>
There have been no rumors of a design update for the M5 ‌MacBook Pro‌ models that are coming this fall, so we are expecting the same look as the current models. There might be minor updates, but most of the changes will be internal.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple probably won't change the design of the ‌MacBook Pro‌ until it transitions to OLED display technology, and that's not rumored to happen until 2026 at the earliest.

            Utah today passed the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> Accountability Act, a law that requires mobile app stores from Apple and Google to verify the age of users rather than having individual apps do age verification.

According to <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/26/utah-adopts-child-safety-law-requiring-apple-google-to-verify-user-ages.html">CNBC</a></em>, Utah Governor Spencer Cox signed the bill this afternoon. It is the first law related to mobile app store age verification that has passed in the U.S., and it will require Apple to verify user age when an Apple Account is created. If a child under the age of 18 opens an account, Apple will need to link the account to a parent's account, and parents will have to consent to app purchases.
