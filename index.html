            Apple plans to launch a second-generation iPhone 17e next spring, reports Korean outlet <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=37930">The Elec</a></em>.

<br/>
According to the report, the iPhone 17e will use the same OLED panel as that found in the iPhone 16e – a panel that originally debuted in the iPhone 14 – as part of its efforts to use lower-cost components based on established production lines. 
<br/>
<br/>
Similar to the iPhone 16e, which launched in February of this year starting $599, BOE and Samsung are said to be supplying the display panels, though LG Display may also be involved. The iPhone 16e offers a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, an A18 chip, and a USB-C port, positioning it as a more affordable alternative within the iPhone 16 family.

Being a dad, I got excited to explain a simple thing in detail, “well,” I started. “No, let’s ask the circle!” and by that she meant voice mode in ChatGPT.</p><p>So we did: “Well, saying ‘please’ is kind of a way to show respect and appreciation when you’re asking someone for something. It just helps to make the interaction a bit more polite and friendly, which usually makes people more willing to help you out.”</p><p>Of course, I immediately wanted to ask the logical follow up question, “yes, but <em>why</em> does it show respect and appreciation” which is the crux of the question, and then another: and why is that ‘nice’? This the important thing: saying the effect of something - saying “please” - doesn’t tell you the why and how of something. (In marketing, I’d call this outcomes based marketing, which you’re encouraged to do when marketing text to “executives.”)</p><p>But there were more important things in the </p> [...]<br>
