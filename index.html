In the U.S., a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/848452424/Martin-et-al-v-Apple-Inc">complaint</a> filed in a California federal court this week alleges that Apple violated false advertising and unfair competition laws by marketing Apple Intelligence upgrades for Siri that are still not available.

Apple apparently weighed up multiple options for the backend of ‌Apple Intelligence‌. One initial idea was to build both small and large language models, dubbed "Mini Mouse" and "Mighty Mouse," to run locally on iPhones and in the cloud, respectively. ‌Siri‌'s leadership then decided to go in a different direction and build a single large language model to handle all requests via the cloud, before a series of further technical pivots.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Instagram seems to be testing locked reels that require viewers to enter a keyword or a code to be able to see the hidden content. It's a feature that creators could use to increase engagement or to share content with their most loyal fans.
<br/>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The an upcoming version of watchOS will bring a visionOS-like redesign to the Apple Watch, much like the design updates coming in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a> and macOS 16, claims Israeli site <em><a href="https://theverifier.co.il/71516/exclusive-watchos-apple-intelligence-hi-visionos/">The Verifier</a></em>.

<br/>
watchOS will eventually have "elements" of visionOS, including a look that is bolder, slightly transparent, and with a floating aesthetic. Buttons, menus, icons, and other user interface elements will reportedly be refreshed, with Apple "working on several ideas" for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a>. <em>The Verifier</em> does not know when these design changes will come, as the features are allegedly still being developed.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today shared a minute-long video promoting the Emergency SOS feature on the Apple Watch, highlighting the rescue of Australian man Rick Shearman, who was swept out to sea last July.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Shearman was swimming in Byron Bay when rough seas pushed him away from shore, with the current carrying him over 1.5 kilometers from the beach. He couldn't get past the waves, and after about 20 minutes of trying to get to shore, he realized he needed help.
<br/>
<br/>
He called emergency services using the Emergency SOS feature on his Apple Watch, with the call played back in Apple's ad spot in a dramatic reenactment of the event. He was able to source help, and stayed on the line with emergency crews for an hour to direct them to his location. He was ultimately rescued by helicopter.

When asked whether he would consider exempting some U.S. companies from the tariffs in the future, Trump said that he would. "As time goes by, we're going to take a look at it," he said.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple stock is on the rise after U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to pause most tariffs for a 90-day period. Tariffs are immediately on hold in countries that have not enacted retaliatory tariffs, which means this pause does not apply to China, but it is applicable in other countries where Apple suppliers operate like India, Vietnam, and Taiwan.

<br/>
While Trump has paused tariffs in most countries, he raised tariffs on incoming Chinese goods to 125 percent, up from 104 percent earlier today. The 125 percent tariff is effective immediately, and comes after China raised tariffs on U.S. goods to 84 percent this morning.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Postgres is a data storage tool, and as a tool it is neutral in how it is used.  Tools can be used for good, for harm, and because Postgres is open source, the community doesn't even
know how it is used.
</p>
<p>My first knowledge of non-traditional uses of Postgres was in 2003 during a Postgres <a class="txt2html" href="https://bignerdranch.com/" style="text-decoration: none;">training.</a>  During a break, someone whispered to me that one of the
attendees was from a pornographic video company, and that Postgres was very popular in that industry.  The more I thought about it, the more it made sense — many database companies
didn't want to do business with them, but Postgres was open source so they could use it easily.
</p>
<p>The flexibility of Postgres to be used without restrictions didn't become apparent to me again until 2014, when Russia invaded
