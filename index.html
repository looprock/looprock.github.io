            As we approach the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 17e, <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera decided to take a look back at the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a>. He goes over what it's been like using Apple's budget ‌iPhone‌ over the past 12 months, and whether it's worth choosing over one of Apple's more expensive models.

<blockquote>"Preserving the privacy of child predators is absolutely inexcusable. And more importantly, it violates West Virginia law.

            <p>Your Boss Doesn’t Know What to Do With AI</p>
<p>Enterprise AI Has a Product-Market Fit Problem. Enterprise AI isn’t stalled because the models are weak. It’s stalled because we haven’t discovered product-market fit inside the enterprise yet.</p>
<p>You don’t find real AI value by theorizing in workshops. You find it by running experiments for months inside your actual systems - against real data - in a governed environment.</p>
<p>That requires a platform.</p>
<p>Without one, AI pilots turn into disconnected experiments, shadow infrastructure, and compliance risk. With one, experimentation compounds into institutional learning.</p>
<p>In this video, I break down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why enterprise AI is still in discovery mode</li>
<li>Why experimentation must be long-running, not one-off</li>
<li>How governance enables innovation instead of blocking it</li>
<li>Why a secure platform foundation is the baseline for AI ROI</li>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Iteration has long been one of the more fragmented areas of Go, with developers relying on ad hoc patterns to traverse custom data structures. This article explores the range-over-functions experiment, a proposed evolution of the language that introduces a standardized iterator model while preserving Go&rsquo;s familiar for range syntax. Using the new iter package and sequence abstractions, it shows how iteration logic can be expressed more clearly, flexibly, and idiomatically. Originally published in April 2024, the concepts remain highly relevant as Go continues to evolve toward more expressive yet simple language features.</p><br>
