            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Starting next week, Apple's retail stores will no longer offer AppleCare+ plans as a one-time purchase, according <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1886083012967948722">to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

Instead, he said the stores will only offer AppleCare+ as a subscription. For example, AppleCare+ for the iPhone 16 Pro Max costs $9.99 per month, or $199 upfront for two years. The latter option would no longer be available at Apple's stores.

Fortunately, Gurman said AppleCare+ will remain available as a one-time purchase on Apple's online store, at least for now.

<br/>
It is unclear if this policy change is limited to the U.S. or will apply worldwide.

Apple likely profits more by offering AppleCare+ as a monthly or annual subscription, which helps to boos [...]<br>
