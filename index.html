At WWDC last year, Apple announced that No Man's Sky would be available for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and Mac would by the end of 2022. Hello Games missed that deadline and the game is finally available for the Mac as of today. Hello Games founder Sean Murray teased two upcoming Apple-related announcements earlier this week. Today, Murray seemingly confirmed that the launch for Mac is one of the two teased announcements, meaning another is soon to follow.
