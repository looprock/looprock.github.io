            Samsung <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/10/samsung-galaxy-z-fold6-flip6/">this week introduced</a> its latest earbuds, the <a href="https://howl.me/cmDIUN6mU8k">Galaxy Buds3 Pro</a>, which look quite a bit like Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2. Given the similarities, we thought we'd compare Samsung's new earbuds to the ‌AirPods Pro‌.

Design wise, you could potentially mistake Samsung's Galaxy Buds3 Pro for the ‌AirPods Pro‌. The Buds3 Pro have the same general shape and a silicone tip, though it's worth noting that the Buds3 Pro come in both white and gray, so you're not limited to white as you are with the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2. The charging case is similar to the AirPods Charging Case too, but there's a transparent upper portion.

Not all of the new features Apple showed off at WWDC last month will be available right away, however, with some rolling out in later iOS 18 updates over the next year. In particular, significant Siri enhancements with Apple Intelligence are reportedly slated for iOS 18.4 in the spring of 2025.
