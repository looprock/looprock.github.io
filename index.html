<br/>
The Home screen widget offers only one kind, called "X News Highlights," which displays headlines of what's trending on the social media platform. The widget is available in three sizes.
<br/>
<br/>
There's more to be said for the Lock Screen widgets, which all come in larger and smaller kinds. "X Notifications" shows the user's notification count, while "X Messages" displays the number of unread messages in X Chat (encrypted DMs). There are also two Grok AI widgets, one for jumping straight into chat and one for voice conversations.

            Apple is preparing to bring support for its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/carkey/">Car Keys</a> feature to Toyota vehicles, evidence uncovered by <em>MacRumors</em> suggests.

Toyota introduced its own Digital Key feature as part of the available Remote Connect package several years ago, which allows drivers to use their smartphone as a key to access and drive the vehicle.

            <p>Enterprises have a habit of &ldquo;professionalizing&rdquo; consumer tech by adding control - security, compliance, cost management, approved architectures. All reasonable. And often exactly what kills the thing.</p>
<p>Heroku and early cloud worked because they <em>removed</em> friction: no tickets, no permission, no approved stack. Developers could move fast, make local tradeoffs, and live with the consequences.</p>
<p>Enterprise adoption usually means re-introducing the friction the tech was designed to eliminate. It&rsquo;s called maturity. It feels like regression.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Eventually, software is very hard to change. There are numerous reasons for this, and they often don’t even involve the software. The systems that run the software are old, regulators don’t let you change things, security controls, people have just forgotten how to program COBOL. There is so much code that it’s hard to know what the code does.</p>
<p>So when you want to change it, you don’t know what to do. The ultimate sign of legacy software is that you don’t know how to test it after making changes. If you can’t test software, you can’t safely make changes, the Michael Feathers definition of legacy code.</p>
<p>I could get distracted by discussing the reasons, but we all know that <a href="https://cote.io/legacytrap/">software just becomes “legacy” at some point</a>.</p>
<p>This means that you have to figure out building software that will be valuable in the long-term before the software calcifies. Early on you can change things, more or less at will</p> [...]<br>

The report said the features are referenced within the code for a leaked internal build of iOS 26 that is not meant to be seen by the public. However, it appears that Espósito and/or his sources managed to gain access to it, providing us with a sneak peek at some of the things that Apple's software engineers are working on.
<br/>
<br/>
As always, Apple's plans could change, so there is no guarantee that any or all of these features will end up being released to the general public.

<blockquote>
<p>For generative AI (GenAI) apps to deliver real business value, they need access to your company’s proprietary data. Without it, models default to the public data they were trained on–meaning you get the same generic ideas as your competitors. If everyone is starting with the same new ideas, competitive advantage disappears. This is exactly like hiring an outside consultant and refusing to show them how your business actually operates.</p>
<p>APIs are the predominant way to give GenAI apps access to this crucial data. This is leading to a massive proliferation of custom endpoints that are skipping rigorous security checks, governance, and cost analysis. This phenomenon is not new.
