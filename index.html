            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            While Apple refreshed the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> in May 2024, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> is still in need of an update. Apple last introduced a new ‌iPad mini‌ in September 2021, so it's overdue for an overhaul.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-08-27 11:57:19-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            It has been nearly four years since Apple released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>, so an update to the over-ear headphones is highly anticipated.
<br/>

<br/>
Below, we recap the latest rumors about the AirPods Max.
<br/>
<br/>
As a refresher, Apple released the AirPods Max in December 2020, after announcing them in a press release shared on the Apple Newsroom website. The headphones have not received any hardware upgrades since, leading some customers to hold off on their purchase and hope that Apple will eventually release AirPods Max 2.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, rumors suggest that AirPods Max 2 are not coming any time soon, with only minor revisions expected for the headphones later this year.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-08-26 08:31:30-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple in iOS 18 has made a wealth of customization options available for your iPhone Home Screen, one of which is the ability to add a tint to your app icons.  
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957459" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iOS-18-Home-Screen-Feature-1.5.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Essentially, the tint feature offers a unique way to customize your device's appearance by changing the color of all your icons at once. Unlike individual icon customization, tinting affects every icon on your app pages, Home Screen, and App Library, creating a unified look across your entire interface.
<br/>
<br/>
Tinting works by first desaturating all icons and then applying a single color overlay. This process results in a monochromatic appearance, which means you'll lose the original colors of your app icons and widgets, but what you gain is a more cohesive look. It's a powerful tool for creating a coordinated, stylish interface that reflects your [...]<br>
