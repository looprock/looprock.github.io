<br/>
Instead of the familiar split between standard and Pro models, Apple this year introduced the new ‌iPhone Air‌ and expanded the feature gap between tiers. The result is a predicament between the affordable and practical ‌iPhone 17‌, and the super-thin and all-new ‌iPhone Air‌, with distinct trade-offs in size, materials, camera hardware, and battery life along the way. While they both share brighter displays, ProMotion, and an all-new 18-megapixel camera, their designs, display sizes, and camera features are more specialized than ever before.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's new iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max models are now being delivered to customers worldwide following the pre-order period that began on Friday, September 12. For those who didn't pre-order or chose to wait, many configurations on Apple's online store in the U.S. and elsewhere are facing an additional 1-3 week shipping delay beyond launch day, with delivery estimates pushing into late September to mid-October. However, delivery or in-store pickup at select Apple Store locations on launch day is still an option.

            With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> models now rolling out in Australia and New Zealand, Apple has shared a new ad for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> on its Australian YouTube channel.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>

The spot features a film director using an ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ to film in a range of messy conditions, with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> exposed to all mud, snow, and more. The ad will likely be added to Apple's other YouTube channels tomorrow.

<br/>
The ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ has a three-lens camera system, with a trio of 48-megapixel lenses. The new Telephoto lens features 4x and 8x optical zoom options.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Meta this week unveiled $800 smart glasses that include an in-lens display. The new <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/meta-ray-ban-display-ai-glasses-connect-2025/">Meta Ray-Ban Display</a> AI glasses allow you to check messages, view photos, and interact with Meta AI without the need to use a smartphone.

<br/>
There is a full-color, high-resolution display included in the glasses, along with cameras, microphones, and speakers. Meta says that the included monocular display has a custom light engine and custom module that provides sharp contrast and high brightness. There are 42 pixels in each degree of the field of view.
<br/>
<br/>
Meta placed the display off to the side to prevent it from obstructing the view through the glasses, and the display is also not designed to be on constantly. It is meant for short interactions.

<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The battery inside the accessory has an unusual shape, leading iFixit to conclude that it's possible that Apple is using the same battery for the ‌iPhone Air‌ and the ‌iPhone Air‌ ‌MagSafe‌ Battery.
<br/>
<br/>
iFixit compared the battery in the ‌MagSafe‌ Battery pack to the ‌iPhone Air‌ battery that Apple showed off when introducing the new device, and it does appear to be a close match if not identical.
<br/>
<br/>
The battery has a 12.26Wh capacity, and it is 2.72mm thick, which means it is thin enough to fit inside the 5.6mm ‌iPhone Air‌.

            Everything is changing. Adam is joined by his good friend Beyang Liu from Sourcegraph — this time, talking about Amp (ampcode.com). Amp is one of the many, and one of Adam's favorite agentic coding tools to use. What makes it different is how they've engineered to it to maximize what’s possible with today’s frontier models. Autonomous reasoning, access to the oracle, comprehensive code editing, and complex task execution. That's nearly verbatim from their homepage, but it's also exactly what Adam has experienced. They talk through all things agents, how Adam might have been holding Amp wrong, and they even talked through Adam's idea called "Agent Flow". If you're babysitting agents, this episode is for you.<br>
