            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple devices support a relatively unknown three-finger gesture that lets you share a photo across your devices in super-quick time. It's a neat trick to fall back on if AirDrop is playing up or your iCloud Photos are taking ages to sync.

<br/>
Universal Clipboard is usually associated with copying and pasting text, but by using this gesture, you can make it work really well for sharing images between your devices too.
<br/>
<br/>
It can be used to quickly copy images across nearby devices for pasting into Messages, Notes, emails, Pages, and other apps with input fields.
<br/>
<br/>
For the following steps to work, you'll need to have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned on and your devices signed into the same Apple Account and connected to the same network.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL88A5F9V3k">new ad</a> for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-use-clean-up-tool-photos/">Clean Up feature</a> in the Photos app, which can identify and remove distracting objects from the background of a photo.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
In the video, a man flexes his muscles in front of a mirror, while a woman takes photos of him with an iPhone. Later, the man realizes that the woman is visible in the mirror in the background of the photos, so he uses the Clean Up tool to remove her. The ad emphasizes the ease of using the feature, but in reality it does not always work perfectly.
<br/>
<br/>
Clean Up is an Apple Intelligence feature, meaning that it is only available on the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, or any iPhone 16 model. It was one of the first Apple Intelligence features to roll out, as part of iOS 18.1 last year.<div class="linkback">Tags: &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads</div> [...]<br>
