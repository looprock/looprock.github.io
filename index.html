            Apple today received approval to sell the HomePod mini in Malaysia, according to a local regulatory filing <a href="https://twitter.com/XavierNaxa/status/1745442408656179388">uncovered by Xavier Naxa</a>.

<br/>
It's unclear when the HomePod mini will be available in Malaysia, but sales will presumably begin on Apple's online store there within the next few months. Apple has yet to receive approval to sell the full-size second-generation HomePod in the country.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple first released the HomePod mini in October 2020 in the U.S., and it is now sold in around 25 countries. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/homepod-mini-new-colors/">New color options</a> were added in November 2021, and the speaker's previously-unused temperature and humidity sensor was &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/hom [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When Apple first unveiled its next-generation Vision Pro headset at WWDC 2023, the company shared promotional videos that briefly teased the potential applications of using the $3,499 spatial computing device in conjunction with a Mac. 
<br/>

<br/>
Despite Apple's announcement that Vision Pro will launch on February 2, Apple has yet to expand on the specifics of how the two devices work together. But sift through code and marketing materials, and there are subtle indications about what is possible - and what the limitations are likely to be. Here's what we know.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is working on an iOS 17.3 update, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/apple-releases-ios-17-3-beta-3-to-developers/">has seeded three betas</a> to developers and public beta testers so far. The update isn't quite as large as the prior iOS 17.2 update <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-3-beta-features/">in terms of new features</a> so the testing period won't be as long, and we are expecting it to launch before the end of January.

<br/>
In terms of timing, a launch the week of January 22nd might make the most sense. We've had three betas, two of which have not added anything particularly notable, suggesting there isn't much testing left. If Apple plans to launch the update on the 22nd or the 23rd, we can expect to see the release candidate version of the iOS 17.3 update on the 15th, followed by the la [...]<br>
