This comes amid rumors of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-mini-led-studio-display/">new Studio Display with mini-LED backlighting</a> launching by 2026.
<br/>
<br/>
Below, we recap the latest rumors.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Pro Display XDR 2</h2>
<br/>
Released in December 2019, the Pro Display XDR features a 32-inch screen with LED backlighting, 6K resolution, a 60Hz refresh rate, P3 wide color, up to 1,600 nits of brightness, a Thunderbolt 3 port, and three USB-C ports. In the U.S., the Pro Display XDR start [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is "exploring" the idea of showing search ads in the Apple Maps app, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-16/apple-and-meta-are-set-to-battle-over-new-area-humanoid-robots-m77mwid3"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

<br/>
Back in 2022, Gurman said software engineering was "already underway" to display ads in the Apple Maps app, but Apple did not move forward with the idea at the time. Today, he said Apple is "giving this notion more thought" again.
<br/>
<br/>
This time around, he said Apple has yet to start engineering work, so ads in the Apple Maps app might still be a ways away.
<br/>
<br/>
Ads in the Apple Maps app would not be the traditional banner ads that you see on websites, but rather paid search results. For example, a fast food chain could pay Apple to appear near the to [...]<br>

Price-wise, this monitor sits $400 either side of the Apple and ASUS offerings at $1,200. As you'd expect, it packs more features than the cheaper ASUS display. For a start, it's Thunderbolt 4.

The integration currently seems restricted to Netflix Original content rather than the service's full catalog of licensed shows and movies. When users select content to watch, they are still directed to the Netflix app for playback.
