<p id="EsULOo">Amazon’s cloud business AWS launched a chat tool called <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2023/11/aws-announces-amazon-q-to-reimagine-the-future-of-work">Amazon Q</a>, where businesses can ask questions specific to their companies.</p>
<p id="5gNwIw">Announced during a keynote speech by AWS CEO Adam Selipsky at AWS re:Invent, Amazon Q acts like an AI assistant where users can ask questions about their businesses using their data. For example, employees can query Amazon Q on the company’s latest guidelines for logo usage or understand another engineer’s code to maintain an app. Q can surface the information instead of the employee sifting through dozens of documents. </p>

Users can watch a custom Highlight Reel at the top of the Replay webpage before diving into more detailed information and expanded listening insights. The highlight reel presents a series of social media-style animated cards that show musical highlights from the past year based on your listening history. Relevant music plays in the background for each card. The highlight reel is viewable on desktop browsers, but it appears to be primarily designed for mobile devices.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-11-28 05:31:06-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Work on multiple next-generation Vision Pro headsets is ongoing, according to two new reports coming out of Asia.

<br/>
<em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20231127PD223.html">DigiTimes</a></em> claims that there are a total of four different second-generation Vision Pro headsets in development, including a direct successor to the first-generation model and a more affordable model. The nature of the other two second-generation models is unclear. 
<br/>
<br/>
The bill of materials (BOM) for the more affordable headset will reportedly be half that of the first-generation Vision Pro to enable a significantly reduced retail price. Samples of this device are apparently set to begin production in the second half of 2024, with launch following in the second half of 2025 at the earliest.

            For decades, the FCC has maintained an arguably pathetic definition of &#8220;broadband,&#8221; allowing the telecom industry to under-deliver substandard access. And despite some new rhetoric from the agency under Biden, that doesn&#8217;t appear to be changing anytime soon. Broadband was originally defined as any 200 kbps connection. In 2010, that pathetic definition was changed to [&#8230;]<br>
