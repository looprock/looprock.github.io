            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-26 04:46:50-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/id/newsroom/2025/03/iphone-16-lineup-available-from-11-April/">announced</a> the official release date of its iPhone 16 lineup in Indonesia, after the country lifted a ban on its sale following Apple's more than $300 million investment plan. The iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max, and iPhone 16e will launch in the Indonesian market on April 11.

<br/>
The announcement indicates that the iPhone 16 series has passed the Indonesian telecommunications equipment certification – the final hurdle in the approvals process. Previously, the iPhone 16 models also obtained the local component content (TKDN) certification issued by the Indonesian Ministry of Industry, with a standard rate of 40%, exceeding the current minimum requirement of 35%.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-26 04:06:40-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's forthcoming iPhone 17 Pro models are capable of shooting 8K video, up from the current maximum 4K capture resolution on the iPhone 16 series, a Chinese leaker has today suggested. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990064" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-17-Pro-Render-Front-Page-Tech.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
The Weibo-based account <a href="https://weibo.com/5821279480/PklblyXJq">Fixed Focus Digital</a> on Wednesday said that the iPhone 17 Pro is "something to look forward to," since 8K video will be "within the user's grasp." 
<br/>
<br/>
It turns out the leaker could be onto something.
<br/>
<br/>
Last September, one report claimed that Apple allegedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/06/iphone-16-pro-4k-at-120fps-video-rumor/">tested 8K video recording</a> on the iPhone 16 Pro models. However, the capability was never enabled, likely because of hardware limitations in the current triple-lens camera setup.

<br/>
For context, audio files are typically compressed to keep file sizes smaller. There are lossy compression standards like MP3, and Apple's own Advanced Audio Codec (AAC), which result in some data loss. Then, there are lossless compression standards like Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC), which preserve all of the original data. The entire Apple Music catalog of more than 100 million songs is encoded in both AAC and ALAC.
