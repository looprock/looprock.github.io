            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The next-generation iPad Air will be equipped with a landscape front camera, according to the <a href="https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1769727515453800930">leaker known as "ShrimpApplePro."</a>

<br/>
If this information is accurate, the front camera on the next iPad Air would be located in the bezel to the right of the screen when the device is held upright. As a result, the front camera would be positioned at the top of the iPad when the device is in landscape orientation, making it centered with the user's eyes during video calls. This change would be especially beneficial to those who use the iPad Air with a Magic Keyboard.
<br/>
<br/>
On the current iPad Air, the front camera is in the top bezel above the screen, resulting in it being off-center in landscape orientation.

            For decades, U.S. broadband providers have struck cozy deals with landlords effectively elbowing out competitors and allowing them to create building-by-building broadband monopolies. That stifled competition results in higher costs, slow speeds, and worse overall service.

<em>MacRumors</em> previously reported that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/apple-preparing-ios-17-4-1/">internally testing iOS 17.4.1</a>. As a minor update for the iPhone, it will likely address software bugs and/or security vulnerabilities. It is unclear if the update will include any other changes.
<br/>
<br/>
As to be expected, Apple has also been internally testing iOS 17.5, and the first beta of that update is likely to be released this week.

We consider it likely that there will also be a macOS 14.4.1 update for the Mac at some point, as there have been complaints about several bugs on macOS 14.4 &lt;a href=" [...]<br>

            This week Adam went solo — talking to Kyle Wiens, Founder and CEO at iFixit, about all things Right to Repair. They discussed the latest win here in the US with Oregon passing an electronics Right to Repair law to allow owners the right to get their stuff fixed anywhere as well as limit the anti-repair practices of parts pairing. They also discussed the history of the DMCA, the challenges posed by Section 1201, the challenges of recycling products with glued-in batteries, the need for producer responsibility, the future of repairability, repair scoring systems to inform consumers, and so much more. Did you know that iFixit funds its advocacy work through the sale of its tools and parts? So cool.<br>

Keeping a fresh, consistent UI on all these clients is a major challenge. Server-driven UI (SDUI) has become a standard industry technique for managing UI on multiple platforms. At Yelp, many product teams created SDUI frameworks for their features. Though successful, these frameworks were expensive to develop and maintain, and no single SDUI framework supported all our clients.
