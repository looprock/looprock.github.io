            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            As we look towards the future, the potential adoption of Nostr by Twitter could signal the dawn of a new era for social media. This would be an era characterized by genuine user control, where the power dynamics are shifted back to the individuals who form the backbone of these platforms. It's a bold vision, indeed, but one that I firmly believe is worth pursuing by Twitter, Threads, and other social media platforms. A social media landscape where users are truly in control, where data ownership is the default and expectations, and where platforms compete on providing the best user experience rather than controlling the most data, is a landscape that promises greater freedom, inclusivity, and innovation.<br>
