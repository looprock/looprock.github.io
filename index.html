            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>We’re solidly in the “you’re doing it wrong” era of AI hustling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The companies that are thriving in the AI era are doing much more than building models. They’re building systems. They’re aggregating data, governance and workflows into AI-ready infrastructure that delivers at scale. If you’re stuck in pilot purgatory, this is your roadmap out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The McKinsey survey shows one clear signal of progress – workflow redesign. The companies with more success in using effectively using AI, about half say they’re using technology not just to do things faster, but to essentially rewrite how their business works. Most are actively rebuilding how work moves between people and systems. It’s a shift from fine-tuning the old way to creating something new entirely–and that’s what separates real transformation from just minor upgrades.</p>

            <p>Your AI stack needs to have DevX, thus, a platform:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it’s a sign of maturity that even when you mix in cloud native development with the current AI hype, organizations are actually realizing that developers are still the internal customers who need platforms as products. You can’t just say ‘get on with it’ and hand them a box of tools,” said Daniel Bryant, head of marketing, Syntasso Ltd.'</p>

<p>Digital sovereignty is not a future trend — it’s happening now. Whether you’re in defense, finance, healthcare, or the public sector, the time to act is today. Start by assessing your tech stack, exploring sovereign cloud options, and preparing for sovereign AI-driven transformation. Don’t wait for regulations to force your hand—embrace sovereignty as a competitive advantage.</p>

<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to data presented at the summit, the AI opportunity is massive – estimated at $400 billion in revenues over the next decade, with 75% tied to applications and services. Google’s $10 billion investment in Belgium and $5.5 billion in Germany for cloud infrastructure signals a strong commitment to the region. Sovereign solutions, powered by GPUs from NVIDIA and Google TPUs, enable organizations to build locally compliant, high-performance applications. The ultimate goal? Empower businesses to focus on app development rather than infrastructure headaches.</p></blockquote> [...]<br>
