            Global memory scarcity will cause a 13 percent drop in smartphone sales in 2026, according to IDC (via <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-26/idc-sees-13-collapse-in-smartphone-market-due-to-memory-crisis">Bloomberg</a></em>). DRAM is in short supply because AI companies are buying huge quantities of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for servers in data centers, and manufacturers are prioritizing HBM instead of the memory used in consumer devices.

            <b>Published:</b> 2026-02-26 10:26:14-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            After several weeks of testing, Apple today released Xcode 26.3, an update that allows developers to use tools like Anthropic's Claude Agent and OpenAI's Codex for app creation directly in Xcode.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1035002" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/macOS-26-Xcode.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
With support for agentic coding, Xcode can complete more complex app development tasks autonomously. Apple worked with Anthropic and OpenAI to configure their agents for use in Xcode and to ensure that AI models can access a full range of Xcode features.
<br/>
<br/>
Agents are able to create new files, examine code structure of a project, build a project directly and run tests, take image snapshots to check their work, and access Apple's full, up-to-date developer documentation.
<br/>
<br/>
Along with OpenAI and Anthropic models, Xcode 26.3 is compatible with any agent or tool that uses the open standard Model Context Protocol.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has agreed to pay Samsung twice as much for the LPDDR5X memory chips that it needs for ongoing iPhone 17 production, claims a report from Korean outlet <em><a href="https://dealsite.co.kr/articles/157475">Dealsite</a></em>.

<br/>
According to the report's sources, Apple recently held emergency meetings with Samsung's semiconductor division to negotiate delivery volumes of RAM for the first half of this year. The 12GB LPDDR5X modules used in the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro have already roughly doubled in price since early 2025, rising from around $30 to approximately $70.
<br/>
<br/>
Samsung is said to have originally planned to push for a 60% price increase on LPDDR5X modules supplied to Apple. Instead, however, Samsung opened with a 100% markup as a negotiating tactic – and Apple apparently accepted it on the spot.

We expect the first beta of macOS 27 to be seeded to developers during WWDC 2026 in June, and a public beta to follow in July. Following beta testing, the update should be released to all users with a compatible Mac in September.
