<h2>iPad Pro</h2>
<br/>
Rumors suggest that Apple will update the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models before the end of the year, introducing the faster M5 chip in the device. No notable design changes are coming because last year's update brought an overhauled look, but there are a couple new features planned.
<br/>
<br/>
The ‌iPad Pro‌ looks like it will be the first to get the M5 chip, which is built on an updated 3-nanometer process. We can expect modest performance and efficiency improvements.
