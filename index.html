Apple says that links can be used for things like planning a trip, adding a gift registry, or working out who is bringing what to a potluck. Links are open ended, so any website can be added to an invite that you create.

Links are located in a new "Tiles" section in the Invites app. Tapping on "Add Tile" at the bottom of the app allows for link insertion, with users able to include the link, a link title, and a link description.
