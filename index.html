            <b>Published:</b> 2025-04-15 04:06:49-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Taiwan's China Airlines now supports Apple's iPhone feature that makes it easier to share the location of AirTag-equipped baggage at airports, according to <a href="https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/life/breakingnews/5012598">local media</a>.

<br/>
With iOS 18.2, Apple introduced a new Find My feature that lets you temporarily share the location of an AirTag-equipped item – such as a bag – with others, including participating airline staff, to help track it if it's lost or delayed.
<br/>
<br/>
Users running iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, or macOS Sequoia 15.2 and later can generate a "Share Item Location" link in the Find My app. Recipients can view the item's location on a live-updating web map.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-04-15 03:38:02-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's upcoming foldable iPhone (aka "iPhone Fold") will use OLED panels exclusively supplied by Samsung Display, reports <em><a href="https://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=239775">Business Korea</a></em>.

<br/>
Apple's decision to rely exclusively on Samsung Display is noteworthy, as it marks a departure from Apple's usual strategy of sourcing components from multiple suppliers to reduce costs and ensure consistent quality.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple's decision to use Samsung as the sole supplier of the OLED panels, leaving out LG Display and China's BOE, was reportedly down to Samsung's "technological edge in minimizing screen creases." 
<br/>
<br/>
"For Apple, which prioritizes quality over price when selecting component suppliers, Samsung was the only viable choice," stated an industry insider quo [...]<br>

<br/>
Mythic Quest starred Rob McElhenney, Charlotte Nicdao, Danny Pudi, and David Hornsby, all of whom played characters that worked at the fictional Mythic Quest Studios creating, designing, and running a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game. The show provided a satirical and humorous look at the inner workings of video game development.

<br/>
Season four was not initially meant to be the show's final season, so the season four finale has been updated with a new ending that will provide Mythic Quest fans with closure.

            <a href="https://dioconnect.com">Dio</a> is a small company focused on delivering a single product for the Apple ecosystem: a low-cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> speaker system known as <a href="https://dioconnect.com/products/dio-node">Dio Node</a>.
