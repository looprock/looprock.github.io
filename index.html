Unsurprisingly, the ‌iPhone‌ Air is indeed "Awe Dropping" at first touch just because it's so lightweight and thin in the hand despite the 6.5-inch display. Even though it's light, it still feels like a premium device, which is expected at the $999 price point. The ‌iPhone‌ Air is 5.6mm thick, which makes it the thinnest ‌iPhone‌ to date, and it weighs 165 grams.

            The thin and light <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Air does not have a physical SIM slot, and is limited to eSIM-only operation. That's something of a problem, because in China, carriers have not traditionally supported eSIM for the ‌iPhone‌ even though it's widely used around the world.

Until now, iPhones sold in China have always had a physical SIM slot, and that's still the case for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-09 13:39:34-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Apple Watch Series 11 features the device's first ever decisive battery life increase, reaching a full 24-hours.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1017825" height="898" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/series-11.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
Since the Apple Watch was first unveiled in 2014, it has featured what Apple called an "all-day" 18-hour battery life through each successive generation until now. With the Series 11, battery life reaches 24 hours. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> 3 continues to feature an 18-hour battery life.
<br/>
<br/>
This significant increase comes despite the Apple Watch Series 11 featuring the same casing and chip as the Series 10, so it is not entirely clear where efficiency savings or changes have been made to obtain a longer battery life.
<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Series 11 also supports fast charging, with just 15 minutes providing up to eight hours of battery life. [...]<br>
