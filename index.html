            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            A Brazilian federal court has overturned an antitrust ruling that would have required Apple to allow third-party payment systems in the App Store within 20 days.

<br/>
The initial ruling, issued on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/26/brazil-apple-lift-third-party-app-payment-limits/">November 26</a>, came in response to a 2022 complaint from Latin American e-commerce platform MercadoLibre. The regulator had ordered Apple to remove restrictions on alternative payment systems and allow developers to market different payment options for in-app purchases, threatening daily fines of $43,000 for non-compliance.
<br/>
<br/>
But Judge Eduardo Santos da Rocha Penteado of the 14th Federal Civil Court on Thursday called the original decision by Brazil's competition regulator (Cade) "disproportionate and unnecessary."

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-12-05 11:08:13-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In watchOS 11.2, Apple has added a useful new feature that's designed to allow you to pause video that you're recording on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> using the Camera Remote app on the Apple Watch. 
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The Camera Remote app has been available since the Apple Watch initially launched, and while there was an option to start and stop video recording, there wasn't an option to pause video and restart it. When a video recording is in progress, there is now a pause button on the left side of the Camera Remote interface. Tapping it pauses a video, and then tapping the red record button restarts the video.

Apple initially added a feature for pausing video recordings with the ‌iPhone‌ Camera app in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, and the  [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-12-05 10:43:56-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the visionOS 2.2 update that's set to come out next week, Apple is introducing the promised Multiview feature that will let sports fans watch up to five games at once.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955609" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/visionOS-2-on-Apple-Vision-Pro-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
The Multiview feature for the Vision Pro works with MLS and MLB games, but other sports like football and hockey are not supported at this time. Apple offers MLS and MLB games through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+ subscription service because it has partnerships with those leagues. 
<br/>
<br/>
The update adds SharePlay integration so that Vision Pro wearers can view live sporting events together, including multiple games at the same time.

Along with the new Multiview and SharePlay features, visionOS 2.2 introduces two new Mac Virtual Display aspect ratios, including 21:9 (wi [...]<br>
