One thing worth noting is that Apple is reportedly planning a major change to its iPhone release cycle this year, adopting a two-phase rollout starting with the iPhone 18 series. That means the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and iPhone Fold will be released in September 2026, followed by the iPhone 18 and iPhone 18e in spring 2027.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26.4, Apple added an Average Bedtime metric to the Sleep section of the Health app, letting users better monitor how bedtime impacts sleep quality.
<br/>

<br/>
Under a new Sleep Highlight, Apple lists the time that you went to bed and the time that you usually go to bed based on averages over a two-week period.
<br/>
<br/>
In iOS 26.3, Apple displayed average sleep time over the past seven days. That highlight still exists, but it is now supplemented with the daily bedtime readout.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple also updated the Vitals readout in the U.S., and it once again lists blood oxygen level on the line graph overview that's available each day. In iOS 26.3 and earlier versions of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, there was a section for the blood oxygen level, but the graph did not include a b [...]<br>

            <p>Your Boss Doesn’t Know What to Do With AI</p>
<p>Enterprise AI Has a Product-Market Fit Problem. Enterprise AI isn’t stalled because the models are weak. It’s stalled because we haven’t discovered product-market fit inside the enterprise yet.</p>
<p>You don’t find real AI value by theorizing in workshops. You find it by running experiments for months inside your actual systems - against real data - in a governed environment.</p>
<p>That requires a platform.</p>
<p>Without one, AI pilots turn into disconnected experiments, shadow infrastructure, and compliance risk. With one, experimentation compounds into institutional learning.</p>

            <b>Published:</b> 2026-02-16 00:00:00+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Iteration has long been one of the more fragmented areas of Go, with developers relying on ad hoc patterns to traverse custom data structures. This article explores the range-over-functions experiment, a proposed evolution of the language that introduces a standardized iterator model while preserving Go&rsquo;s familiar for range syntax. Using the new iter package and sequence abstractions, it shows how iteration logic can be expressed more clearly, flexibly, and idiomatically. Originally published in April 2024, the concepts remain highly relevant as Go continues to evolve toward more expressive yet simple language features.</p><br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Internal development teams and executives are increasingly looking at AI to automate the creation of internal developer platforms. However, cobbling together open-source components with AI is a far cry from building a scalable, secure, and &ldquo;enterprise-grade&rdquo; environment. In this conversation, we explore why betting your internal infrastructure on AI-generated platforms is a high-stakes risk and why human-led architecture still dictates the long-term success of a platform.</p>
