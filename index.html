            While the focus is now on iOS 26, there is still an iOS 18.6 update incoming.

<br/>
As noted <a href="https://x.com/zollotech/status/1948171482674155850">by Aaron Zollo</a>, Apple on Wednesday re-labeled iOS 18.6 Beta 4 as simply iOS 18.6, meaning that it is the Release Candidate version. This change effectively confirms that the update will be released to the public next week.
<br/>
<br/>
Alongside the new label, Apple shared release notes for iOS 18.6, which is a minor update focused on bug fixes and security patches. One of the fixes is for an issue that prevented sharing <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/guide/iphone/iph1a5832438/ios">memory movies</a> in the Photos app, according to Apple.
