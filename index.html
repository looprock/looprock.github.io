            In iOS 17, Apple doesn't offer a system-level method for individually locking sensitive apps like Photos behind Face ID. There is a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/automatically-lock-iphone-app-opened/">Shortcut action</a> that provides rudimentary protection, but it's not infallible. Thankfully, iOS 18 includes a dedicated option to lock and even hide individual apps even when the iPhone itself is already unlocked.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In 2025, Apple is expected to discontinue the iPhone "Plus" device in its iPhone 17 lineup to make way for an iPhone "Air" – although it may not actually be called this when the device debuts in the fall of next year. Even though the iPhone 16 series has only just launched, when you consider that we learned about larger displays on the iPhone 16 Pro models way back in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/">May 2023</a>, rumors about a next-generation iPhone aren't all that unusual so far ahead of time.
