Apple announced its foray into original video content in 2019 with the launch of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+, positioning the service as a curated platform for high-quality, original programming. Since then, the company has invested billions of dollars in films and series, drawing in top-tier talent including Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese, and Cate Blanchett. However, the service has yet to produce a breakout theatrical success or significantly impact the broader streaming landscape in terms of subscriber volume.

            WhatsApp is making it easier to catch up on conversations you've missed with a new AI-powered feature that summarizes unread messages. The Meta-owned messaging app now lets users tap on unread message counts to "Summarize privately" and get quick, bulleted summaries generated by Meta AI instead of scrolling through every individual message.

<br/>
The feature uses Meta's "Private Processing" technology, which the company <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/catch-up-on-conversations-with-private-message-summaries">claims</a> keeps your messages and summaries completely private – even Meta and WhatsApp staff can't see them.

According to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchos-release-notes/watchos-26-release-notes">Apple's release notes</a> for the update, the beta causes the Apple Watch Hermès to crash continually. Apple says that Hermès Apple Watch owners should not update to beta 2 at this time.

Installing ‌watchOS 26‌ on a Hermès Apple Watch causes the watch to overheat, crash continually, and fail to charge, based on reports. It appears to be the Hermès Apple Watch face that is an issue.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If you own an iPhone or iPad with a USB-C port, the port can be used to charge AirPods, an Apple Watch, or even another iPhone, which is handy for times when you don't have a spare charger or power outlet available. Here's how it works.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910412" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-USB-C-Port-Event-Still.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
If your AirPods or Apple Watch run out of battery while you don't have access to a charger, you can use the battery in your iPhone or iPad for a little extra juice rather than carrying around an additional battery pack.
<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, if you plug an ‌iPhone 15‌ or newer into another ‌iPhone 15‌ or newer, the two devices will communicate with one another, determine which ‌iPhone‌ has the lower battery, and transfer power in the direction that needs it most.
