            <b>Published:</b> 2023-06-28 21:34:03+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Despite Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) designed to mirror certain aspects of human cognition, they've been surpassed by Transformers in Natural Language Processing tasks. The primary reasons include RNNs' issues with the vanishing gradient problem, difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies, and training inefficiencies. The hypothesis that larger RNNs could mitigate these issues falls short in practice due to computational inefficiencies and memory constraints. On the other hand, Transformers leverage their parallel processing ability and self-attention mechanism to efficiently handle sequences and train larger models. Thus, the evolution of AI architectures is driven not only by biological plausibility but also by practical considerations such as computational efficiency and scalability.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Turing completeness is a concept in computer science that refers to a system or language's ability to simulate a**Turing machine**. Being Turing complete means having the tools necessary to tackle multiple tasks as long as the instructions are provided. Bitcoin is not considered Turing complete because its scripting language is intentionally designed to be limited in functionality.<br>

In <a href="https://doordash.news/merchant/introducing-doordashs-biggest-app-updates-in-a-decade/">an announcement on Wednesday</a>, DoorDash says it will start giving couriers the ability to earn hourly rates on top of tips.</p>
<p id="naKkyu">With the update, couriers will now see the option to “earn by time,” which offers a guaranteed hourly minimum rate for the time they spend on making deliveries. According to DoorDash, the clock starts as soon as a courier accepts an order and ends when it’s dropped off. </p>
