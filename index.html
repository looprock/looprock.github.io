            Thailand's Pheu Thai Party plans to give citizens aged 16 and older a $280 handout to stimulate the economy. The funds can be spent only within four kilometers of their homes and expire after six months. The program involves sending the handout to digital wallets of eligible citizens. This resembles a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) due to blockchain technology and programmability, including geolocation-based restrictions and expiry dates. While over 100 central banks explore programmable CBDCs, Thailand's Bank of Thailand is still in the trial stage. This scheme could lay the foundation for a future digital ID-based CBDC. Similar programmable CBDC concepts have been discussed at high-level meetings and conferences.<br>

            <p><em>Anna Apostol, co-founder of Mate Academy, an online coding boot camp.</em></p>
<p>\
<strong>Too emotional, often irrational, dependent, and potentially pregnant — this is how female entrepreneurs can still be perceived in the business community. Even when these stereotypes aren’t vocalized, they can make it harder for women to succeed in the startup world.</strong></p>
<p>\
“When my husband told his friend that I worked with him at a startup, he replied that he also had found a ‘warm place’ for a wife in his own company. But the thing is, no one had put me in a startup — I co-founded it,” says Anna Apostol, co-founder of <strong><a href="https://mate.academy/en">Mate Academy</a></strong>, an online coding boot camp.</p>

Anna’s story isn’t unique: Gender parity in the startup world remains a critical issue. Discrimination, societal expectations, stereotypes, and unequal access to funding are among the key reasons why entrepreneurship is still considered to be a male-dominated field.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple will begin receiving mass shipments of the iPhone 15 Pro Max this week, according to information shared today <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/apple-could-see-a-rebound-in-its-stock-price-ahead-of-new-product-announcements-in-september-and-49863c2233d5">by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. This suggests that the iPhone 15 Pro Max will be available in September, despite concerns over a production delay, but customers might need to order one quickly if they want launch-day delivery.

            <h1>Don’t get hung up on “customer value” and “business value”</h1><p>I feel like this metaphor of “customer value” (and “business value”) has gone too far. It’s become something that people think is real, not just metaphor.</p><p>Instead of “value” what we’re talking about is something like “is useful at a price the customer will pay.” Jobs to Be Done theory feels a lot closer to real.</p><p>The other issue: there are not ROI spreadsheets for a lot of things in our personal lives.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Viewed together, three main facts indicate that Microsoft enjoys monopoly power. First, Microsoft’s share of the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems is extremely large and stable. Second, Microsoft’s dominant market share is protected by a high barrier to entry. Third, and largely as a result of that barrier, Microsoft’s customers lack a commercially viable alternative to Windows.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Just a few weeks ahead of Apple unveiling new iPhones, rumors continue to circulate about new color options for the devices. The latest information comes from established leakers <a href="https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1696145808196780032">@MajinBuOfficial</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/URedditor/status/1696146103547146555">@URedditor</a>, who today said the lower-end iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models will be available in a new light green finish.

<br/>
@MajinBuOfficial said it appears the new color option will be very similar to the green finish available for the iPhone 12 and the discontinued iPhone 12 mini. However, the leaker is unsure if the color will be available when the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus launch in September, or introduced as an additional color option in spring 2024.
