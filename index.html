            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-31 16:35:06-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is preparing to release iOS 18.7 for compatible iPhone models, according to evidence of the update in the <em>MacRumors</em> visitor logs.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984198" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/iOS-18-on-iPhone-Arrow-Down.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
We expect iOS 18.7 to be released in September, alongside iOS 26. The update will likely include fixes for security vulnerabilities, but little else.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.7 will be one of the final updates ever released for the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR, as those devices are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/ios-26-supports-iphone-11-and-newer/">not compatible with iOS 26</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26 is compatible with the iPhone 11 and newer.
<br/>
<br/>
Following months of beta testing, iOS 26 is finally nearing a release, with the update likely to be made available to the general public around the middle of September.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When people use the term “Orwellian,” it’s not a good sign.

            The court order that required Apple to collect no fees from developers who link to purchases outside of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> is unconstitutional, Apple said today in a reply brief directed at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> and filed with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Apple argues that it has been stripped of its rights to be compensated for its intellectual property in a ruling that sets a dangerous precedent for all companies.

<br/>
Last year, Apple chose soft, pastel-inspired finishes for its iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus models. They are available in ultramarine, teal, pink, white, and black. The yellow that the iPhone 15 comes in is notably missing, having been replaced by the darker blue hue of the ultramarine. Together, the iPhone 16 colors appear more saturated and vivid – pink and ultramarine especially show a bolder, more confident hue compared to the pastel washes of the iPhone 15.
