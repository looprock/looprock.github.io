            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is exploring multispectral imaging technology for future iPhone cameras that could improve Visual Intelligence, enhance material detection, and boost image processing, according to a new supply chain rumor out of China.

In a <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/5252407685546916">post on Weibo</a>, leaker Digital Chat Station said Apple is currently evaluating components related to multispectral imaging within the supply chain, but cautioned that formal testing has not yet begun, suggesting the technology remains at an exploratory stage.

Multispectral imaging differs from traditional smartphone photography, which relies solely on standard red, green, and blue light. Instead, the technology captures image data across multiple, distinct wavelength bands, which can add sensitivity to near-infrared or o [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's adoption of a 200-megapixel camera for a future iPhone is still some ways off, according to a prominent supply chain leaker who says such a sensor is not currently part of Apple's active prototype testing.

In a <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/5252407685546916">post on Weibo</a>, Chinese leaker Digital Chat Station said that 200-megapixel camera sensors are being discussed in the supply chain, but they have not appeared in iPhone engineering prototypes undergoing real-world imaging tests. Instead, Apple's current camera development work is said to remain focused on refining 48-megapixel systems, as per previous reports.

CI/CD pipelines, runbooks, chatbots and DevOps tooling were supposed to mean reduced tickets, fewer incidents and fewer 3 a.m. pages. Instead, operational load has exploded. Systems are more distributed, dependencies are more tangled and customer expectations are less forgiving.  What’s changed recently [&#8230;]<br>

            At <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2026/">CES 2026</a>, Google announced <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-tv/ces-2026/">some new Gemini features</a> that it's bringing to Google TVs. Google TV is built into some TV sets and set-top boxes, and while it may not be immediately relevant to many Apple users, it does give us a look at what AI can do on a TV set.

<br/>
The AI robot has a rolling base, a tube-shaped body, and flexible arms. SwitchBot says that it is designed to learn, adapt, and work in coordination with existing SwitchBot robots like vacuums. It does not have a single function, and is instead meant to adapt to multiple cleaning scenarios.

            Senso is a gamified plant sensor that's designed to use AI to improve plant care. It is supposed to track soil moisture, temperature, and light exposure data in real time, and there is a little pixel creature that delivers AI insights.

The pixel creature awakens once the sensor is placed in soil, and users can complete daily and weekly plant care missions to collect rewards and unlock new characters. The sensor has a modular design with different depth options, and multiple sensors for multiple plants can be combined. The AI and an accompanying app are meant to adapt to provide accurate readings across different plant species and pot types.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has historically resisted the idea of touchscreen MacBooks, arguing that laptop PCs with the feature are unwieldy and far from ergonomic. But recent reports suggest Apple has changed its tune, and the company is now rumored to be developing a touchscreen MacBook Pro. In the meantime, startup <a href="https://intricuit.com">Intricuit</a> has been showcasing its own solution at CES 2026 that brings touchscreen functionality to existing MacBooks with Apple silicon.

            <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31283667"><em>Stubborn Attachments</em></a> is a weird book. Perhaps because it was published in 2018 it has an out of time agenda that no longer seems to need arguing for. The book obsesses over a “we can all agree on cheese” argument: it’s desirable to be more prosperous in the future than today.</p>
<p>We can all agree that given the option of being worse off or better off tomorrow, the next week, or even in 100 years, that we would like to be better off.</p>
<p>This leads to a link that we need money and growth to fund prosperity in the future. Compound Interest is magic, so whatever you can spare to invest in today in worth it.</p>
<p>Cowen then say, “yes, but we should not do immoral things to get there.” What are the immoral things? They are almost ten commandment level obvious: killing people, slavery. Coveting your neighbor’s romantic interests is not covered.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Employees think working from home is fine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hybrid work has moved from novelty to normality, but employers and employees are no longer aligned on what it should look like. More than half of employees (56%) now work in the office full-time, yet only 15% would choose this pattern, with three-quarters (75%) preferring a more balanced approach.</p>
<p>This widening gap signals that organizations face a choice: continue to rely on presence-led models or shift toward purpose-led ones. Presence-led approaches treat attendance as a stand-in for productivity, yet many employees question the value of being on site when work can be completed just as effectively elsewhere. This is reinforced by over 80% of respondents saying that their employer is already well equipped for hybrid working, and by the fact that the main advantages of office time are relationship-driven rather than operational.</p>
