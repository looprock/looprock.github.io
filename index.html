<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Though the game was first released in 2022, it has been limited to Windows machines and PlayStation consoles until today.
<br/>
<br/>
In this third-person adventure title, a stray cat's curiosity causes him to get stuck in a walled city filled with robots and mutant bacteria, and the aim in the game is to get back up to the surface using B-12, the cat's drone companion.
<br/>
<br/>
Stray asks players to solve puzzles, bypass obstacles, and complete quests while avoiding security bots and evil bacteria. The game is platform-based, so players will need to climb up various obstacles and interact with the environment to open up new pathways.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-12-05 14:00:00-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today added the original <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> to its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624">vintage and obsolete products list</a>. The first version of the ‌iPhone SE‌ came out in March 2016, which means it has been seven years since it launched.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925333" height="844" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iphone-se-2016.jpg" width="1500"/>
<br/>
The ‌iPhone SE‌ was sold until September 2018, so it has been five years since it was last available for sale, making it eligible for Apple's vintage designation. Products are marked as vintage five years after the device was last sold by Apple, while products are marked as obsolete at the seven year point.
<br/>
<br/>
Vintage devices are not guaranteed to be eligible for repairs through Apple or Apple Authorized Service Providers, though Apple will offer repairs if the parts are available.
