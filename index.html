            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 19 is still around three months away from being unveiled, but there are plenty of rumors about the upcoming update.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979789" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iOS-19-Roundup-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Below, we recap iOS 19 rumors so far.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Redesigned Camera App</h2>
<br/>
A leak earlier this year allegedly revealed a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/ios-19-redesigned-camera-app-visionos-rumor/">redesigned Camera app coming with iOS 19</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
On his YouTube channel Front Page Tech in January, Jon Prosser <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaP_q9W3AQE">shared a video</a> showing what the new Camera app will apparently look like, with the key change being translucent menus for camera controls. Overall, the design of these menus looks similar to visionOS, the software platform for Apple's Vision Pro headset.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-01 10:00:00-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Apple offered a line of Wi-Fi routers that it referred to as AirPort base stations. There was a standard AirPort Express, a higher-end AirPort Extreme with more advanced networking features, and an AirPort Time Capsule that doubled as an external storage drive for backing up a Mac with Time Machine.

            During peak COVID lockdowns, New York State passed a law requiring that ISPs (with more than 20,000 subscribers) offer low-income state residents (and low income residents only) a 25 Mbps broadband tier for $15. Big Telecom didn’t much like that, but their multi-year effort to kill the law, first passed in 2021, recently fell apart [&#8230;]<br>

While the C1 does not support ultra-fast mmWave 5G in the U.S., it appears to offer comparable 5G performance to Qualcomm's Snapdragon X71 modem found in the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max.

            Microsoft today announced that it will officially retire Skype on May 5, 2025, concluding its 14-year tenure as the owner of the once-dominant internet calling and messaging service (via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-28/microsoft-msft-to-shut-down-skype-as-zoom-teams-dominate-video-calls"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>).

Microsoft acquired Skype in 2011 for $8.5 billion in what was then its largest-ever acquisition. At its peak, Skype had more than 300 million monthly active users and was synonymous with internet-based voice and video calling.

            Apple's new entry-level iPhone 16e has inherited the Action button first seen on the iPhone 15 Pro and now found on all iPhone 16 models.

The Action button replaces the single-function switch used to toggle between ring and silent, offering additional options so users can choose between quickly accessing the camera or flashlight, activate Voice Memos, Focus modes, Translate, and accessibility features like Magnifier.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has offered a reason why the iPhone 16e doesn't include MagSafe, one of the more notable omissions from its latest entry-level smartphone.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-992294" height="1100" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iphone-16e-usb-c-feature.jpg" width="1956"/>
<br/>
According to Apple representatives who spoke to <em><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/the_iphone_16e">Daring Fireball</a></em>'s John Gruber, MagSafe is not included in the iPhone 16e because "most people in the iPhone 16e's target audience exclusively charge their phones by plugging them into a charging cable."
<br/>
<br/>
These users apparently tend not to use wireless charging at all, and when they do use it, Apple believes the slower 7.5W Qi charging speed compared to MagSafe's faster rates isn't a deciding factor for the customer segment it is targeting with the more affordable device.

Introduced with the iPhone 12 lineup in 2020, MagSafe uses ma [...]<br>

<p>Yes, <strong>“working people”</strong> is a shibboleth in U.S. political discourse, particularly among progressive and labor-oriented politicians. It’s often used as a way to signal alignment with <strong>workers, unions, and the middle or lower class</strong> without explicitly saying “working class,” which can carry more rigid or ideological connotations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>On the left</strong>, Democrats and labor advocates frequently use “working people” to emphasize economic struggles and the need for policies like higher wages, healthcare, and workers' rights. Figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and union leaders use it to frame their rhetoric around economic justice.</p>

<p><strong>On the right</strong>, populist conservatives sometimes use “working people” to position themselves against “elites” or “coastal liberals,” though they tend to favor phrases like &amp;ldq</p></li></ul> [...]<br>
