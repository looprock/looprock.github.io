            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's divisive new Liquid Glass design language in iOS 26 could be hinting at a major hardware redesign coming to future iPhones, reckons veteran app developer Craig Hockenberry of The Iconfactory.

<br/>

<br/>
In a blog post published this week titled "<a href="https://furbo.org/2025/08/17/liquid-glass-why/">Liquid Glass. Why?</a>", Hockenberry argues that unlike the transition from iOS 6 to iOS 7, which addressed a genuine need for simplified interfaces, no one outside Apple was clamoring for "more fluid glass in our designs." 
<br/>
<br/>
Recalling Apple's unveiling of Liquid Glass during WWDC, the developer reflects:

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-18 09:25:13-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is preparing to release another minor iOS 18 update for the iPhone, according to information shared by an anonymous leaker today in a post on X. The leaker has a private account, and they request that we do not link to their posts, but they have proven to be a reliable source for upcoming iOS versions.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984198" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/iOS-18-on-iPhone-Arrow-Down.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Specifically, the leaker said they have seen evidence of iOS 18.6.2 with a build number of 22G100. However, in a private message, they said it is possible that the update will simply end up being a revised version of iOS 18.6.1.
<br/>
<br/>
A similar situation played out last year, when the leaker <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/apple-preparing-ios-17-5-2/">said iOS 17.5.2 was in the pipeline</a>, but Apple ended up releasing a  [...]<br>

<br/>
The cash-back offer is also available at qualifying ChargePoint stations for electric vehicles.

<br/>
5% Daily Cash is limited to $500 in combined Exxon, Mobil, and ChargePoint purchases, meaning that the maximum cash back you can receive from this offer is $25.
