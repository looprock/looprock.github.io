In a one-hour conversation with Stripe co-founder Patrick Collison, Ive reflected on the personal and professional experiences that have shaped his career, beginning with his early exposure to Apple products as a student in the UK. Recalling his first encounter with the original Macintosh, Ive described it as a transformative moment that revealed the values of its creators.

"What we make stands testament to who we are," he said. He characterized the Mac as a "bicycle for the mind," a phrase popularized by Steve Jobs, and noted how it inspired his eventual relocation to California in the early 1990s.

            The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) has released <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/delivering-on-the-bi-annual-release-schedule-bluetooth-core-6-1-is-here/">Bluetooth 6.1</a> as part of its new bi-annual update schedule. The update introduces Randomized Resolvable Private Address (RPA), a feature designed to enhance both privacy and power efficiency.

<br/>
This new feature makes tracking Bluetooth devices a lot more difficult because it randomizes the timing of device address changes, instead of just using predictable intervals. It also offloads address change operations to the controller device, which should help extend the battery life of the accessory device.

            Apple today shared a new spatial video that's designed to highlight the Vision Pro headset, demonstrating how the device can be used to make and preserve memories.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
For the video, two parents, Sam and Khulan, filmed their newborn son using iPhones that are capable of recording spatial video. Sam then edited the footage into a home video for Khulan to watch on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, and the video shows Khulan's reaction to seeing the montage.
