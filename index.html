            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            To ensure secure communication over the public internet, JayP needs to address authentication, confidentiality, and integrity concerns. Digital certificates play a vital role in solving these issues. They verify the identity of websites like YouTube and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks by confirming the source of the public key. Certificate Authorities (CAs) sign digital certificates, creating a chain of trust. Operating systems include trusted root CAs, and websites obtain intermediate certificates from CAs. The browser verifies certificates' authenticity through hashing and decryption, ensuring secure connections. Three types of TLS certificates are explained: Single Domain (for one specific domain), Wildcard (for main domain and subdomains), and Multi-Domain (SAN, for multiple unrelated domains in one certificate).<br>

<br/>
The sixth version builds on Goodnotes 5's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> handwriting recognition by adding AI-powered Spellcheck, which draws heavily  on the neural engine in Apple silicon to recognize mistakes in writing and suggest a correction or rewrite the word in the user's handwriting style. 
<br/>
<br/>
Currently, the spellcheck feature supports English, Spanish, German and Dutch. GoodNotes 6 also introduces an experimental word autocomplete feature for handwriting in English.

            It was earnings season these past few weeks, which meant each of your favorite (or unfavorite!) tech companies told shareholders how much money they made in the preceding quarter and by all accounts, results were.. largely good?

Except for Apple, whose stock took a bit of a beating because the company failed to sell as many iPhones as shareholders would have liked. Now, if you were to look at the company's financial results, its sales were down by 1% year-over-year, which doesn't sound like a lot — until you realize that at the scale of Apple, 1% in monetary terms is literally a billion dollars.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Did class distinctions play a role in determining the fate of those onboard, creating a divide between privilege and danger? How did age and gender influence who survived and who succumbed to the relentless sea? Amidst the chaos, did the presence of family members provide comfort and support, urging passengers to face the storm together? And did the port of embarkation influence the destinies of those who boarded from different locations?

Thankfully, we can answer these questions using the Titanic dataset available at Kaggle. More than a hundred years after it sank, we can use the data to understand how a ticket's price may have influenced survival and whether certain cabin locations provided refuge during the tragic events. This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will reveal insights into the passengers’ experiences, shedding light on their stories of courage and loss on that fateful night.<br>
