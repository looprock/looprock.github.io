            In a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213935">support document</a> published online today, Apple detailed using its Vision Pro headset with certain medical conditions.
<br/>

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922614" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Apple-WWCD23-Vision-Pro-EyeSight-230605.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
Apple says customers with pre-existing medical conditions should consult with a healthcare provider before using the Vision Pro, as using the headset could "aggravate symptoms or increase the risk of injury or discomfort."
<br/>
<br/>
Apple says these medical conditions include:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>Heart conditions</li>
<br/>
<li>Migraines or chronic headaches</li>
<br/>
<li>Dizziness or vertigo</li>
<br/>
<li>Eye or vision conditions, such as binocular vision conditions</li>
<br/>
<li>Psychological conditions</li>
<br/>
<li>Inner ear conditions</li>

<li>History of dry eyes, itchiness, or swelling of the eyelid</li></ul> [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-01-19 11:09:56-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Vision Pro features an aluminum frame that houses a single piece of laminated glass for the front of the device, and as we've learned from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, glass is quite breakable. If the Vision Pro's glass cracks or the device is damaged in some other way, you could be facing an expensive repair without <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a>+.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
On <a href="https://support.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/repair">Apple's Vision Pro service page</a>, repair fees are listed. It will cost $799 to fix cracked cover glass, but if you need any other component repaired, the cost shoots up to $2,399. That's just $1,100 less than the full cost of the Vision Pro to begin with.

Apple says that the Vision Pro specifically weighs between 21.2 and 22.9 ounces (600 and 650 grams) depending on which Light Seal and head band is used on the device.

Custom wording of the customer's choice can be engraved into the black plastic sides of the optional ZEISS lens inserts designed for those who normally wear glasses or contact lenses. The option is probably intended to help multiple users identify which lens inserts belong to them, rather than be a novel way to personalize the device, since they are very small and there is no other engraving option for the Vision Pro.
