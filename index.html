            Apple has become the target of a £785 million ($1 billion) class action lawsuit on behalf of over 1,500 developers in the UK over its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> fees, reports <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/24/apple-targeted-in-app-store-antitrust-damages-suit-thats-seeking-1bn-for-uk-developers/">TechCrunch</a></em>.

The suit accuses Apple of abusing a dominant position by charging a 15% to 30% fee on in-app sales in the ‌App Store‌, a policy that has been criticized by antitrust regulators in other countries.

It also argues UK consumers are missing out because developers are being deprived of money that could be spent on research and development to help drive app innovation.
