<br/>
In this scenario, Apple can't just reset your password for you, especially if your have two-factor authentication enabled. Setting up a recovery key is one alternative solution, but in such cases you can't change your password unless you have a trusted second device as well as the recovery key.

In an effort to make things easier, Apple allows you to set up an account recovery contact that can help make sure you always have access to your account, even if you forget your Apple Account password or device passcode. Your recovery contact is someone who can verify your i [...]<br>

Below, we recap rumors about the iPhone 17 Air's battery life.

<br/>
Last week, <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma said the iPhone 17 Air will have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-17-air-battery-case-report/">"worse" battery life compared to previous iPhone models</a>. In internal testing, Apple determined that the percentage of users who will be able to use the iPhone 17 Air for a full day on a single charge will be between 60% and 70%, according to his reporting. For other iPhone models, the report said that this metric falls between 80% and 90%.

            Apple's former Chief Design Officer Jony Ive has given a rare and wide-ranging interview at Stripe Sessions 2025, offering new insights into his design philosophy, his time at Apple, and his current work at his design collective, LoveFrom.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
<br/>
In a one-hour conversation with Stripe co-founder Patrick Collison, Ive reflected on the personal and professional experiences that have shaped his career, beginning with his early exposure to Apple products as a student in the UK. Recalling his first encounter with the original Macintosh, Ive described it as a transformative moment that revealed the values of its creators.
<br/>
<br/>
"What we make stands testament to who we are," he said. He characterized the Mac as a "bicycle for the mind," a phrase popularized by Steve Jobs, and noted how it inspired his eventual relocation to California in the early 1990s.

            The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) has released <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/delivering-on-the-bi-annual-release-schedule-bluetooth-core-6-1-is-here/">Bluetooth 6.1</a> as part of its new bi-annual update schedule. The update introduces Randomized Resolvable Private Address (RPA), a feature designed to enhance both privacy and power efficiency.

<br/>
This new feature makes tracking Bluetooth devices a lot more difficult because it randomizes the timing of device address changes, instead of just using predictable intervals. It also offloads address change operations to the controller device, which should help extend the battery life of the accessory device.
<br/>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today shared a new spatial video that's designed to highlight the Vision Pro headset, demonstrating how the device can be used to make and preserve memories.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
For the video, two parents, Sam and Khulan, filmed their newborn son using iPhones that are capable of recording spatial video. Sam then edited the footage into a home video for Khulan to watch on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, and the video shows Khulan's reaction to seeing the montage.
