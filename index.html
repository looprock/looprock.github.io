Apple calls the button the Capture Button internally, and it is going to be one of the most advanced buttons that's been introduced to date with support for multiple gestures and the ability to respond to pressure. Here's everything the button will be able to do, according to rumors:

            When introducing the new Pixel 9 models today, Google didn't miss an opportunity to denigrate Apple Intelligence. All of the new Pixel 9 devices are integrated with Google's AI technology, Gemini, and there are a host of new AI features that Google introduced.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Like Apple Intelligence, Gemini works using on-device processing power, but Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-pixel-9-new-ai-features/#pixel9phones">made sure to point out</a> that Gemini is capable enough to answer complex queries without handing a task off to another AI service. The comment was a dig at Apple's plan to add ChatGPT integration to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, as ChatGPT will be able to do things that ‌Siri‌ can't. From Google:

The wallpapers feature the sequoia trees that ‌macOS Sequoia‌ is named for. The imagery likely comes from Sequoia National Park, located in the southern Sierra Nevada mountains of California. There are three separate versions of the wallpaper for different times of day: Sequoia Sunrise, Sequoia Morning, and Sequoia Night.
<br/>
<br/>
Each wallpaper is animated and will shift slightly at the Lock Screen when you unlock your Mac, plus there is an option to set it as a screen saver.
