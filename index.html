            <b>Published:</b> 2024-02-09 08:32:26-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 will feature visionOS-inspired design elements, according to a rumor shared this week by <a href="https://theverifier.co.il/62189/exclusive-apple-ios-18-visionos/">Israeli website <em>The Verifier</em></a>.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935810" height="1012" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/visionOS-design.jpeg" width="1800"/>
<br/>
For example, the report claims that the Apple TV app on iPadOS 18 will feature the same translucent navigation bar that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/apple-tv-app-redesign-tvos-17-2/">introduced in the tvOS 17.2 version of the app</a> last year. The design of this menu draws similarities to visionOS, the operating system that runs on Apple's new Vision Pro headset, which launched in the U.S. last week.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple also plans to redesign various other system menus and built-in apps on iOS 18, including Safari, according to the report.
