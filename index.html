"Shared feeds are a new way for you to connect with people around similar interests and find profiles and conversations that are relevant to you," said the Meta-owned company in a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/02/share-custom-feeds-on-threads/">newsroom post</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
The change means that users will be able to explore public feeds under a new Feeds tab on profiles, and pin feeds they like for quick access to their favorite people and topics.
<br/>
<br/>
Before custom feeds can be shared, they must be made public. This can be done by tapping and holding a feed, selecting "Edit feeds," and then toggling on the switch next to "Public feed."

<br/>
Users can now send voice messages or upload images directly in their WhatsApp conversations with the AI assistant, said OpenAI in a <a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1886966048970478016">post on Twitter (X)</a>, although ChatGPT will continue to respond exclusively to WhatsApp users through text.

To access ChatGPT on WhatsApp, you'll need to add the number 1-800-CHAT-GPT (1-800-242-8478) to your contacts. The service then functions similarly to the web-based ChatGPT, but with the convenience of the WhatsApp interface.
