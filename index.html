<br/>
A week ago, Apple invited selected journalists and content creators to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/apple-announces-special-event-in-new-york/">"Apple Experience" in New York, London, and Shanghai</a> on Wednesday, March 4 at 9 a.m. Eastern Time.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The special new color that Apple is considering for the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max this year is red, according <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-22/apple-s-ai-wearables-push-what-to-expect-from-march-4-low-end-macbook-launch">to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

<br/>
Specifically, he said that Apple is testing a "deep red" finish for the two devices.
<br/>
<br/>
If this rumor materializes, it would be the first time that the Pro and Pro Max models ever come in red, and the iPhone 18 Pro models would be the first iPhone models to be available in red since the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-continues-to-abandon-productred/">(PRODUCT)RED</a>. However, it sounds like it would be more of a burgundy finish than a bright red.

            <b>Published:</b> 2026-02-22 10:22:00+01:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Most organizations treat infrastructure as a series of projects to be &ldquo;completed,&rdquo; but successful platform engineering requires a permanent product mindset. In this episode, we explore why platform teams need dedicated product management to balance competing priorities—like security, cost, and developer experience—and why the &ldquo;why&rdquo; scales much better than the &ldquo;what&rdquo; in large enterprises. We also dive into the often-overlooked role of designers in creating platform tools that developers actually want to use.</p>
<p>Tanzu Catsup is a weekly conversation about platform engineering, cloud-native operations, and building software in large organizations. We follow the work wherever it actually leads.</p>
