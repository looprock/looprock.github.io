Apple has seemingly been on a years-long quest to slim down the bezels on its iPhone models until they vanish out of sight, but it looks like the first "zero-bezel" iPhone is still a few years away yet. According to Korean-language outlet <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=31956">The Elec</a></em>, Apple has been working with Samsung Display and LG Display to develop the revolutionary screen technology, but the work has hit snags.

<br/>
iOS 19 will introduce a "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/21/apple-llm-siri-2026/">more conversational Siri</a>" powered by "more advanced large language models," according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.

<br/>
Kuo expects the standard M5 chip to enter mass production in the first half of 2025, followed by the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips in the second half of the year. Then, he expects the M5 Ultra chip to enter mass production in 2026.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            This year, Apple tweaked iPhone 16 Pro screen sizes to make them bigger than 2023's iPhone 15 Pro models, and next year we are also expecting a change in the size of the displays in the iPhone 17 lineup. Here's what we know.

<h2>Standard iPhone 17</h2>
<br/>
Apple could introduce a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/22/iphone-17-lineup-specs-detail-upgrades/">new display size</a> for the standard iPhone 17 model in 2025. The iPhone 17 could measure in at 6.3 inches, up from 6.1 inches, which would make it the same size as the current iPhone 16 Pro. At 6.3 inches, it would be in between the size of the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 and the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus. However, next year there may be only one non-Pro model in Apple's lineup (see below).

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman recently reported that Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-custom-bluetooth-wifi-chip/">developing its own Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip</a> that will debut in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-tv-homepod-mini-2025-launch/">new Apple TV and HomePod mini models next year</a>. The report led to hopes that Apple might also use the chip to revive its line of AirPort routers, which were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/04/26/apple-officially-discontinues-airport-wireless-router-lineup/">discontinued in 2018</a>, but those dreams have been dashed by Gurman himself.

            Apple is working on a variety of health features for future AirPods, including heart rate monitoring and temperature sensing, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-12-22/apple-explores-amazon-ring-doorbell-competitor-with-face-id-airpods-heart-rate"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple appears to be internally testing iOS 18.2.1 for the iPhone, based on evidence of the software update in our website's analytic logs this week. The logs have accurately revealed many iOS versions before they were released.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954594" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
iOS 18.2.1 should be a minor update that fixes bugs and/or addresses security vulnerabilities, but it is unclear which specific issues might be resolved. The update will likely be released in late December or early January.
<br/>
<br/>
There could be accompanying updates, such as macOS 15.2.1, but we have not confirmed that.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.2.1 will follow iOS 18.2, which was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/apple-releases-ios-18-2-update/">released earlier this month</a>. iOS 18.2 introduced more Apple Intelligence features for iPhone 15 Pro models and all iPhone 1 [...]<br>

<br/>
It is unclear how much the screen-equipped HomePod would cost, but Apple is seemingly aiming for a reasonable price. In a paywalled report this week, the supply chain publication said Apple has selected China-based manufacturer Tianma to supply the LCD panels for the device, at an "exceptionally competitive" price of $10 per panel. The low cost of this component would likely contribute to the device being more affordable.
