            The calendar has turned to April, so we have updated our chart comparing the Apple Card savings account's annual percentage yield (APY) to some other popular high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs) available to U.S. residents.

<br/>
With a 4.5% APY, Apple's savings account remains a middle-of-the-pack HYSA, but balance minimums and other requirements vary by financial institution.
