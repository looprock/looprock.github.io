            Apple in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> is introducing a new Live Voicemail feature that is designed to provide you with a transcript of the message that's being left as the person is speaking, so you can choose to pick up the phone if it's important.

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Personalization is vital to connect our unique marketplace to the right buyer at the right time. Etsy has recently introduced a novel, general approach to personalizing ML models based on encoding and learning from short-term (one-hour) sequences of user actions through a reusable three-component deep learning module, the <em>adSformer Diversifiable Personalization Module (ADPM)</em>. We describe in detail our method in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01255.pdf">recent paper</a>, with an emphasis on personalizing the CTR (clickthrough rate) and PCCVR (post-click conversion rate) ranking models we use in Etsy Ads. Here, we'd like to present a brief overview.</p>
<p>Etsy offers its sellers the opportunity to place sponsored listings as a supplement to the organic results returned by Etsy search. For sellers and buyers alike, it‚Äôs important that those sponsored listings be as relevant to the user‚Äôs intent as possible.

The Ember Travel Mug 2 is $200, and the reason it's so expensive is because it's self-heating.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Judge Torres‚Äôs ruling carries significant implications for the blockchain industry, specifically with regard to Ripple's Programmatic Sales. 

The court's decision and analysis regarding Ripple's public sales arguably blesses all public exchange sales of cryptocurrencies as non-securities under Howey. 

Additionally, the SEC‚Äôs separate allegations, suggesting that Coinbase acted as an unregistered exchange for securities, should not survive following this decision.

Specifically, the court‚Äôs decision raises a question as to whether any of the other tokens listed on Coinbase (or any other exchange), which could be considered programmatic "blind sales," would fall under securities regulations.<br>
