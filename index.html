We're sure to see some of the same love it or hate it type of reactions with the 2025 revamp.</li>

            Every year heading into <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC</a>, one thought on many Mac fans' minds is what Apple will choose as the name for the next version of macOS.

            The Apple TV 4K (second- and third-generation) is capable of relaying audio from a compatible TV to a HomePod – even when you're not using your Apple TV. This allows you to stream audio from a TV-connected game console or other set-top box straight to Apple's smart speakers. Keep reading to learn more and how to set it up.

<br/>
The second- and third-generation Apple TV 4K supports two additional connection standards, called ARC and eARC. ARC (Audio Return Channel) is a feature of HDMI 1.4 that enables audio from a device to be sent to a compatible TV and relayed through its HDMI port to a separate audio receiver, speaker, or sound bar. Meanwhile, eARC (enhanced ARC) adds support for the passthrough of higher bandwidth audio like Dolby Atmos, as well as 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound.

            Apple is believed to be developing several technological innovations to mark the 20th anniversary of the iPhone, and one key technology it's considering is Mobile High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), according to a report from <em><a href="https://www.etnews.com/20250514000084">ETNews</a></em>.

HBM is a type of DRAM that stacks memory chips vertically  and connects them via tiny vertical interconnects called Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs) to dramatically boost signal transmission speeds. It's primarily used in AI servers today, and is often referred to as AI memory due to its ability to support AI processing alongside GPUs.
