            Apple is expected to announce new MacBook Air models with the M4 chip <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/02/m4-macbook-air-imminent/">as soon as this week</a>, and new iPads should follow shortly after.

<br/>
iPad Air and iPad 10 inventory is running low at Apple Stores, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-02/apple-siri-compared-with-alexa-m4-macbook-air-and-ipad-air-2025-coming-soon-m7rn2k2y"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman believes</a> this is a sign that new iPads will be introduced soon.
<br/>
<br/>
However, unlike the new MacBook Air, he said the new iPad models "probably won't come in the next few days."

So, the timeframe for the new iPads is not narrowed down yet, but it seems like the devices will not be unveiled at the same time as the MacBook Air with the M4 chi [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-02 07:46:01-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>

<br/>
Gurman said Apple was initially planning to launch the Apple Intelligence enhancements for Siri in iOS 18.4, but it seems that the features have been pushed back until iOS 18.5 due to a lack of readiness and software bugs. Accordingly, none of the promised features are available <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-4-features/">in the first beta of iOS 18.4</a> released last month.

            iOS 19 is still around three months away from being unveiled, but there are plenty of rumors about the upcoming update.

Below, we recap iOS 19 rumors so far.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Redesigned Camera App</h2>
<br/>
A leak earlier this year allegedly revealed a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/ios-19-redesigned-camera-app-visionos-rumor/">redesigned Camera app coming with iOS 19</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
On his YouTube channel Front Page Tech in January, Jon Prosser <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaP_q9W3AQE">shared a video</a> showing what the new Camera app will apparently look like, with the key change being translucent menus for camera controls. Overall, the design of these menus looks similar to visionOS, the software platform for Apple's Vision Pro headset.

            Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Apple offered a line of Wi-Fi routers that it referred to as AirPort base stations. There was a standard AirPort Express, a higher-end AirPort Extreme with more advanced networking features, and an AirPort Time Capsule that doubled as an external storage drive for backing up a Mac with Time Machine.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-28 07:53:58-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Microsoft today announced that it will officially retire Skype on May 5, 2025, concluding its 14-year tenure as the owner of the once-dominant internet calling and messaging service (via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-28/microsoft-msft-to-shut-down-skype-as-zoom-teams-dominate-video-calls"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>).

<br/>
Microsoft acquired Skype in 2011 for $8.5 billion in what was then its largest-ever acquisition. At its peak, Skype had more than 300 million monthly active users and was synonymous with internet-based voice and video calling. The service steadily declined in relevance in recent years, with its active user base shrinking to approximately 36 million by 2023 as competitors such as Zoom, WhatsApp, and Microsoft's own Teams platform gained traction.

Teams has since grown to 320 million [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's new entry-level iPhone 16e has inherited the Action button first seen on the iPhone 15 Pro and now found on all iPhone 16 models. The Action button replaces the traditional Ring/Silent switch – a staple of the iPhone since it launched in 2007. For users unfamiliar with the Action button, here's a rundown of its functions – including one that is (currently) exclusive to iPhone 16e.

<br/>
The Action button replaces the single-function switch used to toggle between ring and silent, offering additional options so users can choose between quickly accessing the camera or flashlight, activate Voice Memos, Focus modes, Translate, and accessibility features like Magnifier. Users can also associate it with Shortcuts for more options.

The NHL Watch Comms app allows referees to receive in-game updates by syncing with the NHL's Oasis system. Officials can track the game clock and receive alerts for key game events without diverting their focus. This allows referees to avoid locating video boards while officiating.

The app includes haptic feedback to indicate key moments, such as when a player leaves the penalty box or when the period is about to end. Distinct haptic patterns allow referees to differentiate between different notifications without needing to  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has offered a reason why the iPhone 16e doesn't include MagSafe, one of the more notable omissions from its latest entry-level smartphone.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-992294" height="1100" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iphone-16e-usb-c-feature.jpg" width="1956"/>
<br/>
According to Apple representatives who spoke to <em><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/the_iphone_16e">Daring Fireball</a></em>'s John Gruber, MagSafe is not included in the iPhone 16e because "most people in the iPhone 16e's target audience exclusively charge their phones by plugging them into a charging cable."
<br/>
<br/>
These users apparently tend not to use wireless charging at all, and when they do use it, Apple believes the slower 7.5W Qi charging speed compared to MagSafe's faster rates isn't a deciding factor for the customer segment it is targeting with the more affordable device.

Introduced with the iPhone 12 lineup in 2020, MagSafe uses ma [...]<br>

<p>Yes, <strong>“working people”</strong> is a shibboleth in U.S. political discourse, particularly among progressive and labor-oriented politicians. It’s often used as a way to signal alignment with <strong>workers, unions, and the middle or lower class</strong> without explicitly saying “working class,” which can carry more rigid or ideological connotations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>On the left</strong>, Democrats and labor advocates frequently use “working people” to emphasize economic struggles and the need for policies like higher wages, healthcare, and workers' rights. Figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and union leaders use it to frame their rhetoric around economic justice.</p>
