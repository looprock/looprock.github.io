            Apple's next MacBook Pro models will enter mass production soon, according to the latest information shared by <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Apple often releases new Macs in October, but both Gurman and Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously said the next MacBook Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/10/no-m5-macbook-pro-2025/">might not arrive until early 2026</a>. Apple ann [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is preparing to release iOS 26.0.1, according to a private account on X with a proven track record of sharing information about future iOS versions.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020170" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/iOS-26.0.1-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
The account initially said iOS 26.0.1 would have a build number of 23A350, but they now expect the update to have a build number of 23A355. This suggests that the software update will include more bug fixes or changes than initially planned.
<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> has also seen evidence of iOS 26.0.1 in its visitor logs in recent days, as Apple's software engineers test the update internally.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26.0.1 will likely address a handful of software bugs and issues:<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/17/apple-iphone-17-camera-glitch-fix/">A camera-related bug</a> on the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro</li>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-26 08:53:38-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, Apple Intelligence makes the Wallet app's order tracking feature genuinely useful by scanning your email for shipping details. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1013341" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/ios-26-beta-5-wallet-app.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
The ability to track orders in Apple Wallet isn't new – it's actually been around since iOS 16. But if you've never noticed it before, don't worry. Most people haven't used it either.
<br/>
<br/>
The feature initially struggled because it relied on merchants to actively support it, but not many bothered. In fact, despite being available for years, order tracking in Apple's Wallet app remained largely unused. But there's a decent chance iOS 26 will change all that.

We discuss the radically thin and light design of the ‌iPhone Air‌, and what it really feels like to use the device. We look at its surprisingly impressive durability and battery life, as well as its drawbacks in terms of speakers and rear camera versatility.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, Apple has extended Visual Intelligence to work with content that's on your iPhone, allowing you to ask questions about what you're seeing, look up products, and more.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Visual Intelligence started out in iOS 18.2 as a Camera Control button function that can describe what you are looking at, get details about a restaurant or business, translate text, and the like.
<br/>
<br/>
But in iOS 26, Visual Intelligence is no longer just for learning more about your physical surroundings. You can also use the feature to analyze content on your iPhone screen, simply by pressing the same buttons you use to take a screenshot. 
<br/>

You can search across apps, go straight to relevant websites, add an event to your calendar, and more. Keep reading to learn what you can do with it. Note that Visual Intelligence is an [...]<br>
