            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iMessage will avoid regulation under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), following the conlusion of an investigation by the regulator (via <em><em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-13/apple-imessage-microsoft-bing-dodge-eu-s-big-tech-crackdown">Bloomberg</a></em></em>).

<br/>
The probe concluded that the iMessage platform and Microsoft's Bing do not hold a dominant enough position to be brought under the DMA's strict rules for services provided by big tech's so-called digital "gatekeepers," which include Apple, Meta, Google, Amazon, and TikTok, according to the EU.

Apple and Microsoft said they welcomed the decision in separate statements following the announcement.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-02-13 03:56:35-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Peloton is dropping support for Apple GymKit in favor of Peloton One-Tap tracking, the fitness equipment company revealed to users in an email on Monday.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-757966" height="457" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/peloton-bike-plus-treadmill-gymkit.jpg" width="921"/>
<br/>
The lack of GymKit integration is unlikely to be a major concern to recent Peloton users with Apple Watch, since their health data is already synced to Peloton's app, which also shares the data with Apple's Health app.
<br/>
<br/>
The change is more likely to irk existing Bike+ owners who originally purchased the $2,495 stationary workout bike based on the premise that GymKit was an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/08/peloton-announces-bike-gymkit-support/">exclusive perk</a>. That said, GymKit has become less important since Peloton rolled out Apple Watch integration to all its fitness equipment in 2022.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            On this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/one-week-with-apple-vision-pro-ft-quinn-nelson-snazzy-labs/id1602394741?i=1000644778180">The MacRumors Show</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@snazzy">Snazzy Labs</a>' Quinn Nelson joins us to talk about the first week using Apple's long-awaited Vision Pro headset.

Now that they each have one, Quinn and Dan discuss whether the Vision Pro meets their expectations. A significant portion of our dialogue is dedicated to the technical aspects of the Vision Pro, including its display quality, brightness, and the challenges users might face with hand gestures and text selection. The conversation progresses to evaluate the device's text sharpness, its implications for productivity, and how comfortable it feels with the two headband options.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-02-09 08:32:26-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 will feature visionOS-inspired design elements, according to a rumor shared this week by <a href="https://theverifier.co.il/62189/exclusive-apple-ios-18-visionos/">Israeli website <em>The Verifier</em></a>.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935810" height="1012" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/visionOS-design.jpeg" width="1800"/>
<br/>
For example, the report claims that the Apple TV app on iPadOS 18 will feature the same translucent navigation bar that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/apple-tv-app-redesign-tvos-17-2/">introduced in the tvOS 17.2 version of the app</a> last year. The design of this menu draws similarities to visionOS, the operating system that runs on Apple's new Vision Pro headset, which launched in the U.S. last week.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple also plans to redesign various other system menus and built-in apps on iOS 18, including Safari, according to the report.
