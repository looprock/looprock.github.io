            <b>Published:</b> 2024-08-23 04:28:07-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Google Maps is rolling out a redesigned bottom bar to iPhones that aims to give the app a less cluttered look by reducing the number of tabs on the screen.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Previously only on Android, the new bottom bar reduces the number of tabs from five to three. As spotted by <em><a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/22/google-maps-bottom-bar-redesign-iphone/">9to5Google</a></em>, "Go" has been removed, but users can still access it using a new "You" middle tab, via a new "Saved trips" section therein.
<br/>
<br/>
"You" was previously called "Saved," and retains the same bookmark icon. But tapping it takes you to an updated page with new top tabs for "Notifications" and "Messages," both of which serve content that was previously found in the "Upd [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-08-23 03:57:12-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Instagram has announced a new feature that allows users to add a song to their profile, an update that harks back to Myspace in the early 2000s.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962242" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/instagram-song-on-profile.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
Added music appears in the bio area of a user's profile. Unlike Myspace, the songs don't autoplay when someone visits a user's profile. Visitors can play and pause the song - or song sample, since the duration of the music is capped at 30 seconds.
<br/>
<br/>
"We're excited to announce that you can now add a song to your profile, giving you more ways to express yourself through music," Instagram said in a <a href="https://www.threads.net/@creators/post/C--rFylx7Be">post</a> from its creators account. "Your profile song selection will be live until you swap out the song."
<br/>
<br/>
To add a song, users need to go to the "edit profile" page and select "Add music to you [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Google last week introduced the Pixel 9 smartphone lineup, with a selection of new devices that are focused on AI. All of the Pixel 9 phones support Gemini AI, and Google has also added AI-based image generation and editing tools. Reviewers have been testing the new smartphone features, and the AI image generation is probably going to turn into a PR nightmare for Google based on what's come out so far.

<br/>
Google introduced an AI image generation app for the Pixel phones, called Pixel Studio. It's designed to create stickers and images using text-based prompts, and it looks and sounds a lot like Apple's planned Image Playground. So far, reviewers have been able to create all manner of questionable images with Pixel Studio, ranging from a Nazi version of Spongebob to Elmo with an AK47.
