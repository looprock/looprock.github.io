            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-05 08:50:16-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, currently in beta, Apple offers a new Adaptive Power Mode that works alongside the existing Low Power Mode to intelligently extend your iPhone's battery life. Unlike Low Power Mode's heavy restrictions, this AI-powered feature makes subtle adjustments that you're barely meant to notice. Here's how it works.

<br/>
<h2>What Adaptive Power Mode Does</h2>
<br/>
When your battery usage runs higher than usual, Adaptive Power Mode automatically makes small performance tweaks to help your iPhone last longer. Apple says this includes slightly dimming the display brightness or allowing some tasks to "take a little longer" to complete.
<br/>
<br/>
The feature works in the background without the limitations of Low Power Mode, although the latter may still be activated if your device depletes to a 20% charge level.

            WhatsApp is testing a new feature that allows people to communicate with users over the platform even if they don't have an account.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786421" height="1266" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Whatsapp-Feature.jpg" width="2250"/>
<br/>
According to <em><a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-25-22-13-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a></em>, the latest WhatsApp beta for Android contains references to so-called "guest chats," which lets users send a link to an online chat, where the "guest" doesn't have to have an app on their device or even need to be in possession of a WhatsApp account.
<br/>
<br/>
To kick off a guest chat, the WhatsApp user has to invite someone from their contacts who doesn't have the app installed and share a chat link. When the recipient opens the link, they're granted access to an online end-to-end encrypted chat with the sender – likely via an interface similar to WhatsApp Web.

<br/>
According to a source familiar with the company's plans, Apple is highly likely to replace the current ‌Apple TV‌ 4K with a new model later this year. The current model will be discontinued.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-05 02:03:37-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Despite being over two years old, Apple's AirPods Pro 2 still dominate the premium wireless‑earbud space, thanks to a potent mix of top‑tier audio, class‑leading noise cancellation, and Apple's habit of delivering major new features through software updates. Rumors suggest AirPods Pro 3 could arrive as soon as September 2025 alongside the iPhone 17 lineup, giving prospective AirPods buyers a dilemma: snap up the proven AirPods Pro 2 at today's prices, or hold off for the next‑generation model that could raise the bar once again?

Apart from their sonic strengths, the enduring popularity of AirPods Pro 2 owes much to Apple's ongoing feature rollouts. iOS 17 (2023) introduced Adaptive Audio, mute controls, and faster device switching. iOS 18 (2024) followed up with &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-airpods-p [...]<br>

            The most notable change to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> is the Liquid Glass design overhaul, which is the first major iOS design update since Apple rolled out iOS 7 back in 2013. There are new features in ‌iOS 26‌, of course, but added functionality has definitely been sidelined in favor of the design refresh.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 26, currently in beta, gives you two distinct ways to add websites to your iPhone's Home screen – as web apps or traditional bookmarks. They might look similar at first glance, but choosing the right option can dramatically improve how you access your favorite sites.

<h2>Understanding the Difference</h2>
<br/>
When you add a website to your Home screen via Safari's "Add to Home Screen" option, iOS 26 automatically detects whether the site supports progressive web app (PWA) functionality. Web apps run almost like native apps, with features like offline access, push notifications, and a streamlined interface without Safari's address bar. In contrast, traditional bookmarks simply open the website in Safari when tapped.

            Missing the familiar Safari design from iOS 18? In iOS 26, currently in beta, Apple has learned from past criticism and made it easy to ditch the new Compact layout in favor of the classic tab layouts you may well prefer.

MCP, short for Model Context Protocol, acts like a concierge for AI agents: It makes a product’s API, telemetry schema and helper tools easily discoverable so large-language models can ask precise questions instead of guessing.
