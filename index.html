            <b>Published:</b> 2025-07-22 15:56:48-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple released the fourth beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> today, and the company has continued making changes to the way that Liquid Glass looks. There are also new features, including the return of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> Notification Summaries for news. This beta is of particular interest because it's likely the beta that public beta testers will get in the not too distant future.

An image buried in the Health app code features an Apple Watch with an "84" on it. Around the sides of the number, there are three bars that are the same colors as some of the sleep stages that can be tracked with the Apple Watch. The orange could represent time awake, the lighter blue may correspond with REM sleep, and the darker blue could be Core or Deep sleep.

The watch graphic is surrounded by sleep-related icons that Apple uses in different places in iOS, including a moon and stars, a "zzz," a bed, an icon representing sleep stages, an alarm clock, and in one spot, [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Setting custom ringtones on your iPhone is dramatically easier in iOS 26. Apple has eliminated the need for the cumbersome process of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2ceDaBdwZg">exporting a track from the GarageBand app</a>, and now provides a simple four-step process that works directly from the Files app.

<br/>
The new streamlined approach means you can transform any MP3 or M4A audio file that's less than 30 seconds into a personalized ringtone in a just a few taps. Whether it's a favorite song snippet, a voice memo, or a sound effect you've downloaded, the process is now as straightforward as sharing a photo. Here's how to set up your custom ringtone without opening an additional app in iOS 26 (currently in beta).

            In iOS 26, Apple is introducing several new features for its Messages app, and this one in particular is likely to make interacting with message bubbles way less frustrating. 
<br/>

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010448" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/ios-26-messages-select-copy-paste.jpg" width="2000"/>

When you tap and hold on any message bubble, a new "Select" option now appears alongside the familiar copy and reaction choices, finally solving one of Messages' most persistent frustrations.
<br/>
<br/>
The Select feature allows you to highlight specific portions of text within a message rather than copying the entire message. Simply tap and hold any message bubble, choose "Select" from the contextual menu, and then use the drag handles to highlight exactly the text you need. It works across all message types, including text messages and iMessages.

The iPhone 16 series drove Apple's performance, accounting for over 55% of the company's shipments in the quarter.

            Apple appears to have accidentally distributed the macOS Tahoe public beta to some Mac users ahead of the beta's official launch.

<br/>
A selection of public beta testers and developers who have opted into either the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15 developer beta or the ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15 public beta are instead receiving the macOS Tahoe public beta. The beta that Apple is distributing has a build number of 25A5316i, which is newer than the 25A5306g build number of the third macOS Tahoe developer beta.
<br/>
<br/>
macOS Tahoe is showing up for Apple silicon Mac users who do not have Rosetta 2 installed. Most Apple silicon Macs <em>do</em> have Rosetta installed, and those Macs won't detect the mistaken beta release.
