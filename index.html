            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iOS 18.4, Apple made a small tweak to Safari that could be polarizing because it puts your search history front and center. When you open up a new Safari tab and then tap into the search field, Safari shows your recent search history.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991973" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/ios-18-4-safari-search.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
In iOS 18.3.1, opening up a new tab and then tapping into search does not show your history, and the view remains on the personalized Safari home page. iOS 18.3.1 has no clear view of prior searches at all, except that a recent search will show up in your suggested results if you search for the same thing again.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-26 02:40:19-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In macOS, a Text Clipping is a selection of text that you've dragged from an application to another location on your Mac, where it becomes a unique kind of standalone file. 
<br/>
<br/>
The relatively little-known feature has been around since at least Mac OS 9, and it offers a convenient way to save out pieces of text from pretty much anywhere for later use in another app or document.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991857" height="2880" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/macos-text-clippings-hidden-feature.jpg" width="5120"/>
<br/>
To create a Text Clipping, simply highlight any piece of text, then hold left-click and drag it with your mouse to your Desktop or an open Finder window. 
<br/>
<br/>
This saves the highlighted text – including any rich text formatting – as a <strong>.textclipping</strong> file named after the first few words of text that you selected, but you can easily rename it to make it more identifiable.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Multiple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owners today noticed a pronunciation processing issue that causes the word "Trump" to momentarily show up when using dictation to send a message with the word "racist."

<br/>
In some cases, when speaking the word racist through the ‌iPhone‌'s built-in dictation feature, the ‌iPhone‌ briefly interprets the spoken word as "Trump" and "Trump" text shows up in the Messages app before being corrected to the actual word (racist) as Apple's processing interprets what was said.
<br/>
<br/>
Speaking the word racist with dictation doesn't always show "Trump" first, though it did show up more often than other words in our testing. We also saw "Rhett" and "Rouch" appear before the ‌iPhone‌ corrects to racist.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            LG TV owners can now install the Philips Hue Sync TV app to synchronize their lights with content on the TV without the need for an additional set-top box.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Hue parent company Signify said in January that the app would expand to LG TVs in early 2025, and it is now available from the <a href="https://us.lgappstv.com/main/tvapp/detail?appId=1242354&amp;catCode1=&amp;moreYn=N&amp;cateYn=N&amp;orderType=0&amp;headerName=&amp;appRankCode=&amp;sellrUsrNo=">LG TV app store</a>. Previously, the app was limited to Samsung TVs.
<br/>
<br/>
The app is priced at $130 without a subscription, or $3 per month, and it works with 2024 LG Smart TVs that run webOS 24. The app is expensive, but it is more affordable than the Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box that costs $350.

The Find N5 has a 6.62-inch display when closed, and an 8.12-inch display when open, so when unfolded, it's just a bit smaller than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>.
