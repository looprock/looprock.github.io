In November 2024, an anonymous listener of the Relay FM tech podcast "Upgrade" claimed that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/apple-working-on-90hz-studio-display-imac-ipad-air/">developing 90Hz display technology</a> that could be used for the next Studio Display, as well as future iPad Air and iMac models. A higher refresh rate can make videos and scrolling look smoother to the eye, but 90Hz would stop short of the 120Hz refresh rate that iPhone, iPad, and Mac models with ProMotion support can achieve.

<br/>
As in previous years, Replay 2026 ranks your most-played songs on ‌Apple Music‌ from 1 to 100, updating weekly as your listening habits evolve throughout 2026. Apple typically activates Replay in early February, once January listening data has finished processing, allowing subscribers to track their music activity well ahead of the traditional year-end recap.
<br/>
<br/>
Unlike a static summary released in December, Replay primarily functions as an evolving playlist. From its first appearance in February, rankings refresh every weekend, gradually building a complete picture of your top songs across t [...]<br>

The Weibo user claims that since the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> lineup proved to be successful with high sales, the ‌iPhone 18‌ models likely won't have major changes to their appearance. Rather than promoting design changes, Apple is apparently likely to heavily emphasize advancements made with the A20 and A20 Pro chip, which will likely be the first 2nm Apple silicon chips. This upgrade is anticipated to be a key point of discussion around the new devices later this year.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <blockquote>
<p>AI is still stuck in “efficiency mode.” In many organizations, a technology organization leads AI efforts and is treated as a cost center. Those CIOs are incentivized to optimize for efficiency, not growth. The result is predictable: Tech-led AI strategies deliver productivity improvements, but not transformation. Equally concerning is that technology and AI executives tell us their business partners can’t articulate what they want from AI beyond saving money. That leadership gap bleeds over into the measurement of AI value. While most agree that AI boosts productivity, only 13% report positive EBITDA impact, and fewer than a third link AI contributions to P&amp;L. Without financial accountability, AI becomes an endless pilot treadmill — producing activity without outcomes. To shift AI from incremental savings to strategic advantage, business leaders must step in, define value in P&amp;L terms, and own the linkage between AI-driven productivity and financial performance.
But:</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Introduction Modern advertising platforms are fast-paced and interconnected: even small adjustments can have ripple effects on how ads are shown, how budgets are spent, and the value advertisers get from their ad spend. At Yelp, Ad Budget Allocation means splitting each campaign’s spend between on‑platform inventory (our website, mobile site, and app) and off‑platform inventory (the Yelp Ad Network). We optimize this split to meet advertisers’ performance goals while growing overall revenue. Due to the complexity of the budget allocation system and its feedback loop, even small changes can lead to unexpected system‑wide effects. To help us safely evaluate changes,...<br>
