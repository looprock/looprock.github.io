            Apple is expanding the Weather app in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a> with a new feature: Severe Weather Alerts and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Widgets</a> for Predicted Travel Destinations. This enhancement offers proactive notifications for locations you may soon visit, leveraging Apple's "Proactive Intelligence" to keep you informed before you arrive.

Code in ‌iOS 26‌ discovered by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://x.com/stevemoser">Steve Moser</a> references the "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a>" alongside the "‌AirPods Pro‌" and the "‌AirPods Pro‌ 2."

There is no ‌AirPods Pro 3‌ at the current time, but rumors suggest that Apple plans to introduce a new model this fall. The reference is buried in a headphone-related UI framework, so Apple appears to be preparing for the upcoming product launch behind the scenes.

            Following its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/wwdc-2025-live-coverage/">WWDC keynote</a> on Monday, Apple updated a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/about-the-rosetta-translation-environment">developer document</a> to indicate that Rosetta 2 will remain available through macOS 27.

Rosetta 2 enables Macs with Apple silicon (Arm architecture) to run apps that were built for Macs with an Intel processor (x86 architecture), by translating code.

Starting with macOS 28, Apple said that only a limited version of Rosetta 2 will remain available for older games that rely on Intel-based frameworks:<blockquote>Rosetta was designed to make the transition to Apple silicon easier, and we plan to make it available for the next two major macOS releases – through macOS 27 – as </blockquote> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has released the first iOS 26 beta to developers, but even non-developers have the opportunity to download beta software updates on their iPhones for free. Keep reading to learn how it's done.

<br/>
Traditionally, when Apple announced a major new operating system update, the first wave of betas would only be available to download by paying subscribers to <a href="https://developer.apple.com">Apple's Developer Program</a>, which costs $99 a year. Public betas would then become available to users enrolled in <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/welcome">Apple's Public Beta Software Program</a> after a delay of a few days or weeks after the developer beta has been released. That all changed in 2023, and these days iPhone users no longer have to wait for a publicly released beta to test what's new.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-10 04:43:32-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26 beta 1, Apple has seemingly tweaked the swipe-to-go-back gesture to make it easier to navigate screens on bigger iPhones.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005254" height="3078" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/swipe-to-go-back-gesture-ios-26.jpg" width="5472"/>
<br/>
In iOS 18, many apps allow you to navigate back to the previous screen by swiping with your thumb from the left edge of the display. This is generally easier than tapping a back button in the top-left corner, especially if you're navigating with one hand. 
<br/>
<br/>
However, to trigger the gesture, you need to start swiping from the very edge of the screen, which is harder if you have small hands or you're using a larger device like an iPhone 16 Pro Max.
<br/>
<br/>
To make things easier in iOS 26, you no longer have to start the rightward swipe at the very edge of the screen. Now you can start the gesture from anywhere, like the middle of the display. Providing you're not  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's first iOS 26 beta includes a new "Keep Audio in Headphones" setting that addresses a common frustration for iPhone users juggling multiple audio devices.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005246" height="3078" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/keep-audio-headphones-ios-26.jpg" width="5472"/>
<br/>
Found in Settings ➝ General ➝ AirPlay &amp; Continuity, the new toggle prevents audio from automatically switching to newly connected devices like car speakers or Bluetooth speakers when you're already listening through headphones or AirPods. Instead of having your music suddenly blast through your car's sound system, audio continues playing through your original output device.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple in watchOS 26 has added a new one-handed wrist-flick gesture to easily dismiss notifications, but the gesture only works on newer Apple Watch models.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005223" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/wrist-flick-dismiss-notifications.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
When you raise your wrist to check a notification but aren’t ready to respond, you can now simply flick your wrist – turn it over and back – to dismiss it. The quick gesture lets you dismiss notifications and incoming calls, silence timers and alarms, and return to the watch face. 
<br/>
<br/>
It works by using the accelerometer and gyroscope in your watch, along with a machine learning model that analyzes your wrist movement. However, the functionality is limited to Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch 10, and Apple Watch Ultra 2.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a>, Apple updated the Battery section of the Settings app to provide a much more in-depth look at how your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> usage impacts battery life and how much battery apps are draining, plus there are new battery management tools.

<br/>
At the top of the Battery interface, there's a readout of your current battery and the time that you last charged. If your ‌iPhone‌ is currently charging, it will let you know how much time is remaining until a full charge.
<br/>
<br/>
Battery usage is no longer split by 24 hours and 10 days, with Apple providing just a weekly view of average battery use along with a comparison of how much battery you're currently using compared to your typical average.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-09 17:44:34-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            While the new software updates that Apple showed off today are only available to developers at the current time, Apple does plan to release public betas.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005210" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/apple-beta-26-lineup.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
In the fine print for most of its software announcements, Apple says that public betas for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a>, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe, watchOS 26, and tvOS 26 will be coming "next month," aka July. Apple has been releasing public betas during July for quite some time now, as the timeline allows for a few rounds of developer beta testing for feature refinements before a wider beta rollout.
<br/>
<br/>
So when in July will we get the public beta? Here are Apple's past release dates:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li><strong>iOS 18</strong> - July 15</li>
<br/>
<li><strong>iOS 17</strong> - July 12</li>

            At today's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a> keynote event, Apple unveiled a new design that will inform the next decade of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS development, so needless to say, it was a busy day. Apple also unveiled a ton of new features for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, an overhauled Spotlight interface for the Mac, and a ton of updates that make the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> more like a Mac than ever before.

            With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a>, Apple added a bunch of new options for the Background Sounds feature.

            This article was originally published in 2018, yet its core insights into Go’s garbage collection model remain highly relevant for developers today. While some implementation details of Go’s runtime have evolved, the foundational concepts explored here—such as the semantics of the tri-color mark and sweep algorithm, Stop The World (STW) events, and GC trace interpretation—are still essential to understanding how Go manages memory. Whether you&rsquo;re optimizing performance or deepening your knowledge of Go internals, this post continues to offer a clear and practical guide to working with the garbage collector, not against it.<br>
