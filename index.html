            <b>Published:</b> 2025-04-22 08:23:32-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple devices support a relatively unknown three-finger gesture that lets you share a photo across your devices in super-quick time. It's a neat trick to fall back on if AirDrop is playing up or your iCloud Photos are taking ages to sync. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950932" height="1720" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/ipad-pro-magic-keyboard-apple-pencil.jpg" width="3057"/>
<br/>
Universal Clipboard is usually associated with copying and pasting text, but by using this gesture, you can make it work really well for sharing images between your devices too.
<br/>
<br/>
It can be used to quickly copy images across nearby devices for pasting into Messages, Notes, emails, Pages, and other apps with input fields.
<br/>
<br/>
For the following steps to work, you'll need to have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned on and your devices signed into the same Apple Account and connected to the same network.

<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
In the video, a man flexes his muscles in front of a mirror, while a woman takes photos of him with an iPhone. Later, the man realizes that the woman is visible in the mirror in the background of the photos, so he uses the Clean Up tool to remove her. The ad emphasizes the ease of using the feature, but in reality it does not always work perfectly.
<br/>
<br/>
Clean Up is an Apple Intelligence feature, meaning that it is only available on the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, or any iPhone 16 model. It was one of the first Apple Intelligence features to roll out, as part of iOS 18.1 last year.<div class="linkback">Tags: &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads</div> [...]<br>

            Netflix is testing a new search feature powered by OpenAI technology that aims to improve how users discover content on the streaming platform, according to multiple reports.

            Despite being more than two years old, Apple's AirPods Pro 2 still dominate the premium wireless‑earbud space, thanks to a potent mix of top‑tier audio, class‑leading noise cancellation, and Apple's habit of delivering major new features through software updates. With AirPods Pro 3 widely expected to arrive in 2025, prospective buyers now face a familiar dilemma: snap up the proven <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2 at today's prices, or hold off for the next‑generation model that could raise the bar once again.
