            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is developing a new feature that will synchronize captive Wi-Fi portal login information across devices, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-11/apple-2027-plans-tabletop-robot-20th-anniversary-iphone-ios-19-wi-fi-feature"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

<br/>
The system will allow users to enter login details for captive Wi-Fi networks – commonly found in hotels, airports, and coffee shops – just once, then automatically sync that information across their iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices.
<br/>
<br/>
"When you go to a new hotel, office building or gym, you're often asked to fill out a web form on all your devices before you can access the internet," Gurman reports. "This new feature will let you enter that information on one device and have it synched to your other products."

The company reportedly aims to pair the potential price hikes with new features and design changes to justify the increased cost to consumers, rather than attributing them to U.S. tariffs on goods from China.

The U.S. and China recently agreed to suspend most tariffs imposed during their trade dispute, but a 20% tariff implemented by President Trump on Chinese goods remains in place and covers smartphones.
