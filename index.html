            Apple's quarterly iPad revenue will significantly decline in the fourth quarter of 2023 on a year-over-year basis, according to estimated figures shared today by Erik Woodring, an analyst at investment firm Morgan Stanley.
<br/>

<br/>
Morgan Stanley estimates that Apple will report iPad revenue of $7.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023, which would be a decline of approximately 23% compared to the $9.4 billion that Apple reported for the segment in the year-ago quarter.
<br/>

            Apple is working on a new version of the 4K <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, and rumors suggest that it could launch as soon as 2024, two years after the launch of the current model. This guide includes details on everything that we expect to see in the 2024 ‌Apple TV‌ 4K.

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<br/>
Apple has not notably changed the design of the ‌Apple TV‌ in several years, and that's not going to change in 2024. We are not expecting any updates to the form factor, and it will continue to use the same slimmed-down black plastic body from the current ‌Apple TV‌ model.

            Gerhard joins us for the 12th Kaizen and this time talk about what we DIDN’T do. We were holding S3 wrong, we put some cash back in our pockets, we enabled HTTP/3, Brotli compression, and Fastly websockets, we improved our SLOs, we improved Changelog Nightly, and we’re going to KubeCon 2023 in Chicago.<br>

"Apple has committed to deploy an update in France," reads a translation of the update, which is in French. "This fix will be available to all users no later than October 24."

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The next-generation 24-inch iMac will likely be available with M2 and M2 Pro chip options, Thunderbolt 4 ports, Wi-Fi 6E support, and Bluetooth 5.3 support, according to a report today from <a href="https://www.macotakara.jp/macintosh/entry-45460.html">Japanese blog <em>Mac Otakara</em></a>.

<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has repeatedly claimed that the next 24-inch iMac <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/05/new-imac-advanced-development/">will be equipped with the M3 chip</a>, so it's unclear if the information reported today is accurate. It is possible that Apple's plans have changed, but no other sources have indicated that the iMac will be updated with M2 and M2 Pro chips as of yet.

<em>Mac Otakara</em> notes that some custom 24-inch iMac configurations are facing up to one-month shipping delays [...]<br>
