Imagine upgrading libraries, handling breaking changes, and adopting new features happening seamlessly — without pulling developers away from their real work. Not only would that be cool, but it would also help engineers stay focused on delivering business value by removing the toil that often makes reducing tech debt such a tough tradeoff.
