            <b>Published:</b> 2023-11-21 02:05:52-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WhatsApp has started allowing users to authenticate their account on a device with an email address as an alternative to using a phone number, for times when cellular coverage is poor. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786421" height="1266" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Whatsapp-Feature.jpg" width="2250"/>
<br/>
The new option to link an account to an email address does not replace SMS verification via a six-pin code, and opening a WhatsApp account still requires the user to provide a number. But with email verification, existing users now also have the means to authenticate their account on a device with an internet connection even if their cellular service is unavailable.

The key advantage is that it only incrementally processes data that are newly added or updated to a dataset, instead of re-processing the complete dataset. This not only reduces the cost of compute resources but also reduces the execution time in a significant manner. When workflow execution has a shorter duration, chances of failure and manual intervention reduce. It also improves the engineering productivity by simplifying the existing pipelines and unlocking the new patterns.</p><p>In this blog post, we talk about the landscape and the challenges in workflows at Netflix.

Apple has reportedly been working on its own modem since 2018, as it seeks to move away from Qualcomm's component currently used in iPhones. The timeframe for launching the modem has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-in-house-5g-modem-delays/">slipped several times</a> and is now expected to be ready around 2026, and Gurman now hears that Apple has plans for the chip appearing in other Apple devices further down the line.

After advertisers fled from X after Musk's takeover of the social network, Apple continued to pay for ad spots, and has been one of the Twitter's largest ad partners. Back in March, Musk <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/03/elon-musk-thanks-apple-disney-advertising-on-twitter-whic-would-have-gone-bankrupt-without-him-1235282055/">thanked Apple</a> for its support, calling the company one of Twitter's "biggest advertisers."

<br/>
Starting with the 9th generation iPad, Amazon has the 64GB Wi-Fi model for $249.00, down from $329.00. This is a match of the best price we've ever tracked on this iPad, and it's a great entry-level option for kids or family members who don't need a tablet for intensive tasks.
