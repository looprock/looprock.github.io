            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            One of the key changes to Safari on iOS 26 is a redesigned Liquid Glass address bar, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/10/apple-ios-26-safari-design/">three layouts available</a> to choose from. Beyond that, the upcoming software update includes a few smaller changes for the web browser.

<br/>
<h2>Web Apps For All Websites</h2>
<br/>
Starting with iOS 26, every website added to the Home Screen via Safari opens as a web app, even if it is not configured to be. On earlier iOS versions, websites that were not configured to open as a web app would open in Safari, meaning that the Home Screen app icons for those websites were effectively just bookmarks.

            Apple is considering introducing displays that use a lot less battery power in its iPhone lineup starting in 2027, according to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=37192">The Elec</a></em>.

<br/>
According to the Korean-language report, the technology would involve upgrading Apple's current LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) OLED displays by incorporating oxide semiconductors in both switching and drive transistors. 
<br/>
<br/>
Every iPhone screen has millions of tiny switches that control each pixel. Right now, Apple uses two different types of these switches: some are power-efficient but slow, while others are fast but power-hungry.

Apple's current plan has this year's iPhone 17 series using low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LPTO2) displays  [...]<br>

Trump's second TikTok extension will expire on June 19, and there appears to be no sign of a deal with China that would allow TikTok's U.S. operations to be sold to a U.S. company.

TikTok has been banned in the United States since January 19 due to the passing of the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, but Trump's extensions prevent the U.S. Department of Justice from enforcing the law and allow TikTok to r [...]<br>

<br/>
The upcoming software update adds a new Screen Capture menu to the Settings app, under General. In it, there are a few useful toggles.
<br/>
<br/>
First, there is now an option for HDR screenshots. When this format is selected, any HDR photos or videos in screenshots will actually appear in HDR with full dynamic range, when viewed on newer iPhone models and other supported devices.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple says HDR screenshots use the HEIF image format. There is still an option for SDR screenshots, which are saved as PNG files.
<br/>
<br/>
Second, CarPlay screenshots finally work on an opt-in basis. On iOS 18 and earlier, taking a screenshot on an iPhone connected to CarPlay generates both iPhone and CarPlay screenshots. Starting with iOS 26, however, onl [...]<br>

<br/>
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit today threw out a prior jury verdict that would have forced Apple to pay $300 million for infringing on standard-essential LTE patents owned by Optis.
<br/>
<br/>
When appealing the initial ruling from the Eastern District Court of Texas, Apple argued that the court had not fairly separated the different patent claims that it allegedly violated, and only asked the jurors to determine if Apple violated <em>any</em> patents. The federal appeals court agreed with Apple, and said that the district court ruling provided [...]<br>
