            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In computing lore, an Easter egg typically refers to a secret message, image, or feature intentionally left in software, often (but not always) hidden in plain sight. Since the 1970s, programmers have used them to credit unheralded developers, reference pop culture, sneak games into productivity apps, and generally inject a little bit of humanity into their code.

Apple Watch fast charging was introduced with the Apple Watch Series 7 in 2021, enabling devices to charge rapidly from 0 percent to 80 percent in about 45 minutes.

Going forward, Apple is focusing on production of fast-charging modules only.

Companies can continue to submit plans for accessories that include the original, non-fast-charging variant of the Apple Watch charger module (C162) until  [...]<br>
