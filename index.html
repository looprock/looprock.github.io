            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple plans to release new MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac mini models with the M4 series of chips "this year," according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-01/apple-readies-iphone-se-4-upgraded-ipad-air-for-early-2025"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

<br/>
Gurman initially said these Macs would likely be announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/06/new-ipad-mini-rumored-for-october/">during a virtual event this October</a>, but he has been more vague about the timing lately, with wording such as "in the coming weeks" and now merely "this year." In any case, it is clear that he expects the first Macs with M4 chips to be introduced before the calendar turns to 2025.

            Apple plans to release a new iPhone SE with Apple Intelligence support, new iPad Air models, and an updated Magic Keyboard for the iPad Air at some point "early next year," according to a report today from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-01/apple-readies-iphone-se-4-upgraded-ipad-air-for-early-2025"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

<br/>
The next iPhone SE will have a similar design as the iPhone 14, including an edge-to-edge screen with a notch, according to Gurman. This means the device will likely support Face ID, whereas the current iPhone SE has a Touch ID button.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Popular camera app Halide was today updated with new features for the Camera Control button available on the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models. Halide already supported opening the app with Camera Control, but now users can also make adjustments.

<br/>
Using the Camera Control's touch and swipe-based gesture support, Halide users can adjust focus and exposure, and lock their settings in place. The dedicated "Locked" adjustment makes sure that no settings can be disturbed from accidental swipes on the Camera Control button, and it is designed for people who do not want to use manual adjustments.
<br/>
<br/>
The Exposure setting allows users to set an exposure bias that exceeds what's possible with Apple's Camera app (-/+ 6 EV vs. 2), and Focus allows for manual focusing on a subject o [...]<br>

            Despite being released over two years ago, Apple's AirPods Pro 2 continue to dominate the wireless earbud market. However, with the AirPods Pro 3 expected to launch sometime in 2025, anyone thinking of buying Apple's premium earbuds may be wondering if the next generation is worth holding out for.

Apart from their audio and noise-canceling performance, which are generally regarded as excellent for such small buds, one of the reasons the AirPods Pro 2 have remained popular is Apple's commitment to updating their feature set with software updates.

When iOS 17 was released last year, AirPods Pro 2 got new Adaptive Audio features, mute controls, and faster automatic device switching. And with iOS 18, released last month, Apple added <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-airpods-pro/">head gestures&lt;/</a> [...]<br>

            <p>We recently spent a sprint focused on reducing our Snowflake costs. During this sprint, we investigated 22 of our most expensive pipelines (in terms of Snowflake costs), one by one. In total we merged 56 changes, and in this post we’ll be laying out the optimisations that worked best for us.</p><p>Most of these changes were just common sense and didn’t involve any advanced data engineering techniques. Still, we’re always making mistakes (and that’s okay!) and hopefully this post will help readers avoid a few of the pitfalls we encountered.</p><blockquote>⚠️ Medium is now 14 years old. Our team has inherited a tech stack that has a long history, some flaws and technical debt. Our approach to this problem was pragmatic; we’re not trying to suggest big pipeline re-designs to reach a perfect state, but rather consider our tech stack in it’s current state and figure out the best options to cut costs quickly. Our product evolves, and as we create new things we can remove some old ones, which is why we don’t need</blockquote> [...]<br>
