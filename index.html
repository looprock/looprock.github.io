<p>You should stay in De Pijp or the Jordaan. These are the neighborhoods just outside of the touristy part of city center that still have all the things you’re thinking of when you think Amsterdam, plenty of nice bars and cafes, hipstery and traditional eateries, excellent architecture and narrow streets, canals, bikes, etc. And yes, plenty of coffee shops (places to buy weed).</p>
<p>If you want more sleepy, but sill urban with stores and coffee ships and stuff, there’s Watergraafsmeer or the even calmer Eastern Docklands.</p>
<p>But I’d stay in De Pijp.</p>
