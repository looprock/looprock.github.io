            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) has released <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/delivering-on-the-bi-annual-release-schedule-bluetooth-core-6-1-is-here/">Bluetooth 6.1</a> as part of its new bi-annual update schedule. The update introduces Randomized Resolvable Private Address (RPA), a feature designed to enhance both privacy and power efficiency.

<br/>
This new feature makes tracking Bluetooth devices a lot more difficult because it randomizes the timing of device address changes, instead of just using predictable intervals. It also offloads address change operations to the controller device, which should help extend the battery life of the accessory device.

The specification follows Bluetooth 6.0, which arrived in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/04/bluetooth-6-0-now-available/">September 202</a> [...]<br>

            Apple today shared a new spatial video that's designed to highlight the Vision Pro headset, demonstrating how the device can be used to make and preserve memories.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
For the video, two parents, Sam and Khulan, filmed their newborn son using iPhones that are capable of recording spatial video. Sam then edited the footage into a home video for Khulan to watch on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, and the video shows Khulan's reaction to seeing the montage.
