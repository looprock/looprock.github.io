To use Genmoji, open up the Messages app or another app like Notes where you see the emoji keyboard. If you don't already have access to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/">Image Playground</a>, Genmoji, and Image Wand, you'll need to request it here and wait to be given permission. You'll get a notification when it's ready.

            Apple enthusiast @StellaFudge today <a href="https://x.com/StellaFudge/status/1852435351995814291">shared photos</a> of USB-C to Lightning cables in six "unreleased" colors, including what appears to be teal, blue, purple, yellow, red, and orange. He said Apple allegedly planned to include the cables with Apple silicon Macs, but the cables have never been released in these exact shades.

"They're darker, more vibrant, and the normally white plastic has a matching color tint," he said.

Given the cables have a Lightning connector, that means they would have been included with iMac models with the M1 chip or M3 chip, if they are authentic. The latest iMac with the M4 chip comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable for use with &lt;a href="https://www.macrum [...]<br>

            We're officially in the month of Black Friday, which will take place on Friday, November 29 in 2024. As always, this will be the best time of the year to shop for great deals, including popular Apple products like AirPods, iPad, Apple Watch, and more.

Specifically, in this article we're sharing all of the Apple products that currently have all-time low prices, or discounts that are at least very close to their record-low prices. Of course, these are early Black Friday deals, so even better discounts could emerge later in the month, but if you're shopping right now these are all the best prices around.
