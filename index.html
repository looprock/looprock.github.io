            More images of a redesigned power cable allegedly for a future Apple "Vision Air" headset were today shared online by the prototype collector and leaker known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a>."

Yesterday, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/apple-vision-air-rumored-with-new-design/">the leaker explained</a> that the Apple "Vision Air" will feature a thinner design and switch the battery enclosure and several of its internal structures to titanium to reduce the device's overall weight. Most of the exterior of the device will continue to be aluminum, except with a "Midnight" bluish-black finish. Today's Vision Pro is only available in silver.

The latest images of the power cable show an anodized aluminum connector finished in Apple's distinctive Midnight color. Initial pi [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iPhone development roadmap runs several years into the future and the company is continually working with suppliers on several successive iPhone models simultaneously, which is why we often get rumored features months ahead of launch. The iPhone 17 series is no different, and we already have a good idea of what to expect from Apple's 2025 smartphone lineup.
<br/>

<br/>
If you skipped the iPhone 16, or if you're just plain curious about what's on the horizon, here are 17 rumored features that we are expecting to arrive in time for Apple's successor lineup, the iPhone 17 series, which is likely to be released around mid-September.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-04-17 03:26:29-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has seemingly had one of its most useful AI tools blocked from Meta's apps. Writing Tools, which is an Apple Intelligence feature, is not available to use in Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, and Messenger.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Apple's Writing Tools include options to proofread, rewrite, and summarize text almost anywhere you can type in iOS 18. A long press in a text input field usually brings up the feature, but not in any of Meta's apps currently.

<br/>
Brazilian blog <em><a href="https://sorcererhat.tech/articles/meta-impede-o-uso-da-apple-intelligence-em-seus-apps">Sorcererhat Tech</a></em> spotted the lack of Writing Tools across Meta's apps. Developers can choose whether to allow the tools in their apps, so it looks as if Meta has declined the offer.
