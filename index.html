            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-24 05:05:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, Apple has added a new feature to its Home screen customization options that can match the color of your app icons with the actual color of your iPhone's case. Keep reading to learn how it works.

<br/>
In iOS 18, Apple introduced Tinted app icons. The option applies a color filter over app icons, widgets, and even system UI elements. And with iOS 26, Apple has built on the theme with a new option that matches the color of your iPhone's removable case.
<br/>
<br/>
It's worth noting from the off that the color-matching feature only works with official Apple MagSafe cases that include a small NFC chip with color variant information. If you don't have such a case, you might want to consider trying another new tint option in iOS 26 that can match the color of your app icons  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Logitech has announced the <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/signature-slim-solar-plus">Signature Slim Solar+ K980</a>, a full-size wireless keyboard that relies entirely on solar power. The device features a solar panel along its top edge and doesn't even have a USB charging connector, so if you dislike cable clutter, this could be your kind of thing.
<br/>

<br/>
The K980 uses Logitech's LightCharge technology, which needs a minimum of 200 lux of ambient light to maintain power, which can come from sunlight or artificial light sources. When fully charged, the keyboard can operate in complete darkness for up to four months, claims the company. Logitech also reckons the internal battery lasts up to 10 years before requiring replacement.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-24 03:55:24-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, seamless multilingual conversations in Messages are just a few taps away, thanks to Apple's new Live Translation feature. When chatting with friends or colleagues who speak different languages, you can now see instant translations without breaking the flow of your conversation.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Live Translation is an Apple Intelligence feature, so you'll need an iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 16, iPhone Air, or iPhone 17 model to use it. 
<br/>
<br/>
Tranlsation works with nine languages including Chinese (Mandarin, Simplified), French, German, Italian, English, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish (Spain). Your messages appear in both languages on your device, while recipients see everything in their preferred language, provided they are using a device running iOS 26, iPadOS 26, or macOS Tahoe.
