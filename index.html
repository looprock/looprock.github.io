            This week we’re joined by Steve O’Grady, Principal Analyst & Co-founder at RedMonk. The topic today is the definition of open source, the constant pressure on the true definition of the term, and the seemingly small but vocal minority that aim to protect that definition. In Steve’s post Why Open Source Matters, he says “open source is at a crossroads” and there are some seeking to break the definition of open source to one that is more permissive to their desires, and they are closer than ever to achieving that goal.

According to three individuals familiar with the matter talking to <em>CNBC</em>, the feature would have served as a rival to trading apps like Robinhood, allowing users to buy and sell stocks directly from their ‌iPhone‌ in a convenient way.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            RWA is now certainly the hottest topic in DeFi, if not all #crypto.

While tokenizing Real World Assets is not a new idea, lending protocols that leverage RWA are dynamizing their use and can bring it to a whole new level.

In this light, Citi's prediction of $6 trillion dollars worth of RWA pouring into the blockchain by 2030 does not seem so romantic anymore.

RWA-specific protocols are gaining traction, and in our last newsletter, we delved into this phenomenon, looking into:
MakerDAO, which now holds almost 50% in RWA,
Ondo Finance, one of the exemplary RWA-focused protocols, and
stUSDT, whose explosive growth raised some eyebrows.<br>

WhatsApp currently allows users of the encrypted messaging platform to link up to four devices to their account even when their main smartphone is not connected to the internet.
