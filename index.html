            <b>Published:</b> 2023-12-13 04:29:37-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 17.2, Apple lets you customize the alert tone used by your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> for default notifications. This is good news for anyone who does not like the "Rebound" tone that Apple introduced in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924433" height="3108" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-17-default-alert.jpg" width="5526"/>
<br/>
In previous versions of iOS, Apple allowed users to choose a ring tone and a text tone, as well as custom alert sounds for email, calendar, and reminder alerts. Anything else that threw up notifications used a default sound, and there was no way to change it.
<br/>
<br/>
With ‌iOS 17‌, Apple then changed the original default alert sound, from "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYHdfDJrwMU">Tri-tone</a>" to "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjveF8Vtw6c">Rebound</a>." Many users disliked the ch [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            TSMC has already demonstrated prototype 2nm chips to Apple ahead of their expected introduction in 2025, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e9be182f-ec9e-4426-9cd2-d5181fd64778"><em>Financial Times</em></a> reports.

<br/>
Apple is said to be closely aligned with TSMC in the race to develop and implement 2nm chip technology, which will surpass their current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> chips and associated nodes in terms of transistor density, performance, and efficiency. 2nm chips are expected to be integral in underpinning future Apple silicon chips, as well as next-generation data center and artificial intelligence technology. Test results for TSMC's "N2" 2nm prototype chips have already been showcased to Apple and several other key TSMC clients as plans for upcoming chips begin to solidify.
