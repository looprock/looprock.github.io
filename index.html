<br/>
For anyone unfamiliar with the Shortcuts app, the tool lets users create custom workflows or actions – called shortcuts – to perform tasks automatically or with minimal interaction. Actions can include anything from sending messages to controlling smart home devices. The app emerged out of Apple's 2017 acquisition of Workflow, which was rebranded as Shortcuts the following year.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Apple TV is much more private than competing streaming hardware, offering users a rare refuge from the pervasive tracking that defines most smart TV experiences, according to a comprehensive analysis by <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/all-the-ways-apple-tv-boxes-do-and-mostly-dont-track-you/">ArsTechnica</a></em>.

<br/>
The main difference is said to be Apple's approach to automatic content recognition (ACR), the invasive tracking technology that monitors viewing habits on nearly every smart TV and streaming device. Apple TV devices don't include ACR software, and that gives them an immediate privacy advantage over alternatives like Roku, Amazon Fire TV, and built-in, smart TV platforms.

In a research note with equity research firm GF Securities this month, Apple analyst Jeff Pu said that the lowest-end iPhone 17 model will be equipped with the same A18 chip that is used in the iPhone 16 base model. The chip will continue to be manufactured with TSMC's second-generation 3nm process, known as N3E, he said.

The ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air is expected to have an A19 chip, while the iPhone 17 Pro models are expected to have an A19 Pro chip. Both of those chips are expected to be manufactured with TSMC's third-generation 3nm process, known as N3P.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            On this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/last-minute-wwdc-rumors-ios-26-and-games-app/id1602394741?i=1000710566315">The MacRumors Show</a>, we talk through Apple's plan to introduce a complete overhaul of the design and naming system for its operating systems at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).

Despite the ongoing focus in the industry on generative artificial intelligence, Apple is reportedly planning to debut a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ios-19-macos-16-major-design-update/">complete visual redesign</a> of its platforms as "the highlight of the show" at WWDC.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-05-30 08:42:22-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In macOS, a handy option called "Show suggested and recent applications in Dock" (found in <strong>System Settings ➝ Desktop &amp; Dock</strong>) adds a divider to the right-hand side of your Mac's Dock, and after it displays any apps you recently used – or any that macOS thinks may be useful to your workflow – that aren't permanently docked. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="settings" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003600" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/show-recent-apps-dock.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
Assuming that you have no undocked apps that are currently open, the right side of the divider shows three of the most recently used apps that have since been closed. However, there is a way to make it show more, which can be useful if your workflow involves using a lot of undocked apps consecutively.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're comfortable pasting commands into Terminal, it's perfectly possible to increase or decrease the number of recently opened apps that show in your Dock.

We asked more than a dozen automakers about their CarPlay Ultra plans, and we have rounded up their responses below.

            <p>I’m thinking through the topic of ROI for infrastructure software again (obviously for our PaaS stuff). I get asked about this every year or two. Each time I look at it, I get more confused. This ask always come from sales, presumably because the buyers are asking it. But, I don’t think the ask is about the basic ROI calculations: the amount we paid for this tech is less than the amount of money we make using it.</p>
<p>First, that is a very difficult thing to figure out with infrastructure software. What is the ROI of Linux (I guess I mean RHEL), Java, or a laptop?</p>
<p>In each of those cases, the ROI could be infinite: if you didn’t have them, your business would not function.</p>
<p>In other cases true ROI is zero: there is no direct cause between having a laptop and increasing margins on USB cables by 0.5% because your supply chain negotiator could type on a laptop, maybe even accessing the intranet for contract templates with a VPN while they were waiting for their flight to board. But, they w</p> [...]<br>
