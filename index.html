            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If you own an iPhone or iPad with a USB-C port, the port can be used to charge AirPods, an Apple Watch, or even another iPhone, which is handy for times when you don't have a spare charger or power outlet available. Here's how it works.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910412" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-USB-C-Port-Event-Still.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
If your AirPods or Apple Watch run out of battery while you don't have access to a charger, you can use the battery in your iPhone or iPad for a little extra juice rather than carrying around an additional battery pack.
<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, if you plug an ‌iPhone 15‌ or newer into another ‌iPhone 15‌ or newer, the two devices will communicate with one another, determine which ‌iPhone‌ has the lower battery, and transfer power in the direction that needs it most.

            Apple is facing mounting resistance from automakers over CarPlay Ultra, the next-generation version of its CarPlay software system for vehicles that was announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/apples-carplay-ultra-now-available/">last month</a>.

A new (paywalled) <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cdd7c98a-10a7-437c-a85a-68f7f9be2b0b">Financial Times</a></em> report claims several major brands are walking back their earlier commitments to support the upgraded dashboard software. German luxury manufacturers Mercedes-Benz and Audi have both distanced themselves from the system, along with Volvo, Polestar, and Renault. 
<br/>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-25 04:21:51-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is expected to release new iPad Pro models powered by its latest M5 chip later this year, and both Samsung Display and LG Display have reportedly begun mass production of the devices' OLED panels in preparation.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959393" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ipad-pro-new-blue.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
For last year's iPad Pro models which debuted OLED displays, Samsung handled supply for the 11-inch panels, while LG dealt with the 13-inch panels. This year, <em>ZDNet Korea</em> reports that the two manufacturers will share supply for both panel sizes, likely as a result of Apple's efforts to diversify its supply chain.
<br/>
<br/>
The change is also likely related to Apple's need to deepen OLED adoption across its suppliers. Reports suggest plans to introduce OLED panels for the iPad mini in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/2026-ipad-air-oled-panels-supplied-samsung/">2026</a> and the iPad Air [...]<br>

            If you've been following iPhone 18 Pro reports recently, you'll know that there are two competing rumors from usually reliable sources about how Apple plans to integrate Face ID into the display, and both of them likely affect the fate of the Dynamic Island – and in turn the overall look of the display itself.
