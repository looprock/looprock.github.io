            <b>Published:</b> 2025-07-02 17:19:33-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple appears to have joined Meta-owned <a href="https://www.threads.com/@apple">social media site Threads</a>, two years after Threads first launched. Apple has a verified Threads profile and the @apple handle, but has yet to make any posts. Apple's account has 4.8 million followers, because of its existing followers on Instagram.

<br/>
It's not clear why Apple has opted to make a Threads account, and there's no word on whether it will actually see use. Apple also has the @apple handle on X, but it uses the account for advertising and does not share content there (though it does on other specific feature accounts). Apple has a similar unused Facebook account.

            When you're not using your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, the Lock Screen is what you see most often. Liquid Glass is everywhere in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, and it starts right when you pick up your device. The Lock Screen got a Liquid Glass overhaul, plus a few other new features.

<br/>
Here's what you'll see first when you upgrade to ‌iOS 26‌.

<br/>
The two customizable control buttons on the Lock Screen are larger and have a floating, glass-like appearance like the other Liquid Glass interface options in ‌iOS 26‌. The clock has a frosted glass appearance with the new "Glass" option, using lighting effects to make it look like glass in the real world.

            The Trump administration&#8217;s immigration enforcement has revealed itself to be not just cruel, but fundamentally backwards: They&#8217;re literally freeing dangerous criminals while manufacturing cases against innocent people.

            DJI, best known for its line of drones, today announced the launch of <a href="https://store.dji.com/product/dji-power-2000">the Power 2000</a>, a portable power station. DJI already offers the Power 1000, and the Power 2000 is a larger, more capable version of the Power 1000.

<br/>
I was able to test the Power 2000 before launch, to provide insight into the product for those who might be looking for a large power station option.
<br/>
<br/>
DJI's Power 2000 has a 2048Wh capacity with an LFP battery, double the capacity of the Power 1000. It's designed to power multiple devices or large appliances and equipment in emergencies, when off-grid, or when no traditional power source is available such as in a van living situation. It's $1,299, so it's not cheap, but it does seem to be priced competitively.

            When it comes to the anti-piracy efforts taken by some of the more aggressive companies out there, such as Nintendo, the most frustrating part of the whole thing for me is just how completely short-sighted those efforts tend to be.

            AT&amp;T <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2025/wireless-account-lock.html">today said</a> that customers can activate Wireless Account Lock, a new feature that will prevent unauthorized changes to a wireless account. With Account Lock turned on, account changes like billing updates and wireless number transfers are disabled.

<br/>
Account Lock will protect AT&amp;T users from SIM swapping, a technique that scammers employ to gain control of a smartphone user's phone number, and by extension, two-factor verification codes sent to that number. With SIM swapping, an attacker calls the carrier's support staff, pretends to be the smartphone user, and asks for a number transfer.

The man was stuck above 10,000 feet on Snowmass Mountain, which is one of many snowy mountains in Colorado. It can be a dangerous hike due to the potential for rockfall and because of ice.
