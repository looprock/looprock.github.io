References in iOS 18.3 beta 2 spotted by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/08/ios-18-3-invites-app-events/">9to5Mac</a></em> suggest the app is called "Invites," and it will show users a list of people invited to an event and indicate those who have confirmed their attendance.

The app apparently taps into Apple's previously unused GroupKit daemon, which handles database models for groups of people. Little else is known about the app – it could be standalone, or it could be an integration with existing apps. Whatev [...]<br>
