            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Verizon is experiencing a major outage across the U.S. today, with hundreds of thousands of customers reporting issues with the network <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/">on the website Downdetector</a>. There are also complaints across Reddit and other social media platforms.

<br/>
iPhone users and others with Verizon service are generally unable to make phone calls, send text messages, or use data over 5G or LTE due to the outage. iPhone users may see "SOS" in the status bar, as the device cannot connect to Verizon's network.

<br/>
AT&amp;T and T-Mobile customers may be indirectly impacted by Verizon's outage.

            <p>Winning in AI is now defined as having a great chat app, not the AI infrastructure running that app. Amazon (AWS) has no chat app (that I know of, which is the point!), so people don’t think they’re winning. If AWS did have an app, and evolved it as a product, they would be at the AI table.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter that AWS might have the “picks and shovels.” That’s not where the definitional power and attention and leaderboard is.</p>
<p>Analogously, Dell doesn’t define much at all (anything?) in the market despite how many apps and workloads run on Dell laptops, servers, etc. Neither does Cisco, etc.</p>
<p>In new, all-consuming tech categories, like AI, you have to chase the use case, deliver apps for it, and constantly churn out new features. And in AI, that’s currently a chat app.</p>
<p>In contrast to AWS, look at Google. If Google didn’t have Gemini Chat, NotebookLM, Nano Banana…we wouldn’t think they were “winning"AI.</p>

<br/>
Apple said some "exciting new intelligent features and premium content" in Pixelmator Pro, Keynote, Numbers, Pages, and Freeform will only be accessible with a Creator Studio subscription. In the U.S., a subscription costs $12.99 per month, or $129 per year, while college students can pay a lower $2.99 per month or $29 per year.
<br/>
<br/>
This means that if you bought Pixelmator Pro via one-time purchase, which will still be an option going forward, you will no longer have access to every new feature. However, Apple promises the app will continue to receive updates.
