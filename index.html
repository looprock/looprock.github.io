A cartoon version of Cook is depicted visiting Trump in the White House to provide him with a gift, which is poking fun at the glass and gold Apple plaque that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/07/tim-cook-gift-to-trump/">Cook presented to Trump</a> earlier in August.

<br/>
"Mr. President, your ideas for the tech industry are so innovative and you definitely do not have a small penis," said the fake Cook. "Please accept this gift on behalf of Apple."

            The Deebot X9 Pro Omni is the latest flagship robot vacuum from Ecovacs. <a href="https://www.ecovacs.com/us/deebot-robotic-vacuum-cleaner/deebot-x9-pro-omni">At $1,300</a>, it doesn't come cheap, but it is one of the most full-featured automated vacuuming and mopping options on the market right now.

<br/>
I reviewed the X8 Pro Omni <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/ecovacs-x8-pro-omni-matter/">earlier this year</a>, and I've been using the X9 Pro Omni for over three months now. For something this expensive, I wanted to make sure that I extensively tested it before sharing an opinion. The X9 Pro Omni is a Matter-enabled robot vacuum, so it connects to the Apple Home app. It can be controlled with the Home app, the Ecovacs app, or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> voice commands.

            Apple's iOS 26 update, currently in beta, introduces a striking visual overhaul with its new Liquid Glass design language. However, if the translucent elements are causing readability issues or you simply prefer a more opaque interface, there's a quick accessibility setting that can help tone things down.

The Liquid Glass design brings transparency effects throughout the system interface and stock apps. On the Home Screen, you'll notice the search bar, dock, and app folders all feature translucent backgrounds.

Perhaps getting started quickly like this is easy for me because I’ve listened to myself and others podcast for 20 years. Maybe it will work for you.</p><p>If you have a presentation already, that is likely a good structure. Go slide by slide and write out what you would say for each slide.</p><p>Setup a “dead pool” document for text you delete.

The consolidation resulted in significant benefits including 25% base capacity reduction, two times faster deployments, and improved failover capabilities through ARC zonal shift, enabling CommSec to continue serving millions of customers while meeting strict regulatory requirements.<br>
