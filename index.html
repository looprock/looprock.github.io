            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iPhone development roadmap runs several years into the future and the company is continually working with suppliers on several successive iPhone models at the same time, which is why we often get rumored features months ahead of launch. The iPhone 18 series is no different, and we already have a good idea of what to expect for the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max.

<br/>
One thing worth noting is that Apple is reportedly planning a major change to its iPhone release cycle next year, adopting a two-phase rollout starting with the iPhone 18 series. That means the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and iPhone Fold will be released in September 2026, followed by the iPhone 18 and iPhone 18e in spring 2027.

As found in the latest TestFlight beta on iOS, the feature introduces a new "Account List" section in the settings menu, where users can add a second account without needing to go near WhatsApp Business or attempt any sort of workaround.

<br/>
The beta currently supports up to two accounts, which can be newly created numbers, existing accounts from WhatsApp Business or other devices, or companion accounts linked via QR code scanning. Each account maintains separate chat histories, backup configurations, notification settings, and privacy preferences.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-11-19 01:47:43-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26.2, currently in beta, Apple has added a new optional feature that provides the Reminders app with a more urgent notification system. When you need to ensure you don't miss an important task, you can now set an alarm that works just like your morning wake-up call, with a snooze button and slide-to-stop slider.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025665" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-alarm-reminders.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
The feature distinguishes Reminder alarms from standard Clock alarms by applying a distinctive blue color to the snooze button, allowing you to easily tell which type of alarm is going off. You can also choose to see a Complete button instead of a Snooze button on the alarm screen that marks the reminder as completed.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Enable Alarms for Reminders</h2>
<br/>
Before you can use alarms with reminders, you need to grant the Reminders app permission to access iPhone alarms.
