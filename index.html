            <b>Published:</b> 2023-09-11 17:15:27-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            YouTube Music may soon be available directly on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a> through <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> integration, according to code hidden in the YouTube Music app that was discovered by software miner <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613">@aaronp613</a>.

<br/>
There is a section in the YouTube Music app that is labeled "Connect With ‌HomePod‌," which suggests that integration could be coming at some point in the future. Apple has supported a handful of third-party music services on ‌HomePod‌ for the last couple of years, so this functionality is already available with Pandora, iHeartRadio, Deezer, and TuneIn Radio.

The light strip comes in two sizes, one that fits TVs and monitors up to 65 inches and one that fits TVs up to 85 inches.

not in charge work within the constraints set by those in charge, and their decision-making is limited to implementing the goals assigned to them.
