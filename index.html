            Apple this week previewed a new system that will allow iPhone users who update to iOS 18 to use Apple Pay in any desktop web browser, such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and others. The computer running the browser can even be a Windows PC.

<br/>
Any website that implements the latest version of Apple Pay will support this new system. When a customer checks out with Apple Pay in a desktop browser other than Safari, a code will appear on the screen that can be scanned in the Camera app on an iPhone running iOS 18 or later, allowing them to complete the purchase on the iPhone.

            Apple did not mention CarPlay during its WWDC keynote this week, but iOS 18 includes a handful of new features for the in-car software.
<br/>

<br/>
Overall, there is not a whole lot new for CarPlay on iOS 18, with changes seemingly limited to the Messages and Settings apps so far.
<br/>
<br/>
Below, we recap everything new for CarPlay on iOS 18.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New for CarPlay on iOS 18</h2>
<br/>
<h3>1. Contact Photos in Messages App</h3>
<br/>
iOS 18 adds contact photos next to names in the Messages app, making it easier to identify conversations at a glance.

            First introduced in April, spatial Personas in Apple Vision Pro are designed to feel as if they are in the same physical space, and to enhance the experience, the lifelike avatars will soon be able to interact directly with each other using some new gestures in visionOS 2.

Previewed at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/07/vision-pro-spatial-personas/">WWDC last year</a>, spatial Personas allow Vision Pro users to "break out of the familiar FaceTime tile and feel more present, like they are gathered in the same physical space," according to Apple. They feature a transparent background and are able to show body language and additional movement such as hand gestures for a more lifelike experience.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Introduced in iOS 16, Live Activities changed the way users interact with their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. Instead of getting multiple notifications when tracking a delivery or a sports score, for example, users see a single, dynamically updating Live Activity with real-time information right on their Lock Screen.

Starting in watchOS 11, when a Live Activity begins on your ‌iPhone‌, it now automatically shows on your Apple Watch at the top of the Smart Stack, allowing you to keep tabs on it just by raising your wrist.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iPadOS 18, Apple has redesigned the tab bar experience for many apps like Podcasts, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>. Previously in these apps, tabs sat at the bottom of the interface.

<br/>
In Apple apps other than the above, the tab bar appears in both portrait and landscape.
