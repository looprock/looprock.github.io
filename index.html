            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple argues that iMessage is not sufficiently popular to be classified as a "gatekeeper" under EU law, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/137d655b-c264-460f-bbe8-a269f0a3d8ac"><em>Financial Times</em></a> reports.

<br/>
The discussion comes ahead of the publication of the first list of services to be regulated by the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The legislation introduces new rules that apply to tech giants that meet its "gatekeeper" criteria and force them to open up their various services and platforms to other companies and developers.

In recent correspondence with the European Commission, Apple argued that iMessage does not meet the number of users at which the DMA's rul [...]<br>

<br/>
In an interview with <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/apple-vision-pro-developers-interview/"><em>Digital Trends</em></a>, Apple executives indicated that there has been a high level of interest in Vision Pro from developers.

<br/>
While the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and 15 Plus are expected to maintain their pricing similar to the current models, the Pro models could see significant cost adjustments due to their new titanium chassis and periscope camera technology on the larger model.

The price increase comes amid a broader softening of global smartphone demand projected for the latter half of 2023. According to Lin, Apple has ordered between 80 to 90 million ‌iPhone 15‌ units for [...]<br>
