            <b>Published:</b> 2024-01-15 11:27:02-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has readied modified Apple Watch models that "do not contain pulse oximetry functionality," medical technology company Masimo said in a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/699113770/Apple-Masimo-Notice-of-Supplemental-Authority">document filed today</a> with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

<br/>
The filing, viewed by <em>MacRumors</em>, suggests that Apple will be removing the Blood Oxygen app from new Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 models sold in the U.S., at least temporarily. This change would allow Apple to sidestep an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/26/apple-watch-import-ban-official/">import and sales ban on Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing</a>, which the U.S. International Trade Commission &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10 [...]<br>

TSMC chip fabrication facilities will begin installing equipment designed for 2nm chip production in April at the earliest. Apple was the first company to utilize TSMC's initial <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> technology with the A17 Pro chip in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max, and the company is likely to follow suit with the chipmaker's 2nm chips.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-01-15 04:28:28-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Apple Vision Pro runs on an M2 chip equipped with ten GPU cores and eight CPU cores – the same version used in Apple's higher-end MacBook Air models. That's according to a <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1746585308626612655?s=20">post on X</a> (formerly Twitter) by <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman.

<br/>
Apple revealed early on that its mixed reality headset uses an M2 processor, but it wasn't clear until now which variant of the chip Apple had chosen. 
<br/>
<br/>
Apple uses the M2 chip in both of its current 13.6- and 15.3-inch MacBook Air models, which launched in June 2022. Built on 5-nanometer technology, the M2 has an 8-core CPU, much like the M1, but it supports eight or ten GPU cores, up from seven or eight in the M1.

            Anyone paying attention to Apple's Vision Pro headset unveiling at WWDC 2023 will have seen its virtual keyboard demo. The keyboard floats in mid-air, allowing you to input text in your spatial computing environment while wearing the device.

However, anyone planning to ditch their physical keyboard may want to hold onto it for a little while longer: According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, the virtual keyboard experience in visionOS 1.0 is "a complete write-off," and most people will want to use a Bluetooth keyboard instead.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Justin Garrison joins us to talk about Amazon’s silent sacking, from his perspective. He should know. He works there. Well, as of yesterday he quit. We discuss how the cloud and Kubernetes have transformed the way software is developed and deployed, the impact silent layoffs have on employees and their careers, speaking out about workplace issues (the right way), how changes in organizational structure can lead to gaps in expertise and responsibility which can lead to potential outages and slower response times. By the way, we officially let the cat off out of the bag in this episode. Justin has joined the ranks here at Changelog and is taking over as the host of Ship It! Expect new episodes soon.<br>
