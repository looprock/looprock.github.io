            Qualcomm today unveiled the Snapdragon 8 Elite mobile platform, which features a next-generation custom Qualcomm-designed Oryon CPU instead of the semi-custom Kryo Arm-based chips from prior SoCs. According to Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 8 Elite features the "world's fastest mobile CPU," outperforming even the A18 Pro chip in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> series.

The Oryon CPU is built on a 3-nanometer process, much like Apple's most recent chips.

These reflections are about deliberately writing code for 10,000 hours. Most don't apply to beginners. He was clear to mention that these reflections are purely about coding, not career advice or soft skills. If you count the reflections we cover on the show and be the first to comment the amount of reflections on this thread in Zulip, we'll give you a coupon code to use for a 100% free t-shirt from the merch store.
