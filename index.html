            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If you're looking for a great way to capture a shot of an action scene or an unexpected event on your iPhone, try Burst mode in Apple's stock Camera app. In Burst mode, the camera on your iPhone captures a series of photos in rapid succession, at a rate of ten frames per second.

When photographing anything dynamic like sports events, wildlife, or children at play, burst mode increases the likelihood of obtaining sharp, well-timed images.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-11-07 02:39:54-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's plans to release a MacBook Air with an OLED display may face significant delays beyond its original expected 2027 launch window, according to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=31036">The Elec</a></em>.
<br/>

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961301" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/macbook-air-red.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Industry sources cited by the Korean outlet point to pricing concerns and supply chain challenges as key factors behind the potential delay. The high manufacturing costs associated with OLED displays would substantially increase the MacBook Air's retail price, which risks making it less attractive to consumers.
<br/>
<br/>
The MacBook Air is often regarded as the company's most popular Mac model. According to <a href="https://canalys.com/newsroom/us-pc-market-q1-2024">Canalys</a>, Apple's US Mac market share grew by 22% in the first quarter of 2024, a surge that was likely [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.2 beta, Apple has revamped <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a>, adding new options for sharing a more limited amount of information on the screen when AirPlaying to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>.

<br/>
There are now options to show your entire screen, a specific window or app, or your extended display. Limiting ‌AirPlay‌ to a specific app allows a presentation or photos to be shared on the larger screen of a TV without allowing viewers to see all of the content on a Mac.
<br/>
<br/>
In the current version of macOS, Apple allows for mirroring a Mac's display to an ‌Apple TV‌, but there is no option for sharing just a portion of a display.

            Apple supplier Corning is facing a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_5681">European Commission-led antitrust probe</a> over potential anticompetitive practices related to its dominant position in the smartphone cover glass market, specifically in relation to its Gorilla Glass technology.

<br/>
The investigation centers on concerns that US-based Corning may have abused its market position by adopting exclusivity contracts to prevent rival glass makers from competing for business with mobile device manufacturers. The Commission is particularly focused on arrangements that allegedly required manufacturers to source "all or nearly all" of their specialized alkali-aluminosilicate glass from Corning.
