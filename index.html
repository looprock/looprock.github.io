            Apple last week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/everything-announced-may-7-event/">announced</a> a new raft of iPad Pro and iPad Air models, but news about a new iPad mini was conspicuous by its absence.

<br/>
Apple has not updated the iPad mini since 2021, so it is certainly ripe for a refresh, but fans of the smaller 8.3-inch device will have to wait a while longer for a seventh-generation model, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.

The new design rolling out for the Meta-owned social media platform is meant to be fresh, approachable, and simple, <a href="https://design.facebook.com/stories/whatsapp-user-interface-update/">according to WhatsApp</a>.

WhatsApp says that sending photos and videos on iOS is now easier, thanks to a new attachment layout. Instead of a full screen menu, there's an expandable tray for accessing features when sending media, documents, polls, and more. 
<br/>
<br/>
Icons have been updated to a rounded, outlined style, and there are new illustrations with added animations for a "more playful" aesthetic.

            When introducing the new M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models, Apple showed a video of a hydraulic press crushing all manner of creative tools, including musical instruments, electronic equipment, arcade games, paint and brushes, computers, cameras, and more, with the aim of demonstrating how the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> represents all of the tools condensed into a single device.
