            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's motion to stay an Apple Watch sales ban for the duration of its appeal was denied today by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, according to a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/699619677/Federal-Circuit-Denies-Apple-Motion-to-Stay">court document</a> viewed by <em>MacRumors</em>. Apple's interim stay will be lifted as of January 18 at 2 p.m. Pacific Time, the filing indicates, meaning the sales ban will be reinstated tomorrow.
