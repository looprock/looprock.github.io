            A <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-automotive-performance-execution-and-layout-apeal-study">new survey released last week by J.D. Power</a> shows that U.S. consumers continue to prefer vehicles with support for Apple CarPlay.

<br/>
The market research firm's annual U.S. Automotive Performance, Execution, and Layout (APEAL) Study found overall satisfaction with in-vehicle infotainment systems to average 805 on a 1,000-point scale. However, satisfaction was higher among owners who use Android Auto (832), and even higher for those who use CarPlay (840). 
<br/>
<br/>
The study is based on responses from 99,144 owners of new 2024 model-year vehicles in the U.S. who were surveyed after 90 days of ownership, according to J.D. Power. The study was conducted from July 2023 through May 2024.

Ohio is the fifth state to add support for digital IDs in the Wallet app, following Arizona, Maryland, Colorado, and Georgia.

Apple announced plans to add support for digital IDs <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/01/apple-shares-us-states-adopting-wallet-ids/">way back in September 2021</a>, but the feature requires states to implement support, and so far, the rollout has been quite slow.

            Several iPhone 16 Pro rumors have suggested that Apple will eliminate the Blue Titanium option that it used for the iPhone 15 Pro devices and replace it with a rose or gold color. Now, the latest claim is that the new color is actually bronze or has a bronze-like appearance.

According to the Weibo-based leaker "<a href="https://weibo.com/5821279480/Oq4eJxISx">Fixed focus digital</a>," a new iPhone 16 Pro Max color resembles a "bronze hue," while the surrounding frame has a titanium-like appearance.

            The upcoming iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are "widely expected" to support Wi-Fi 7, according to <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240729PD219/wi-fi-7-2025-ai-pc-iphone.html">Taiwanese supply chain publication <em>DigiTimes</em></a>.

<br/>
Wi-Fi 7 support would enable the devices to send and receive data over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously, resulting in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. Wi-Fi 7 is expected to offer peak theoretical data transfer speeds of over 40 Gbps, a 4× increase over Wi-Fi 6E.
