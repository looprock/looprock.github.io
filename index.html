<br/>
Labeling your Bluetooth accessories helps to identify connected devices and improve audio notifications. Apple says that classifying Bluetooth accessories like this can also ensure that real-time Headphone Audio Level measurements are accurate. 
<br/>
<br/>
When using headphones with an iPhone, for example, you can check the audio level in decibels by viewing the Hearing control in Control Center. In the Health app, you can also review the history of your headphone listening habits.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple provides five categories with which to label your Bluetooth accessories: Car Stereo, Headphone, Hearing Aid, Speaker, and Other. Here's how to access them.

<br/>
The system will allow users to enter login details for captive Wi-Fi networks – commonly found in hotels, airports, and coffee shops – just once, then automatically sync that information across their iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices.
<br/>
<br/>
"When you go to a new hotel, office building or gym, you're often asked to fill out a web form on all your devices before you can access the internet," Gurman reports. "This new feature will let you enter that information on one device and have it synched to your other products."

            Apple is considering raising prices for its upcoming iPhone 17 models set to release this fall, according to people familiar with the matter cited by <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-iphone-price-increase-2eaebb14">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>.

<br/>
The company reportedly aims to pair the potential price hikes with new features and design changes to justify the increased cost to consumers, rather than attributing them to U.S. tariffs on goods from China.

This system comprises of diverse sub-systems designed to monitor, measure, and optimize ad campaigns.
