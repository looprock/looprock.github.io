<br/>
Rumors suggest that Apple will update the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models before the end of the year, introducing the faster M5 chip in the device. No notable design changes are coming because last year's update brought an overhauled look, but there are a couple new features planned.
<br/>
<br/>
The ‌iPad Pro‌ looks like it will be the first to get the M5 chip, which is built on an updated 3-nanometer process. We can expect modest performance and efficiency improvements.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is no longer signing iOS 18.6, making downgrades from iOS 18.6.2 or iOS 18.6.1 to iOS 18.6 impossible. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/apple-releases-ios-18-6-1/">iOS 18.6.1</a> was released a little over a week ago, swiftly followed by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/20/apple-releases-ios-18-6-2-with-security-fixes/">iOS 18.6.2</a> on Wednesday.

Apple often stops signing an older version of iOS, usually within a week or two after a new version is released. When an update is no longer signed, it can't be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side software verification check.

By no longer signing a software version, Apple ensures that customers have the latest security improvements and are not vulnerable to known attacks.
