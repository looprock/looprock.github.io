            <b>Published:</b> 2023-07-11 08:30:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Nothing today announced the launch of the Nothing Phone (2), the second-generation followup to the original Nothing Phone that came out last year. Like the Nothing Phone, the 6.7-inch Nothing Phone (2) features a unique transparent design with LED highlights that Nothing calls a Glyph Interface.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>
<br/>
There are additional LED segments in the Glyph for improved customizability, with light and sound sequences able to be assigned to contacts or used for ringtones. The LEDs are also able to function as a progress tracker for ride or delivery services, plus they can alert users to notifications. Design wise, the Phone (2) has a thinner midframe and a pillowed glass back that Nothing says makes it more ergonomic.

            I have met people who enjoy a channel crossing; men who can sit calmly in their deck-chairs and, on arrival, wait until the boat is moored, then gather their belongings together without fuss and disembark. Personally, I can never manage this. From the moment I get on board I feel that the time is too short to settle down to anything. I move my suit-cases from one spot to another, and if I go down to the saloon for a meal, I bolt my food with an uneasy feeling that the boat may arrive unexpectedly whilst I am below. Perhaps all this is merely a legacy from one's short leaves in the war, when it seemed a matter of such importance to secure a place near the gangway, and to be amongst the first to disembark lest one should waste precious minutes of one's three or five days' leave.
On this particular July morning, as I stood by the rail and watched the white cliffs of Dover drawing nearer, I marvelled at the passengers who could sit calmly in their chairs and never even raise their eyes for the first sight of thei [...]<br>
