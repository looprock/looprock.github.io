            <b>Published:</b> 2024-12-06 03:06:49-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            A Brazilian federal court has overturned an antitrust ruling that would have required Apple to allow third-party payment systems in the App Store within 20 days. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-876046" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/app-store-awards-2022.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
The initial ruling, issued on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/26/brazil-apple-lift-third-party-app-payment-limits/">November 26</a>, came in response to a 2022 complaint from Latin American e-commerce platform MercadoLibre. The regulator had ordered Apple to remove restrictions on alternative payment systems and allow developers to market different payment options for in-app purchases, threatening daily fines of $43,000 for non-compliance.
<br/>
<br/>
But Judge Eduardo Santos da Rocha Penteado of the 14th Federal Civil Court on Thursday called the original decision by Brazil's competition regulator (Cade) "disproportionate and unnecessary."

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the visionOS 2.2 update that's set to come out next week, Apple is introducing the promised Multiview feature that will let sports fans watch up to five games at once.

<br/>
The Multiview feature for the Vision Pro works with MLS and MLB games, but other sports like football and hockey are not supported at this time. Apple offers MLS and MLB games through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+ subscription service because it has partnerships with those leagues.

The update adds SharePlay integration so that Vision Pro wearers can view live sporting events together, including multiple games at the same time.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            French company <a href="https://www.polysoft.fr/">Polysoft</a> has successfully reverse-engineered Apple's proprietary storage modules for the Mac Studio and plans to offer more affordable upgrade options starting in January 2025, following a successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/polysoftservices/studio-drive">Kickstarter campaign</a>.

<br/>
The company's "Studio Drive" modules will be available in 2TB, 4TB, and 8TB capacities, with pricing starting at €399 ($420) for 2TB, €799 ($843) for 4TB, and €1,099 ($1,158) for 8TB – roughly half of what Apple charges for comparable storage upgrades at the time of purchase. Unlike traditional SSDs used in PCs, Apple's storage modules require specialized engineering because the actual storage controller is built into the M1 and M2 chips rather than being part of the [...]<br>

            The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-clears-vodafone-three-merger-subject-to-legally-binding-commitments">approved</a> the merger between Vodafone and Three UK, clearing the way for the creation of Britain's largest mobile operator.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-12-05 02:54:54-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Apple Card's high-yield savings account received an interest rate cut overnight, the fourth time it has done so this year. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-892213" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/apple-card-savings-account-16x9.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
The ‌Apple Card‌ savings account's annual percentage yield (APY) dropped from 4.1% to 3.9%. Push notifications regarding the cut were sent to ‌Apple Card‌ users on Tuesday evening. Savings account interest rates fluctuate with changes made by the Federal Reserve, and when rates are lowered, banks cut their APYs. 
<br/>
<br/>
When the ‌Apple Card‌'s savings account first became available, it offered an APY of 4.15%. The rate then increased three times, first to 4.25%, then to 4.35%, and finally to 4.5%, before being lowered to 4.4% in April 2024. This was followed by two more cuts, one in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/25/apple-card-savings-account-interest-rate-cut/">Sept</a> [...]<br>

            Cops just seem to love killing people&#8217;s pets. While this act is often &#8220;justified&#8221; by (often ridiculous) claims of &#8220;officer safety,&#8221; a whole lot of killing of people&#8217;s dogs seems to happen just because law enforcement officers have the means and the opportunity to carry this act out.
