            ERC-6960 is a new token standard designed by the team at Polytrade. It’s a unique way to represent RWAs on the blockchain and support *fractional ownership*. This means that it can break down a single asset into smaller parts, each owned by a different person. It overcomes the limitations of existing token standards that struggle to support fractional ownership.<br>

            Understanding web application programming interfaces (APIs) is essential in various tech roles. APIs facilitate communication between applications, and HTTP is a foundational protocol. APIs use URLs, HTTP methods (like GET and POST), query parameters, headers, response codes, and response bodies. HTTP headers carry technical details, including cookies for user sessions. Response codes indicate request outcomes, while response bodies hold data. Authorization methods include sessions and API keys. APIs often use JSON or XML for data exchange. Different API architectures, like REST (Representational State Transfer) and GraphQL, offer distinct approaches to structuring endpoints and data interaction.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>

First of all, laws like these allow governments to decide which news is &#8220;fake&#8221; and which news is &#8220;credible.&#8221; Those pushing these laws claim they just want to ensure citizens aren&#8217;t misled. But, in reality, governments just want more options [&#8230;]<br>
