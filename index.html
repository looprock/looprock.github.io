            Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models could include a reverse wireless charging feature making them capable of delivering power to other Apple devices, according to the Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/5821279480/Q1sHt7Ij8">Fixed Focus Digital</a>.

            Apple has "considered" releasing a bumper case for the upcoming iPhone 17 Air, <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1959665102313205875">according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

Similar to the bumper case that Apple introduced for the iPhone 4 in 2010, Gurman said the iPhone 17 Air version of the case would cover the edges of the device, but not the back of it. Those bumper cases were made of rubber.

Given that the iPhone 17 Air is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-17-air-details-ming-chi-kuo/">expected to have an ultra-thin design</a>, customers who purchase the device might be reluctant to put it inside of a regular case, due to the added thickness.
