            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Earlier this year, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-announces-iphone-16e/">released the iPhone 16e</a>, a more affordable iPhone 16 model that starts at $599 in the United States.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
While the iPhone 16e effectively replaced the iPhone SE, it is also a first-of-its-kind device, so the release cadence for future models has yet to be established. In other words, it is unclear if Apple will release an iPhone 17e next year.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple only updated the iPhone SE once every few years, and a new report suggests that trend might continue with the "e" model.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-05-03 09:20:43-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's former design chief Jony Ive long dreamed of an iPhone with a truly all-screen design, and his wish might finally become reality in a few more years.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-793993" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/Beyond-iPhone-13-Better-Blue-Face-ID.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-iphone-release-schedule-shakeup-new-styles"><em>The Information</em> today</a> cited multiple sources who said that at least one new iPhone model launching in 2027 will have a truly edge-to-edge display. The device's front camera and Face ID system would both be placed under the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
2027 will mark the 20th anniversary of the iPhone, so the all-screen design could arrive at a significant moment in the device's history.
<br/>
<br/>
As a stepping stone towards this all-screen design, the report said that the &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-18-pro-under- [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's two-generations-away iPhone 18 Pro models will likely feature under-screen Face ID, according <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-iphone-release-schedule-shakeup-new-styles">to <em>The Information</em></a>.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1000481" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/iPhone-Top-Left-Hole-Punch-Face-ID-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
The paywalled report today cited a source who said the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max will have only a small hole in top-left corner of the screen, to accommodate the front-facing camera, with all Face ID hardware moved under the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
With under-screen Face ID, the report said the iPhone 18 Pro models would no longer have a pill-shaped cutout at the top of the screen. However, it is unclear if that means the Dynamic Island feature would be discontinued.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Starting in 2026, Apple plans to change the release cycle for its flagship <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> lineup, according to <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-iphone-release-schedule-shakeup-new-styles">The Information</a></em>. Apple will release the more expensive ‌iPhone‌ 18 Pro models in the fall, delaying the release of the standard ‌iPhone‌ 18 until the spring.

<br/>
The shift may be because Apple plans to debut a foldable ‌iPhone‌ in 2026, which will join the existing ‌iPhone‌ lineup. The fall release will include the ‌iPhone‌ 18 Pro, the ‌iPhone‌ 18 Pro Max, an ‌iPhone‌ 18 Air, and the new foldable ‌iPhone‌.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's rumored iPhone 17 Air model will have "worse" battery life compared to previous iPhone models, according to a <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-iphone-release-schedule-shakeup-new-styles">paywalled <em>The Information</em></a> report.
<br/>

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993585" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iPhone-17-Air-Size-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
In internal testing, Apple determined that the percentage of users who will be able to use the iPhone 17 Air for a full day without needing to recharge the device throughout the day will be between 60% and 70%, according to the report. For other iPhone models, the report said that metric is apparently between 80% and 90%.
<br/>
<br/>
The reduced battery life is due in part to the iPhone 17 Air's ultra-thin 5.5mm design, which would make it the thinnest iPhone ever.

To mitigate this problem, the report said that Apple is planning to re [...]<br>
