            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today announced its <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/retail/hornsby/">store at the Westfield Hornsby shopping mall</a>, in Hornsby, Australia, will be permanently closing next month.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1018892" height="756" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/Apple-Store-Logo.jpg" width="1344"/>
<br/>
Hornsby is a suburb of Sydney, on the Upper North Shore. Apple opened its store there in 2011, and it will close for good on October 4, at 5 p.m. local time.
<br/>
<br/>
In a statement shared with some Australian media outlets a few months ago, Apple said it had decided not to renew its lease at Westfield Hornsby. Apple said all affected retail employees would be given the opportunity to work at Apple's nearby store <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/retail/chatswoodchase/">at the Chatswood Chase shopping mall</a>, in Chatswood, which is set to reopen in October.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 26 adds a new Hearing Protection setting for AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods Pro 3 in some countries across Europe and the Middle East, such as Belgium, Czechia, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Türkiye, and the United Arab Emirates.

<br/>
Specifically, there is a new "EN 352 Protection" setting in these countries. When this setting is turned on, Apple's website says the Hearing Protection feature on AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods Pro 3 complies with the European hearing protection standard EN 352, by limiting the maximum volume level of media playback to 82 dBA.
<br/>
<br/>
When a set of AirPods Pro 2 or AirPods Pro 3 are paired to an iPhone, this new setting can be turned on or off in the Settings app, by tapping on your AirPods, selecting Hearing Protection, and adjusting the "EN 352 Protection" toggle switch.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max models in the U.S. feature an antenna window on the top edge of the devices, for mmWave 5G signals to pass through.
<br/>

<br/>
The standard iPhone 17 does not appear to have the antenna window, while the iPhone Air does not support mmWave 5G, so it is not on that device either.
<br/>
<br/>
All of the iPhone 12 through iPhone 15 models are outfitted with this antenna window, made of glass. However, it was not present on any of the iPhone 16 models, which were the first devices to feature the Camera Control button on the bottom-right edge, where the mmWave 5G antenna window was previously located.
