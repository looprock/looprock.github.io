<p>It’s not easy to calculate the watts and joules that go into a single Balenciaga pope. But we’re not completely in the dark about the true energy cost of AI.</p> <p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="NdgX9W">It’s common knowledge that machine learning consumes a <em>lot</em> of energy. All those AI models powering email summaries, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-67012224">regicidal chatbots</a>, and videos of Homer Simpson singing nu-metal are racking up a hefty server bill measured in megawatts per hour. But no one, it seems — not even the companies behind the tech — can say exactly what the cost is. &lt;</p> [...]<br>
