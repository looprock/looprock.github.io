            Chinese display manufacturer BOE is aggressively ramping up its OLED production capacity for future <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models as part of a plan to recapture a major role in Apple's supply chain.

<br/>
In May 2022, Apple halted BOE's inclusion in the ‌iPhone‌ 13's supply chain after detecting unauthorized design modifications. The crisis began when BOE, facing component shortages and yield issues, expanded the circuit width of thin-film transistors in its panels without Apple's approval. When Apple discovered this, Apple instructed BOE to halt production.
