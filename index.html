When a search is performed, the new option in the app lets users bookmark the search, after which it lives on in the Home tab, alongside the For You and Following feeds.

The feature has been available for a while on the Threads web view for desktop, where users could pin multiple customized columns, similar to the TweetDeck feature that used to be available on Twitter. The new addition for the iOS app is rolling out now, so you will probably want the latest app update installed so that you don't miss out when it arrives in your region.
