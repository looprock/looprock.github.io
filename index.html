            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Netflix today quietly eliminated its most <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926">affordable ad-free plan</a> in the United States and the United Kingdom, raising the price of ad-free streaming options.

<br/>
In the U.S., the Basic plan was priced at $9.99 per month, and with its removal, ad-free streaming now starts at $15.49 per month. Netflix subscribers can opt for the $6.99 per month "Standard with ads" plan, but that price point includes advertisements.
<br/>
<br/>
New customers who want an ad-free streaming experience will now need to pay $5.50 more without the Basic plan. As noted by <em><a href="https://www.cordbusters.co.uk/netflix-pricing-basic-tier-axed-uk-us/">Cord Busters</a></em>, this shift will put more focus on Netflix's ad-supported plan, and it is a move that the company already teste [...]<br>

Hello everyone, in the <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-to-create-a-telegram-bot-to-monitor-your-service-uptime-in-python-part-1-instant-metrics">previous article</a>, I started describing my experience of developing a Python Telegram bot for checking the operability and monitoring of my service located on a remote server.

<p>\
In the previous part, we looked at a way to get instant metrics on demand. In this part, we will be doing simple alerting, i.e., receiving a message in the bot when the system starts to fail. In the next third part, we will cover the case of collecting analytics and receiving online charts.</p>

The Cupertino company has developed an "Ajax" framework for large language models like ChatGPT, Microsoft's Bing, and Google's Bard, and it has developed its own internal chatbot that some engineers refer to as "Apple GPT," a play on ChatGPT. Apple does not yet have a "clear strategy" for creating a product for consumers, says Gurman.

It may seem strange that what follows is more a history of the retribution which overtook the criminals than a circumstantial description of the deeds for which they were punished; but the crimes were so revolting, and so unsuitable for discussion, that it was impossible for us to enter into any details on the subject, so that what we offer in these pages is, we confess quite openly, not a full, true, and particular account of a certain series of events leading up to a certain result; it is not even a picture wherein that result is depicted with artistic completenes [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In the night of the 15th of January 1343, while the inhabitants of Naples lay wrapped in peaceful slumber, they were suddenly awakened by the bells of the three hundred churches that this thrice blessed capital contains. In the midst of the disturbance caused by so rude a call the first thought in the mind of all was that the town was on fire, or that the army of some enemy had mysteriously landed under cover of night and could put the citizens to the edge of the sword. But the doleful, intermittent sounds of all these fills, which disturbed the silence at regular and distant intervals, were an invitation to the faithful to pray for a passing soul, and it was soon evident that no disaster threatened the town, but that the king alone was in danger.
Indeed, it had been plain for several days past that the greatest uneasiness prevailed in Castel Nuovo; the officers of the crown were assembled regularly twice a day, and persons of importance, whose right it was to make their way into the king’s apartments, came o [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            On Sunday, the 26th of November, 1631, there was great excitement in the little town of Loudun, especially in the narrow streets which led to the church of Saint-Pierre in the marketplace, from the gate of which the town was entered by anyone coming from the direction of the abbey of Saint-Jouin-les-Marmes. This excitement was caused by the expected arrival of a personage who had been much in people’s mouths latterly in Loudun, and about whom there was such difference of opinion that discussion on the subject between those who were on his side and those who were against him was carried on with true provincial acrimony. It was easy to see, by the varied expressions on the faces of those who turned the doorsteps into improvised debating clubs, how varied were the feelings with which the man would be welcomed who had himself formally announced to friends and enemies alike the exact date of his return.<br>

            Some royal names are predestined to misfortune: in France, there is the name “Henry”. Henry I was poisoned, Henry II was killed in a tournament, Henry III and Henry IV were assassinated. As to Henry V, for whom the past is so fatal already, God alone knows what the future has in store for him.
In Scotland, the unlucky name is “Stuart”. Robert I, founder of the race, died at twenty-eight of a lingering illness. Robert II, the most fortunate of the family, was obliged to pass a part of his life, not merely in retirement, but also in the dark, on account of inflammation of the eyes, which made them blood-red. Robert III succumbed to grief, the death of one son and the captivity of other. James I was stabbed by Graham in the abbey of the Black Monks of Perth. James II was killed at the siege of Roxburgh, by a splinter from a burst cannon. James III was assassinated by an unknown hand in a mill, where he had taken refuge during the battle of Sauchie. James IV, wounded by two arrows and a blow from a halberd, fell  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 17 and iPadOS 17, Apple has added a new Siri ability that means you can get the virtual assistant to read web articles aloud to you just like an audiobook, even if your device is locked. Keep reading to learn how it's done on iPhone and iPad.

<br/>
If you tend to be put off by the thought of reading long-form articles on the web on a small screen, we have good news for you. In iOS 17, Siri can read them out loud for you, meaning all you have to do is listen.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<br/>
There are a few things to keep in mind when you want Siri to read web content out loud for you. First, you need to be using Apple's Safari when browsing webpages, otherwise it won't work. As it stands, Siri won't respond to read requests in third-party browsers.

Second, the webpage you want read to you needs to [...]<br>

            <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/spectre-camera/id1450074595">Spectre</a>, the long-exposure AI-powered iPhone camera app made by the developers of the popular Halide photography app, is now free.

<br/>
For those unfamiliar with Spectre, the app uses a computational shutter to take hundreds of photos over the course of a few seconds to create an up to 3-second long exposure. 
<br/>
<br/>
Because it's taking hundreds of images instead of one continuous shot, users can hold their phone while taking long exposure images with Spectre, no tripod necessary.
<br/>
<br/>
Previously $1.99, the app's switch to freeware marks the introduction of a new paid-for Pro version, which includes additional 15- and 30-second exposure modes, plus a new Pro icon.
