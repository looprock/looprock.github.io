The new capability adds a simple "Record" button to the input window in the desktop app that allows you to capture both microphone and system audio during meetings or calls.

When recording stops, ChatGPT processes the audio on OpenAI's servers, generating structured notes complete with summaries, action items, and timestamped references. Microphone and system audio permissions must be enabled by the user first.

Sessions are limited to 120 minutes, with the original audio deleted after transcription. It's likely to be a convenient addition for some paying ChatGP [...]<br>

A preliminary ruling from the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) found that BOE and seven of its subsidiaries violated the U.S. Tariff Act by misappropriating confidential OLED technology from Samsung Display. The ruling recommends both a restricted exclusion order, which would block imports of infringing OLED panels and modules into the United States, and a cease and desist order, which would stop the company from selling existing inventories or suppling future shipments to U.S. assemblers.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/08/iphone-17-air-dummy-model-video/">iPhone 17 Air</a> will have a titanium frame, according to Apple analyst Jeff Pu.

<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010921" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iPhone-17-Air-Thumb-2-Blue-Electric-Boogaloo.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
In an investor note with equity research firm GF Securities this week, Pu also said the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will have aluminum frames, so the iPhone 17 Air will apparently be the only new model to use titanium.
<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear why the iPhone 17 Air would have a titanium frame, as aluminum is lighter than titanium, which would be fitting for the device's rumored ultra-thin and lightweight design. Titanium is generally stronger than aluminum, however, so perhaps the material is necessary to ensure that the iPhone 17 Air's thin chassis is durable.

Sleep apnea is a disorder where a person's breathing repeatedly stops and starts again during sleep, preventing rest. Sleep apnea detection on Apple Watch uses the device's accelerometer to monitor tiny movements at the wrist that are linked with interruptions in respiratory patterns. Disturbances that occur multiple times over several nights can indicate sleep apnea.
