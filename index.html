            LEGO has an "Ideas" website that allows fans to submit mockups and suggestions for future LEGO sets, and one fan recently <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/798c9236-c87f-40be-a740-3166f919c8b6">designed a detailed Apple Store</a> that any Apple enthusiast would love to build.

<br/>
The LEGO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a>'s design isn't made to resemble a specific store, but instead uses the design elements that Apple has incorporated into many of its locations. There's an all-glass facade with trees in pots, minifigures in classic Apple blue shirts, and an upstairs area reached by a set of stairs.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-05-28 15:07:08-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today stopped signing iOS 17.5, preventing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users from downgrading to that version of iOS. The update is no longer being signed after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/20/apple-releases-ios-17-5-1-photos-bug/">May 20 release of iOS 17.5.1</a>.

<br/>
It is not unusual for Apple to stop signing an older version of iOS, and it typically happens a week or two after a new version of iOS comes out. When an update is no longer signed, it means it is no longer able to be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ per a server side software verification check.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple prevents users from installing older versions of iOS to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date with the latest security improvements.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            French website <em>Numerama</em> <a href="https://www.numerama.com/tech/1747904-rencontre-avec-lequipe-design-dapple-lipad-est-une-feuille-de-verre-magique.html">interviewed three senior Apple employees</a> about the new iPad Pro models that launched earlier this month. While the discussion did not reveal many new details, it did mention one potential change for future iPads.

<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-952476" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPad-Pro-Landscape-Apple-Logo-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
While the Apple logo on the back of iPads is positioned so that it appears upright in vertical orientation, the devices are often used in landscape orientation with a keyboard attached, which results in the Apple logo appearing on its side. Apple even moved the front camera to the longer right-side edge on the new iPad Pro and iPad Air models, so that it appears at the top-center when the devices are in landscape orientation.
