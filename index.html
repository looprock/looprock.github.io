            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has historically resisted the idea of touchscreen MacBooks, arguing that laptop PCs with the feature are unwieldy and far from ergonomic. But recent reports suggest Apple has changed its tune, and the company is now rumored to be developing a touchscreen MacBook Pro. In the meantime, startup <a href="https://intricuit.com">Intricuit</a> has been showcasing its own solution at CES 2026 that brings touchscreen to existing MacBooks with Apple silicon.

<p>We can all agree that given the option of being worse off or better off tomorrow, the next week, or even in 100 years, that we would like to be better off.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Employees think working from home is fine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hybrid work has moved from novelty to normality, but employers and employees are no longer aligned on what it should look like. More than half of employees (56%) now work in the office full-time, yet only 15% would choose this pattern, with three-quarters (75%) preferring a more balanced approach.</p>
<p>This widening gap signals that organizations face a choice: continue to rely on presence-led models or shift toward purpose-led ones. Presence-led approaches treat attendance as a stand-in for productivity, yet many employees question the value of being on site when work can be completed just as effectively elsewhere.
