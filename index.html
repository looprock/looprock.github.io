There’s a location-related setting that has the following wording:

When you tap and hold on any message bubble, a new "Select" option now appears alongside the familiar copy and reaction choices, finally solving one of Messages' most persistent frustrations.
<br/>
<br/>
The Select feature allows you to highlight specific portions of text within a message rather than copying the entire message. Simply tap and hold any message bubble, choose "Select" from the contextual menu, and then use the drag handles to highlight exactly the text you need. It works across all message types, including text messages and iMessages.

<br/>
The iPhone 16 series drove Apple's performance, accounting for over 55% of the company's shipments in the quarter. The data suggests that users have been keen to upgrade to Apple's latest flagship devices, but older models like the iPhone 15 and iPhone 13 continued attracting buyers across lower price points.

<br/>
However, Apple's latest entry-level edition to the lineup, the iPhone 16e, appears to have struggled to gain traction after its February launch. Canalys analyst Sanyam Chaurasia [...]<br>
