The WH-1000XM6 headphones are the latest in Sony's WH-1000X headphone series, and Sony hasn't gotten better at naming in the three years since the prior-generation WH-1000XM5 headphones came out. Sony increased the price when it launched the XM5 headphones in 2022, and the price is going up again. The XM6 headphones <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-17086682">are now $450</a>, which isn't too far off of the ‌AirPods Max‌ price &lt;a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID= [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            On iPhone and iPad, Apple's screen recording feature records a video of what you're doing on your screen, which is great if you want to capture gameplay, walk someone through a tutorial in an app, demonstrate a bug, or anything else. You can also include a voiceover in screen recordings. Keep reading to learn how.

<br/>
If you're making a screen recording to demonstrate something in iOS, chances are it would benefit from some voiceover commentary. Fortunately, Apple enables you to do this by activating your device's microphone for the duration of the recording.

            Verizon wants to lock subscribers to its network for a longer period of time, and has asked the U.S. Federal Communications Commission [<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1051935705713">PDF</a>] to extend how long customers must wait before a Verizon smartphone can be unlocked and transferred to another carrier.

Back when Verizon purchased 700MHz spectrum for its network in 2008, it agreed to unlock smartphones <a href="https://www.verizon.com/support/device-unlocking-policy/">after a 60-day period</a>. Verizon now wants the FCC to waive that requirement, allowing it to change its phone unlocking policy.
