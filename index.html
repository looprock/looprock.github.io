            <b>Published:</b> 2024-11-08 07:06:26-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has returned to using two 128GB storage chips in the new Mac mini with 256GB of storage, according to a <a href="https://x.com/ohgkg/status/1854859167213011199">partial teardown video</a> shared on social media today. This means the base-model Mac mini with the M4 chip will not have significantly slower SSD speeds compared to higher-end configurations of the computer with 512GB, 1TB, or 2TB of storage, as multiple NAND chips allows for faster SSD read and write speeds.

The teardown video also reveals that storage is modular in the new Mac mini, meaning that it can be easily removed since it is not soldered down.

            Law enforcement officials in Detroit, Michigan are warning other police officers about an alleged <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> change that causes Apple devices stored for forensic examination to spontaneously restart, reports <em><a href="https://www.404media.co/police-freak-out-at-iphones-mysteriously-rebooting-themselves-locking-cops-out/">404 Media</a></em>.

iPhones that are undergoing examination have apparently been rebooting, which makes them harder to unlock with brute force methods, and Michigan police think that it's due to a security feature that Apple added in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>.

            Back in October, Sonos ended its moratorium on new product launches and introduced the Arc Ultra, a new version of its popular Arc soundbar. We thought we'd check out the Arc Ultra to see if it's worth picking up as Sonos still struggles to overcome negative perception of its app.

Priced at $999, the Arc Ultra brings an upgrade in sound quality compared to the original Arc. It can be paired with the Sub 4, which is also new, for added bass. The Sub 4 isn't required, and the Arc Ultra sounds great even without it. For audiophiles, the Arc Ultra has 9.1.4 spatial audio with Dolby Atmos, and it is able to produce sound that feels like it's coming from all around you.
