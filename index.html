            <p>\
If you are a front-end developer, you likely work with apps and websites that need an image gallery. From photo-sharing applications to messengers and note-taking apps to search engines, an image gallery is the best way to show the previews of multiple images on a webpage and let users interact with those pictures.</p>
<p>\
While building a simple image gallery can be straightforward, it’s not easy to create resized copies of all images for all available screen sizes from a desktop to a smartphone. The task becomes more difficult if you need to optimize image bandwidth and reduce the page load time. Scaling an image gallery to hundreds or thousands of pictures with all of these constraints in place is even more challenging.</p>

            “Gentleman Joe!”
“Why, if it isn’t old Jimmy McGrath.”
Castle’s Select Tour, represented by seven depressed-looking females and three perspiring males, looked on with considerable interest. Evidently their Mr. Cade had met an old friend. They all admired Mr. Cade so much, his tall lean figure, his sun-tanned face, the light-hearted manner with which he settled disputes and cajoled them all into good temper. This friend of his now—surely rather a peculiar-looking man. About the same height as Mr. Cade, but thickset and not nearly so good-looking. The sort of man one read about in books, who probably kept a saloon. Interesting, though. After all, that was what one came abroad for—to see all these peculiar things one read about in books. Up to now, they had been rather bored with Bulawayo. The sun was unbearably hot, the hotel was uncomfortable, there seemed to be nowhere particular to go until the moment should arrive to motor to the Matoppos. Very fortunately, Mr. Cade had suggested picture postcards. There wa [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            At the end of the preceding chapter we saw that such entities as relations appear to have a being which is in some way different from that of physical objects, and also different from that of minds and from that of sense-data. In the present chapter we have to consider what is the nature of this kind of being, and also what objects there are that have this kind of being. We will begin with the latter question.
The problem with which we are now concerned is a very old one, since it was brought into philosophy by Plato. Plato's 'theory of ideas' is an attempt to solve this very problem, and in my opinion it is one of the most successful attempts hitherto made. The theory to be advocated in what follows is largely Plato's, with merely such modifications as time has shown to be necessary.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Immanuel Kant is generally regarded as the greatest of the modern philosophers. Though he lived through the Seven Years War and the French Revolution, he never interrupted his teaching of philosophy at Königsberg in East Prussia. His most distinctive contribution was the invention of what he called the 'critical' philosophy, which, assuming as a datum that there is knowledge of various kinds, inquired how such knowledge comes to be possible, and deduced, from the answer to this inquiry, many metaphysical results as to the nature of the world. Whether these results were valid may well be doubted. But Kant undoubtedly deserves credit for two things: first, for having perceived that we have a priori knowledge which is not purely 'analytic', i.e. such that the opposite would be self-contradictory, and secondly, for having made evident the philosophical importance of the theory of knowledge.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The serialization process relies on both the producer and the consumer having access to the same class definitions. When the consumer receives a message with a "TypeId" header referencing a class that resides in a different package than the consumer's DTO classes, the deserialization process fails to locate the appropriate class definition. This results in the "ClassNotFoundException" or "IllegalArgumentException" within the serialization exception. Understanding the root cause of this exception is key to effectively handling the situation.<br>

            Nothing today announced the launch of the Nothing Phone (2), the second-generation followup to the original Nothing Phone that came out last year.

<br/>
There are additional LED segments in the Glyph for improved customizability, with light and sound sequences able to be assigned to contacts or used for ringtones. The LEDs are also able to function as a progress tracker for ride or delivery services, plus they can alert users to notifications. Design wise, the Phone (2) has a thinner midframe and a pillowed glass back that Nothing says makes it more ergonomic.
