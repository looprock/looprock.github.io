            <b>Published:</b> 2025-07-15 16:26:33-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is updating almost all of its built-in apps with new features and design changes in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, including Notes and Reminders. Many of the changes to the apps are visual, but there is some useful new functionality available that you won't want to miss.

<br/>
<h2 id="liquid_glass">Liquid Glass</h2>
<br/>
The Notes and Reminders apps adopt the Liquid Glass design that's been introduced in ‌iOS 26‌. Signs of Liquid Glass are more subtle in these apps than apps like Camera, but everything looks a little different.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-07-15 13:49:42-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/08/iphone-17-air-dummy-model-video/">iPhone 17 Air</a> will have a titanium frame, according to Apple analyst Jeff Pu.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010921" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iPhone-17-Air-Thumb-2-Blue-Electric-Boogaloo.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
In an investor note with equity research firm GF Securities this week, Pu also said the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will have aluminum frames, so the iPhone 17 Air will apparently be the only new model to use titanium.
<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear why the iPhone 17 Air would have a titanium frame, as aluminum is lighter than titanium, which would be fitting for the device's rumored ultra-thin and lightweight design. Titanium is generally stronger than aluminum, however, so perhaps the material is necessary to ensure that the iPhone 17 Air's thin chassis is durable.

Sleep apnea is a disorder where a person's breathing repeatedly stops and starts again during sleep, preventing rest. Sleep apnea detection on Apple Watch uses the device's accelerometer to monitor tiny movements at the wrist that are linked with interruptions in respiratory patterns. Disturbances that occur multiple times over several nights can indicate sleep apnea.

            Apple's forthcoming iPhone 17 models are likely to support up to 25W wireless charging using a variety of third-party MagSafe charging accessories, thanks to compatibility with the next-generation Qi 2.2 wireless charging standard.
<br/>

Currently, iPhones featuring MagSafe use Qi 2, the Wireless Power Consortium's (WPC) widely supported second-generation charging standard.

            Samsung Display will supply Apple with "crease-free" displays for its long-rumored foldable iPhone, according to <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/acBH2tItErAhI2">Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.

<br/>
To achieve a crease-free inner display, Kuo said the foldable iPhone will utilize a metal plate that can disperse and control the stress generated by bending the display. The metal plates will be primarily supplied by a company named Fine M-Tec, he said.

Samsung's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/samsung-galaxy-z-fold7/">new Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> still has a visible crease in the middle of its inner screen, so it seems like Samsung Display would have to be developing a custom solution for Apple in order for the foldable iPhone to truly have a "crease-free" design.

<br/>
The change was confirmed in a draft document circulated within the European Commission late last week that was <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/victory-eu-donald-trump-meta-tax-digital/">obtained by <em>Politico</em></a>.

Notably absent from this list is the widely discussed digital services tax, which had been under consideration as recently as May. The tax was framed as a tool to ensure that large digital companies contribute fairly to the European economy.

            <a href="https://www.formswim.com/">FORM</a> has long been one of the leaders in the smart swim goggles market, with Apple even carrying the company's Smart Swim 2 goggles online and in select stores over the holiday shopping season last year. The goggles feature an augmented reality display inside one of the goggle lens, allowing you to see a variety of metrics such as time and distance, and even heart rate thanks to a built-in heart rate monitor that sits on your temple.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Originally published in 2019, this article is part two of a three-part series exploring Go’s garbage collector. Though the Go runtime has continued to evolve, the performance principles covered here remain highly relevant today. This installment focuses on practical techniques for analyzing and reducing garbage collection (GC) overhead in real-world Go applications. It walks through how to interpret GC traces using GODEBUG=gctrace=1 and uncover allocation hotspots with pprof, with a clear message: reducing unnecessary allocations, especially in tight loops, has a direct and measurable impact on latency and throughput.<br>
