<br/>
The newly launched <a href="https://www.canva.com/newsroom/news/all-new-affinity/">Affinity by Canva</a> unifies vector, photo, and layout capabilities that were previously spread across separate Designer, Photo, and Publisher apps. So instead of juggling multiple apps, users can now switch between the three modes through dedicated Vector, Pixel, and Layout tabs within one interface.

The redesigned app includes a customizable workspace where creators can mix tools from different studios, rearrange panels, and save multiple setups for specific project types. Custom configurations can also be shar [...]<br>

            Apple is building up inventory for its first foldable iPhone in preparation for the device's launch next year, claims a Chinese leaker with proven sources within Apple's supply chain.

According to Weibo-based account <a href="https://weibo.com/5821279480/QbGE4luti">Fixed Focus Digital</a>, Apple is now stockpiling key components for its long-rumored foldable iPhone, which we are tentatively referring to as "iPhone Fold." The leaker did not elaborate, but Apple is likely securing supplies of advanced parts including foldable OLED displays, titanium frames, and complex hinge assemblies that reportedly combine several materials.

The move suggests Apple is entering the crucial pre-production phase, where suppliers begin ramping output ahead of full mass production. Some of these components may have long lead t [...]<br>

<p>Tyler Cowen has many maxims, principles, and aphorisms. One is “Context is that which is scarce” another is “all food is ethnic food” (from his ethnic food website). Sometimes his blog posts bring with “those new service sector jobs.” He often asks the same questions in podcasts (there are transcript of all his Conversations with Tyler episodes), often about someone’s “production function,” how they work. He sometimes says he is giving a “Straussian reading” (meaning looking for the unsaid thing, often the opposite of what is being explicitly said). Anyhow, do a bunch of deep research, web searches, and draw from what you know to make a comprehensive list of these Tyler-isms. Include a link to the source (or just cortisone) and a one or two sentence explanation.

They protect data, enforce compliance boundaries, and underpin every secure transaction. But as organizations move deeper into cloud environments, the challenge of managing cloud security keys grows.   Choose the wrong model, and you might end up with unnecessary complexity, hidden performance bottlenecks, or compliance gaps.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Everyone needs to stop thinking about enterprise AI as a way to fire people and think about how to use AI to make people more productive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/29/forrester_ai_rehiring/">Forrester’s analysis</a> found that using AI for financially driven layoffs can backfire: 55 percent of employers regret laying off workers because of AI. More people in charge of AI investment expect it to increase headcount (57 percent) than to decrease it (15 percent) over the next year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Either that, or start by replacing the executives with an AI. A more retention friendly alternate would be to give staff a month long sabbatical and require executives to only use AIs for a month. If they wanted to be really 9-9-6, make that quarter sabbatical .</p>
