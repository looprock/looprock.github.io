            <b>Published:</b> 2024-09-24 12:33:28-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            It has been more than two and a half years since Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/08/apple-discontinues-27-inch-imac/">discontinued the 27-inch iMac</a>, as part of its move away from Intel processors.

            Apple's latest iPhone 16 models include a new Camera Control button (located on the lower right-hand side when holding the phone in portrait mode).

A simple press of the Camera Control button brings up the Camera app when the iPhone is unlocked. Once the Camera app is open, another press takes a picture, while pressing and holding the button records video for as long as you hold it down.

Within the Camera app, a light press on the button engages a haptic click that also allows for adjusting things like manual exposure and zoom, thanks to a handy sliding interface that operates similarly to a camera dial. This gesture also reveals a clean preview of the scene you'r [...]<br>

            Apple on Monday seeded the second beta of HomePod software version 18.1 to developers for testing, but it has since pulled the beta.

Across the <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2-homepod-minis-bricked-with-os-18-1-beta-5.2437870/">MacRumors Forums</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Earth2075/status/1838336848051015944">X</a>, some users complained that installing this beta on their HomePod mini resulted in the speaker going into a "bricked" state, meaning that it no longer functioned. A few users said they were eventually able to restore the HomePod mini using the Apple Configurator app on a Mac.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In a lighthearted walk-and-talk around New York City, <em>The Tonight Show</em>'s Jimmy Fallon caught up with Apple CEO Tim Cook on Friday to chat about the new iPhone 16 and Cook's love for the iconic Fifth Avenue Apple Store. Fallon – wearing Apple Vision Pro – met Cook with mock disbelief while picking up his new iPhone, with Cook personally handing him the device.

As they strolled to Apple's Upper East Side store, Cook explained that he tries to visit the Fifth Avenue location during every major launch. Fallon joked about Cook's rockstar-like reception from fans, but Cook humbly attributed it to people's love for Apple.

<br/>
The two discussed Cook's 27-year journey at Apple, during which Cook admitted he never expected to become CEO. On the tech front, Cook expressed excitement about Apple Intelligence, whic [...]<br>

            Apple's latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models feature a second-generation Ceramic Shield material, which Apple says is even tougher than the prior-generation Ceramic Shield. Device insurance provider Allstate Protection Plans today published the results of its annual device drop test, giving us insight into the durability of the new iPhones.

<div class="center-wrap"></div>

Allstate tested the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> Max, which is Apple's largest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to date at 6.9 inches.

Apple routinely stops signing older iOS releases over time in order to prevent users from downgrading to an outdated software version. iOS 17.6.1 no longer being signed comes one week after Apple released iOS 18 to the public.

iPadOS 17.6.1 is likely still signed for iPad Pro models with the M4 chip only because <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/20/apple-working-to-fix-ipados-18-m4-ipad-pro-issue/">iPadOS 18 has been temporary pulled for those devices</a>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is working behind the scenes to get ready to introduce Hearing Assistance functionality to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2. The latest iOS 18.1 beta does not have the feature enabled at the current time, but it is hidden in the update and Apple could potentially activate it in a future iOS 18.1 beta.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With macOS 15.1 and iOS 18.1 beta 5, Apple has enabled drag and drop, a much anticipated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Mirroring feature. After updating to the new software, you can drag files from an ‌iPhone‌ to a Mac and vice versa.
<br/>

‌iPhone‌ Mirroring makes it simple to move files from one device to another because it works even when the ‌iPhone‌ is locked and charging. To use the feature, update to the fifth macOS 15.1 and iOS 18.1 betas and then activate ‌iPhone‌ Mirroring. 
<br/>
<br/>
From there, if you drag a file like a photo from Mac to the open <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app on the ‌iPhone‌, it'll transfer over. If you want to transfer a PDF, just open the Files app and then drag the PDF [...]<br>

            With the fifth beta of iOS 18.1, Apple has made a small tweak to the Camera Control button that was introduced on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a>, and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max.

<br/>
When you dig into the Camera Control settings, there is now a way to set it to the front-facing camera without having to interact with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s display.
<br/>
<br/>
To get to the selfie camera, open up the Camera app with a press on the Camera Control button, and then use a swipe gesture on the button to scroll through the lenses. The person icon at the very top swaps to the front-facing selfie camera.
