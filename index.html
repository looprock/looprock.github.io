Search in Gmail has traditionally returned results from your inbox in chronological order based on keywords. That's not great if the email you need was sent months or years ago.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Across 2024 and the early months of 2025, Apple refreshed all of its Macs with next-generation M4 chips, with the exception of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a>. The ‌Mac Pro‌ is still waiting for an update, but it is supposed to get an overhaul later this year.

<br/>
The current version of the ‌Mac Pro‌ can be purchased with Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Ultra chip, which came out in June 2023. It might seem logical for the ‌Mac Pro‌ to get the equivalent M4 chip, the M4 Ultra, but it turns out Apple might not have an M4 Ultra in the works.

When the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> was updated earlier this month, Apple announced a version with the M4 M [...]<br>
