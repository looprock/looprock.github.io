            Google is <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/image-editing/">rolling out</a> AI-powered image editing capabilities to its Gemini app on iPhone, allowing users to modify both uploaded and AI-generated images directly within the app.

The new functionality enables background changes, object replacements, and element additions to existing photos. Users can upload personal images and prompt Gemini to generate variations, such as visualizing different hair colors or styles.

<br/>
All images created or edited through Gemini will include invisible SynthID digital watermarking. Google says it is also testing visible watermarks for AI-generated content. The rollout is happening now and will expand to over 45 languages in the coming weeks, according to the company.

The DoJ wants Google to divest its Chrome browser, refrain from making search engine agreements like the one Google <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/doj-google-chrome-sale/">has with Apple</a>, and share "critical portions" of its search data with competitors at a "marginal cost," including how it ranks search results and query understanding information.

            Apple has reaffirmed its commitment to making chips in the United States as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) begins construction on its third fabrication facility in Arizona.

The facility in Phoenix represents part of a $100 billion investment TSMC pledged in March to make over four years in the American semiconductor industry. The new plant follows the company's initial $65 billion commitment in Arizona and is being positioned as a key node in the effort to manufacture chips for Apple and other U.S.-based technology companies within domestic borders.

At just <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/iphone-17-air-2mm-thinner/">5.5mm thick</a> (excluding a slightly raised camera bump), the 6.6-inch iPhone 17 Air is expected to become the slimmest iPhone in the lineup by some margin. For comparison, the current iPhone 16 Pro measures 8.25mm thick.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-04-30 03:26:19-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            OpenAI has reversed a recent update to GPT-4o, the model powering ChatGPT, following widespread complaints about the chatbot's strange behavior.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Deployed late last week, the update made ChatGPT excessively agreeable and unnaturally effusive in its praise, and the responses quickly became the subject of mockery on social media.
<br/>
<br/>
CEO Sam Altman announced Tuesday that the company had completed the rollback for free users and was working to restore the previous version for paid subscribers. "We're working on additional fixes to model personality and will share more in the coming days," Altman wrote on <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1917291637962858735">X (Twitter)</a>.

            Apple is making another round of leadership changes across two key divisions ahead of its earnings report on Thursday, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-30/apple-aapl-reshuffles-government-affairs-and-music-units-in-latest-changes">Bloomberg</a></em>'s Mark Gurman.

<br/>
The company's Apple Music division will now be co-managed by longtime Apple executive Rachel Newman and former TikTok music veteran Ole Obermann. Both will report to Oliver Schusser, who has taken on additional responsibilities over the past year including Apple TV+ and sports initiatives.
<br/>
<br/>
The restructuring appears designed to ease Schusser's workload as he continues to oversee the Beats brand and international services while reporting to Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of online services.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-04-29 16:53:11-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Researchers at cybersecurity firm Oligo today outlined a series of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> vulnerabilities that impact millions of Apple devices (<em>via <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/airborne-airplay-flaws/">Wired</a></em>) and accessories that connect to Apple devices. While Apple has addressed the flaws in security updates that have come out over the last several months, some third-party devices that support ‌AirPlay‌ remain vulnerable.

Dubbed "Airborne," the ‌AirPlay‌ vulnerabilities allowed attackers to take control of devices that support ‌AirPlay‌ to spread malware to other devices on any local device that the infected device connects to.
