            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple intends to update its entire Mac lineup to the M4 processor over the next 12 months, which will make it the first time that Apple has used the same chip generation across all of its Macs.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-08-09 04:03:02-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18, Apple Maps has gained a new "Search here" button that makes it much easier to find what you're looking for in areas that aren't your current location or when you're exploring any new place on the map.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-961326" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/apple-maps-search-here-ios-18-2.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
In earlier versions of iOS, if you search nearby for, say, gas stations or restaurants in Apple Maps, and then drag the map to another location with your finger, it will usually (but not always) auto-populate the new area with search results for the same request.
<br/>
<br/>
That behavior hasn't changed in iOS 18, but what you now get in addition is a "Search here" button that gives you more manual fine-grained control of the area in which to search. This is especially useful if you adjust the zoom level of the map, or scroll away only slightly from the original search – two instances where auto-populat [...]<br>
