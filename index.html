            Repair site iFixit today disassembled the 46mm Apple Watch Series 10, giving us a look at the components inside Apple's thinnest Apple Watch to date.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Apple used an enclosed case for the Series 10, a move that allowed for a the thinner design without impacting the sensor lens assembly. Tolerances in the Apple Watch are super tight, which makes it difficult to get into.
<br/>
<br/>
The Series 10 has a 327 mAh, 1.266 Wh battery inside, with a soft pouch as prior models have had. Though Apple changed the adhesive in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models, that's not the case in the Apple Watch, and it uses traditional adhesive.
<br/>
<br/>
iFixit took a close up look at the OLED display, and there wasn't a noticeable difference between the Series 9 and the Series 10. Apple tweaked the Series 10 display to allow for wider viewing angles, but it's not a feature that can be seen internally.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-10-07 09:23:10-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today shared a trailer for Submerged, its first scripted film designed for the Apple Immersive Video experience on the Vision Pro headset.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/18/apple-immersive-videos-vision-pro/">back in July</a>, Submerged is a short film that's set in World War II, and it follows a group of sailors that are struggling to survive a deadly torpedo attack. It was created by Austrian filmmaker Edward Berger, who directed 2022 movie All Quiet on the Western Front.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not provided details on the length of Submerged, but most Apple Immersive Video content is on the shorter side. Apple has been regularly adding Immersive Video to the Vision Pro since the device came out last February. The immersive content is in 3D, and is meant to make the viewer feel like they are part of the scene.

Apple Immersive Video content can be viewed in the &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Ahead of the holiday season, Apple is sharing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> ads highlighting the new functionality in an effort to entice customers to upgrade to the latest models. Today's ad focuses on the 4K 120 frames per second Dolby Vision video recording feature that is exclusive to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The minute-long ad shows several slow motion shots, including a wind storm, an astronaut floating in space, an arrow flying through the air, a car crash, and more. The spot ends with the tagline "Hollywood in your pocket."
<br/>
<br/>
An option to capture cinematic slow motion video at 4K 120fps is one of the major new features that sets the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ models apart from the standard ‌iPhone 16‌ models. When recording video using the new 120fps mode, there is an option in the &lt;a href="https:// [...]<br>
