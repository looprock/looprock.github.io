            <b>Published:</b> 2024-08-23 03:57:12-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Instagram has announced a new feature that allows users to add a song to their profile, an update that harks back to Myspace in the early 2000s.

<br/>
Added music appears in the bio area of a user's profile. Unlike Myspace, the songs don't autoplay when someone visits a user's profile. Visitors can play and pause the song - or song sample, since the duration of the music is capped at 30 seconds.
<br/>
<br/>
"We're excited to announce that you can now add a song to your profile, giving you more ways to express yourself through music," Instagram said in a <a href="https://www.threads.net/@creators/post/C--rFylx7Be">post</a> from its creators account. "Your profile song selection will be live until you swap out the song."

To add a song, users need to go to the "edit profile" page and select "Add music to you [...]<br>
