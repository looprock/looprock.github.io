            The popular repair website iFixit today shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJojWO2mE8Q">video teardown</a> of the first-ever 13-inch iPad Air, providing a look inside the device.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The new iPad Air does not have too many internal changes compared to the previous-generation model. Like the fifth-generation iPad Air, the battery cells continue to have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/02/ipad-air-5-battery-pull-tabs/">adhesive pull tabs</a>, making them easier to remove.
<br/>
<br/>
iFixit gave the 13-inch iPad Air a low repairability score of 3/10 due to the display and some other components being difficult to remove.
