            Hillary Clinton has no clue how Section 230 works. She seems to think that repealing it will make websites more likely to remove misinformation (which is backwards). But what law do we need repealed to stop Clinton from spreading misinformation about Section 230 (and social media)? In April, we wrote about some comments from Hillary [&#8230;]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-10-07 09:23:10-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today shared a trailer for Submerged, its first scripted film designed for the Apple Immersive Video experience on the Vision Pro headset.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/18/apple-immersive-videos-vision-pro/">back in July</a>, Submerged is a short film that's set in World War II, and it follows a group of sailors that are struggling to survive a deadly torpedo attack. It was created by Austrian filmmaker Edward Berger, who directed 2022 movie All Quiet on the Western Front.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not provided details on the length of Submerged, but most Apple Immersive Video content is on the shorter side. Apple has been regularly adding Immersive Video to the Vision Pro since the device came out last February. The immersive content is in 3D, and is meant to make the viewer feel like they are part of the scene.

Today's ad focuses on the 4K 120 frames per second Dolby Vision video recording feature that is exclusive to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>

The minute-long ad shows several slow motion shots, including a wind storm, an astronaut floating in space, an arrow flying through the air, a car crash, and more. The spot ends with the tagline "Hollywood in your pocket."
<br/>
