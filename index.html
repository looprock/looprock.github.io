<p id="cLhPan">Yelp is joining the wealth of platforms expanding their use of AI, as it’s <a href="https://blog.yelp.com/news/winter-product-release-2024">rolling out a new feature</a> on iOS that rounds up and summarizes user reviews in a blurb that appears near the top of a company’s Yelp page.</p>
<p id="bV9X8O">The new feature uses large language models (LLMs) to parse through user feedback to highlight “what the business is best known for based on first-hand reviews,” Yelp says. That may include a mention of a location’s atmosphere, popular dishes, amenities, and more. One example (as shown in the image at the top of this article) describes a restaurant as a “retro diner well known for its classic cheeseburgers and affordable prices.”</p>

            Samsung came out with its 2024 flagship smartphone lineup in January, with the new devices competing directly with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max. Samsung's high-end S24 Ultra adopts some Apple-like features like a titanium chassis and a 5X zoom lens, but it also has standout additions that set it apart. We have an S24 Ultra, and thought we'd see how one main feature compares to the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max -- the camera.

It's unclear how widespread this issue is, but it seems to be very inconsistent, with recent reviews showing for some users and not for others depending on the app. We were able to reproduce the issue on iPhones in the U.S. and Canada, but not on an iPhone the U.K., while the Mac App Store does not appear to be affected whatsoever.
