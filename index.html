            <b>Published:</b> 2024-10-24 08:52:07-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The high-end iPhone 17 Pro Max launching next year will feature a smaller Dynamic Island, according to technology analyst Jeff Pu, who has a fairly good track record with Apple rumors. This reiterates information that he <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-pro-12gb-ram-rumor/">first shared in May</a>.

<br/>
In a research note with investment bank Haitong International earlier this month, obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>, Pu said the iPhone 17 Pro Max will adopt a "metalens" for Face ID that results in a "much narrowed" Dynamic Island on the device. He does not expect this change to apply to the smaller iPhone 17 Pro, or any other iPhone 17 models.

While a traditional iPhone camera has curved lenses that redirect light towards the image sensor, a metalens is a thin and flat lens [...]<br>

This expands on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/third-party-default-browsers-eu-ios-17-4/">changes introduced in iOS 17.4</a>, which first allowed third-party browsers in the EU to use non-WebKit engines for both standalone browsers and in-app browsing. Previously, Apple required all iOS browsers to use Safari's WebKit engine, including popular options like Chrome and Firefox.

LTPO refers to a TFT panel that adds oxide to a Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Silicon (LTPS) TFT, which reduces power consumption at low refresh rates. Apple applied the name "LTPO3" to the OLED displays used in the recently released Apple Watch 10 series to differentiate it from the LTPO2 displays currently used in Apple Watch Series 9 and iPhone 16 Pro models, as it replaces the drive TFT (thin-film transistor) with a more efficient oxide-based version.

Apple didn't change the design of the ‌iPad mini 7‌ compared to the ‌iPad mini‌ 6, and it's tough to tell them apart from the outside. The colors are more muted this time around, with Apple eliminating pink and adding blue, and the text on the back now says "‌iPad mini‌" instead of "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>."
