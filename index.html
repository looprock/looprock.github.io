            Apple today released new firmware for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/powerbeats-pro/">Powerbeats Pro</a> 2 earbuds that came out earlier this year.

            Apple today announced that AirPods Max with a USB-C port will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/airpods-max-lossless-audio-coming-april/">gaining support for lossless audio and ultra-low latency audio</a> with a firmware update next month, alongside the release of iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS 15.4.

<br/>
For context, audio files are typically compressed to keep file sizes smaller. There are lossy compression standards like MP3, and Apple's own Advanced Audio Codec (AAC), which result in some data loss. Then, there are lossless compression standards like Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC), which preserve all of the original data. The entire Apple Music catalog of more than 100 million songs is encoded in both AAC and ALAC.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 12:48:32-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the watchOS 11.4 update that's set to be released soon, Apple is making a small but useful change to the way that alarms work on the Apple Watch. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996385" height="800" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/watchos-11-4-alarm.jpg" width="1422"/>
<br/>
The update includes an option to allow the Wake Up alarm you set up for Sleep mode to break through when Silent Mode is activated on your watch, which means you'll be less likely to sleep through your alarm going off. 
<br/>
<br/>
Right now, if you have Silent Mode turned on, your Apple Watch alarm will use haptic feedback vibrations to tap you on the wrist to wake you, but it won't make noise. Some people are able to easily sleep through the gentle tapping of the alarm, but a loud noise is harder to ignore. 
<br/>
<br/>
The Break Through Silent Mode option can be found by going to the Sleep app on Apple Watch, tapping on Sounds &amp; Haptics, and toggling on the setting. Fr [...]<br>

<br/>
While hardware requirements for large language models (LLMs) are typically high, this particular PowerBook G4 model from 2005 is equipped with a mere 1.5GHz PowerPC G4 processor and 1GB of RAM. Despite this 20-year-old hardware, my brother was able to achieve inference with Meta's LLM model Llama 2 on the laptop.
<br/>
<br/>
The experiment involved porting the open-source llama2.c project, and then accelerating performance with a PowerPC vector extension called AltiVec.
