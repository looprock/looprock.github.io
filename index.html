            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today stopped signing iOS 17.3.1 preventing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users from downgrading to that version of iOS. iOS 17.3.1 is no longer being signed following the March 5 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-features/">release of iOS 17.4</a>, an update that introduced app ecosystem changes in the EU, new emoji, and more.

<br/>
Apple routinely stops signing older versions of iOS, so it is not unusual that the iOS 17.3.1 update is no longer available. Apple prevents users from installing older versions of iOS to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date and to prevent downgrading to older, less secure versions of the ‌iPhone‌ operating system.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.4 is now the only publicly released version of iOS available. <br/>This articl [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has begun testing a new AI-powered tool with a small group of advertisers that automatically decides where to place ads on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-tests-ai-app-store-ads-performance-max-2024-3?r=US&amp;IR=T"><em>Business Insider</em></a> reports.

Citing two individuals familiar with the matter, <em>Business Insider</em> claims that the AI-powered tool mirrors the functionalities of Google's Performance Max and Meta's Advantage+, which allow advertisers to specify their budget, target cost-per-acquisition, desired audiences, and geographical targets.

            TikTok appears to be planning to expand into photo sharing via the launch of a new "TikTok Photos" app, according to <a href="https://thespandroid.blogspot.com/2024/03/Tiktok-Photo-Sharing-Platform.html">TheSpAndroid</a> blog.

<br/>
A large number of references to the app were discovered in the latest version of TikTok, revealing some of its functionality, integrations, and even its app icon. Among these, phrases like "Open TikTok Photos," "Get TikTok Photos," and "Share this post to TikTok Photos" suggest direct connections between the existing video platform and the new photo-sharing app.

            Wind energy plays a crucial role in global decarbonization efforts by generating emission-free power from an abundant resource. In 2022, wind energy produced 2100 terawatt-hours (TWh) globally, or over 7% of global electricity, with expectations to reach 7400 TWh by 2030. Despite its potential, several challenges must be addressed to help meet grid decarbonization targets. […]<br>

            Apple recently started distributing internal builds of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> to factories and relevant vendors, according to credible information shared on X by a private account with a track record of sharing accurate details on Apple's plans.

Sent out on an annual basis, VendorUI is a variant of iOS that is provided to factories for quality control testing. Because it has a pre-production version of the iOS user interface that Apple won't publicly unveil until WWDC, Apple is careful about where it is distributed. VendorUI can include references to new features, new settings or changes in branding. Unlike the versions of iOS used by Apple's software engineers, V [...]<br>

            This week we’re talking about DNS with Paul Vixie — Paul is well known for his contributions to DNS and agrees with Adam on having a “love/hate relationship with DNS.” We discuss the limitations of current DNS technologies and the need for revisions to support future internet scale, the challenges in doing that. Paul shares insights on the future of the internet and how he’d reinvent DNS if given the opportunity. We even discuss the cultural idiom “It’s always DNS,” and the shift to using DNS resolvers like OpenDNS, Google’s 8.8.8.8 and Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1. Buckle up, this is a good one.<br>
