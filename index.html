<br/>
In a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/319/">WWDC 2025 session</a> earlier this month, Apple introduced a new API that allows developers of third-party camera apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kino-pro-video-camera/id6472380172">Kino</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/filmic-pro-video-camera/id436577167">Filmic Pro</a> to offer Cinematic mode video recording capabilities in their apps, if they choose to implement it.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple introduced Cinematic mode on iOS 15, and it is available on all iPhone 13 models and newer. Inspired by Hollywood films, the mode allows users to record video with a shallow depth of field and automatic focus changes between subjects.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Last week, we reported that iOS 26 introduces an opt-in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/ios-26-adaptive-power/">Adaptive Power Mode</a> on the iPhone, alongside the existing Low Power Mode.

Apple says that Adaptive Power Mode can make "small performance adjustments" when necessary to extend an iPhone's battery life, including slightly lowering the display brightness or allowing some activities to "take a little longer."

<br/>
Apple has also moved The Parent Presentation to the bottom of its <a href="https://www.apple.com/education/college-students/">College Students page</a>, effectively burying it. When we reported on the marketing campaign yesterday, the presentation was prominently featured at the top of the page.

It is unclear why Apple is suddenly hiding the ad, or if it will return. Apple did not immediately respond to our request for comment.

On social media, some people said that the ad was cringe or gross, so perhaps Apple pulled the video due to overly negati [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is testing new Purple and Green color options for the iPhone 17 base model, according to new information shared by a leaker known as <a href="https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1936061526147776765">Majin Bu</a>.

<br/>
In a <a href="https://majinbuofficial.com/phone-17-new-purple-and-green-colors-in-testing-for-base-models/">blog post</a> today, Majin Bu said that only one of the two new colors might make the final cut, with Purple apparently being the more likely choice.

<br/>
The base model iPhone 16 is available in five colors: Ultramarine, Teal, Pink, White, and Black.
