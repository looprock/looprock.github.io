Users impacted by the phenomenon report feeling disoriented, with some experiencing dizziness from the perceived slanting effect.

            Apple in October 2024 overhauled its 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, adding M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips, Thunderbolt 5 ports on higher-end models, display changes, and more. That's quite a lot of updates in one go, but if you think this means a further major refresh for the ‌MacBook Pro‌ is now several years away, think again.

            Apple released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-26/">watchOS 26</a> yesterday, and if you have a Series 9 or later or an Ultra 2 or later, there are a surprising number of useful new features. Apple could have limited new additions like Sleep Score and Hypertension notifications to the newest Apple Watch models, but now you don't need to buy a new watch to get helpful features.

            The Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 are among the latest additions to the Apple Watch lineup, so how do they compare?

<br/>
Both the Apple Watch Series 11 and the Apple Watch Ultra 3 feature hypertension detection, Sleep Score, sleep apnea detection, speaker playback, an Always-On Retina display, IP6X dust resistance, and more, but there are still significant differences between the two devices. The Apple Watch Ultra focuses on withstanding extreme environments, a high level of durability, extended battery life, and additional features to aid activities like diving and exploration.

            Apple today released new firmware for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/powerbeats-pro/">Powerbeats Pro</a> 2 earbuds that came out earlier this year. The updated firmware has a version number of 8A353, an update to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/apple-releases-powerbeats-pro-2-firmware-7b30/">prior 7B30 firmware</a> that came out in March.

            iOS 26 was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-26-mega-guide/">finally released</a> on Monday, but the software train never stops, and the first developer beta of iOS 26.1 will likely be released soon.

<br/>
iOS 18.1 was an anomaly, as the first developer beta of that version was released in late July last year, to allow for early testing of Apple Intelligence features. The first betas of iOS 15.1, iOS 16.1, and iOS 17.1 were all released in the second half of September, so it is likely the iOS 26.1 beta cycle will begin this month.
<br/>
<br/>
The following new features are expected to be added in future updates, ranging from iOS 26.1 to iOS 26.4. These are only the features that are known about so far, so there will obviously be many others added over the course of the next year.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple recently unveiled the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> and ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max, featuring a new Fusion telephoto camera, a brighter display, the A19 Pro chip, and more.

<br/>
The ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ starts at $1,099 and the ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max starts at $1,199. For the Pro model, this is a $100 price increase over last year's model, but there is also no longer a 128GB storage configuration available for this device, meaning that it is effectively only a price hike if you normally buy this model. In fact, if you normally buy the 256GB model, it represents a $100 price cut.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>The new Use Model shortcut in Apple Shortcuts opens up a lot of possibilities. For example, I like to summarize a lot of pages. Sometimes, ChatGPT can’t get the text for those pages, or I don’t trust the text it retrieves. There’s a shortcut that will retrieve the cleaned up text of a page (as markdown). So, you can get that markdown, and with the new Use Model shortcut, you can summarize it and then send the markdown summary to Drafts. You could open the text up in another app to view, whatever you like, but as you can imagine, I like to catalog this stuff. Also, it can generate a little link to include for my newsletters link list.</p>
<p>You put this in your Sharesheet, and now when you’re reading the World Wide Web, you can get summaries real quick-like.</p>
