            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>For more than 20 years, Etsy has been the destination for human creativity online. Our marketplace is home to more than 100 million special items made, handpicked and designed by more than 5 million sellers. These items and the real people behind them are what set us apart. But while the huge variety of Etsy’s inventory is one of our greatest strengths, it also creates fundamental engineering challenges specific to our marketplace. </p>
<h2>The challenge: Etsy’s unique inventory</h2>
<p>With millions of creative items across thousands of categories – many of which are unique – it’s difficult to accurately capture all possible product attributes, which range from standard attributes like “color” and “material”, to niche attributes like “bead hole size” and “slime additives.” The range of possible attributes and their values is so broad that it’s a challenge even to enumerate them, let alone label listings with specific attribute data.

In a <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/mnbyfW1xgQZ5ia">new report</a>, Kuo said that the hinge designed for Apple's foldable ‌iPhone‌ is expected to carry an average selling price (ASP) of approximately $70 to $80 when mass production begins, well below the market expectation of $100 to $120 or higher.
