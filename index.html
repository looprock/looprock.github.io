            Social media platform X (formerly Twitter) will soon stop showing public "likes" on users' profile pages, the company has said.

Perris found that turning off the flag completely removes the "Likes" tab from all user profiles. His discovery was <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1793047277440815421">shared on X</a>, which was then reposted and subsequently confirmed by X engineers.

<br/>
Apple hasn't changed the ‌Mac mini‌ design in many years, and there are no rumors of a design update coming in 2024. Apple did make the ‌Mac mini‌ a little bit thicker and lighter when it was refreshed in 2023, and that same design will likely be used for the 2024 model.
