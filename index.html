            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-01 08:55:25-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iFixit today disassembled the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a>, giving us a look at what's inside and how the ‌AirPods Pro 3‌ have changed in comparison to the AirPods Pro 2. 
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Apple designed the ‌AirPods Pro 3‌ with a new foam-infused tip, and the design change is mainly visible under a microscope. You can see a small layer of foam at the top of the earbud where it meets the ear. 
<br/>
<br/>
The AirPods have a 0.221 Wh battery cell inside, while the case has a single 1.334 Wh battery. The AirPods Pro 2 had two battery cells inside the case, and the change explains why we're down to 24 hours of battery life from the case instead of 30 hours like the AirPods Pro 2. 
<br/>
<br/>
The case has fewer rare earth magnets inside, but they've been placed in different locations to ensure that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> and Qi 2 charging still works as expected.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-01 08:43:45-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The all-new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> comes in four distinct color options, so which should you choose? 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1018073" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/iphone-air-all-colors.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
With its ultra-thin titanium frame, large display, and glass back, the ‌iPhone Air‌ takes a different aesthetic direction from the rest of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> lineup. This year's finishes emphasize lightness and subtle sophistication, reflecting the phone's positioning as Apple's thinnest and most design-focused device. 
<br/>
<br/>
Both Apple's frosted and bumper cases noticeably show the device's color. The Air's full-width camera plateau draws attention to the device's color even with a case, making it all the more important to choose wisely.

The report reveals that, in early September, the UK Home Office demanded that Apple creates a way for officials to access encrypted ‌iCloud‌ backups.

In a Texas filing Tuesday, Apple's lawyers defended the company's decision to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, claiming it did nothing wrong in selecting OpenAI as its initial generative AI partner. The filing says it is "widely known that Apple intends to partner with other generative AI chatbots" beyond OpenAI in the future.

One of several documents the FCC shared today references an Apple-designed "Head Mounted Device" with a model number of A3416. An included image confirms the device is a Vision Pro.
<br/>
<br/>
The FCC's uploads are transmission tests, SAR test reports, and WLAN test reports, so there's not a lot of additional product information available. We do know that the next Vision Pro will continue to have Wi-Fi 6, as there's no sign of 6GHz Wi-Fi in the testing that the FCC did. 
<br/>
<br/>
According to rumors, Apple is working on a refreshed version of the Vision Pro that has a faster M5 chip. The headset isn't expected to feature design updates, with Apple simply updating the  [...]<br>

The FCC published documents that reference model numbers that do not correspond with existing devices. A3434, for example, references an unreleased ‌MacBook Pro‌, while other numbers are likely for upcoming M5 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models. The FCC doesn't include product names in the documents that it shared, but we can guess based on the model numbers of current devices, and we do already know that the A3360 model number is an M5 ‌iPad Pro‌.

            OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/sora-2/">today announced</a> the launch of Sora, an invite-only AI video app and social network. Sora lets you create realistic AI videos of yourself, friends, and other people.

Sora uses the Sora 2 video generation model, which OpenAI says is more physically accurate, realistic, and controllable than prior systems. It is able to generate complex movements while better obeying the laws of physics, and OpenAI says it excels at realistic, cinematic, and anime styles.

<br/>
Sora 2 supports generating video that also includes audio, such as real-sounding speech, background soundscapes, and sound effects.

Based on the box shown in the video, this appears to be a 13-inch iPad Pro with an M5 chip, 256GB of storage, and a Space Black finish. The new iPad Pro does not have any noticeable external design changes compared to the current models with the M4 chip, with features like a single rear camera, four speakers, and a Smart Connector still visible. At a glance, it looks like the 13-inch iPad Pro's impressive 5.1mm thinness is preserved.

There does appear to be one change: "iPad Pro" is no longer inscribed [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Generative AI agents in production environments demand resilience strategies that go beyond traditional software patterns. AI agents make autonomous decisions, consume substantial computational resources, and interact with external systems in unpredictable ways. These characteristics create failure modes that conventional resilience approaches might not address. This post presents a framework for AI agent resilience risk analysis […]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>&lsquo;JFrog Fly is the company’s agentic developer platform and an MCP server that works with multiple IDEs, including VS Code and Cursor. Integrated with GitHub and observability, Fly provides a chat interface that allows users to query, promote, and roll back existing releases based on specifics of the code (e.g., “Which features were added to this release?” or “Deploy the release that added styling to the user field”). Fly includes an audacious reimagining of the software development process, making versioning automatic and version names obsolete. This makes for a slick demo but may introduce confusion for JFrog clients who don’t want to give up their semantic versions or who need to support back-level software.&rsquo;</p>
