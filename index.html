            Apple in iOS 18 plans to use language models to make <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> smarter, according to <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-boosts-spending-to-develop-conversational-ai">The Information</a></em>.

<br/>
As an example, ‌Siri‌ might be able to do something like take a series of five photos, turn them into a GIF, and send the resulting GIF to a friend, all as one single action. Automatically converting photos into a GIF is possible right now with the Shortcuts app, but it has to be set up manually.

Though Apple's AI chief John Giannandrea is said to be skeptical of AI chatbots, he established a team that is working on conversational AI four years ago. We have heard prior rumors about "Apple GPT" from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>. Gurman in July said that Apple was experimenting with large language models, and some Apple employees have access to an "Ajax" internal chatbot.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Obyte's Blackbytes offer unique privacy features in the world of cryptocurrencies, aiming to protect users' financial information and identities. Privacy coins like Blackbytes, Monero, and Zcash obscure transaction details, enhancing security and fungibility. Various techniques, such as CoinJoin, zk-SNARKs, Stealth Addresses, Ring Signatures, and Mimblewimble, are used by different privacy coins, each with its advantages and disadvantages. However, privacy coins face challenges when transitioning to centralized exchanges, compromising their privacy features due to regulatory compliance requirements. Blackbytes, in contrast, focuses on individual users and devices, dividing transaction data into public and private parts and allowing direct peer-to-peer exchanges. This design ensures confidentiality and makes it unsuitable for centralized exchanges. Combining Blackbytes with other privacy tools can enhance online privacy in the Obyte wallet.<br>

<br/>
SellCell asked over 1,000 iPhone users and over 1,000 Android users in the United States to gather its data. Of existing iPhone users surveyed, 63% said that Apple moving to a USB-C charging port would influence their decision to upgrade to an iPhone 15. 
<br/>
<br/>
Of those that would be motivated to buy because of USB-C, the majority of iPhone users (37%) said they would upgrade because they would be able to use a single charging cable for iPhones, Macs, and iPads. Overall, 66% of iPhone users said that they will upgrade to an iPhone 15.
