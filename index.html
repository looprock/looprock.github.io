            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is running a Summer Deal of the Day promotion in its Apple TV app, offering discounts on movie bundles through the Apple TV Store. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012347" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/apple-summer-deal-of-the-day.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
Today is the first day of the promotion, and Apple is selling The Hangover trilogy for $9.99. The movies are normally priced between $12.99 and $14.99 each.
<br/>
<br/>
The initial Deal of the Day is number 1 of 14, so Apple will presumably be offering a different discounted bundle every day for the next two weeks. The Summer Deal of the Day packages can be purchased from the Store section of the Apple TV app on any platform where the app is available.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple regularly offers discounted movie purchases and bundled deals that are more affordable than buying movies individually, but specific themed promotions are atypical.  <div class="linkback">Relate</div> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            A few months ago, we reported that select scenes in the post-apocalyptic film "28 Years Later" were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/30/filmmakers-used-20-iphones-to-shoot-28-years-later/">shot with a rig of up to 20 iPhones</a>. Now, the film's director Danny Boyle has discussed this feat <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZmTRamLD4">in a YouTube video</a> uploaded to the Apple TV channel today.

<br/>
Boyle said that using iPhones provided "the ability to work in remote places, very quickly, and very lightly, leaving a light footprint."
<br/>
<br/>
"We wanted our landscape to look like it hadn't been touched for 28 years by any human, so it was very advantageous for that," he added.
