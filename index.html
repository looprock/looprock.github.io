            Apple today updated its U.S. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a> Monthly Installment plan to require those who use the feature to purchase an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> that is linked to AT&amp;T, Verizon, or T-Mobile. With this change, the ‌Apple Card‌ Monthly Installment plan can no longer be used to purchase a SIM-free ‌iPhone‌.

All iPhones purchased through the ‌Apple Card‌ Monthly Installment plan are unlocked so carrier switching is available at any point, but at purchase, customers will need to have a plan with a supported carrier.

            Stacking is a three-dimensional conceptualization of web pages, where an imaginary z-axis runs perpendicular to the screen. On the xy plane elements can overlap and the browser needs to figure out which one should be on top. There are three types of elements to consider when it comes to the default stacking order: the root, non-positioned, and positioned elements. The root element goes at the bottom of this imaginary stack, then the non-positioned elements, and finally the positioned elements.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has already left an indelible mark on various industries. As technology matures, we can expect a shift towards films entirely created by AI, albeit directed by humans. These AI-created films could feature avatars and voices of famous actors, paving the way for entirely AI-generated star actors.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Reliable UDP (RUDP) combines TCP's reliability with UDP's efficiency. RUDP overcomes UDP's drawbacks like data loss and order changes by methods like error checking, retransmission, and sequence management. It's faster than TCP, ensuring reliable packet delivery while preserving order. Not a standard protocol, RUDP requires implementation according to its specs or using libraries like LiteNetLib, Ruffles, Hazel Networking, ENet-CSharp, kcp2k, or Unity Transport Package. The article provides RUDP client and server code examples using C# in Unity. The next article will delve into challenges in connecting devices globally despite available protocols and libraries.<br>
