Version 1.7 of the app now allows players to compete against each other in classic DS titles like <em>Mario Kart DS</em>, <em>Bomberman</em>, and <em>Animal Crossing</em>.

Nintendo officially shut down the original DS online services back in 2014, so Delta relies on alternative Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection servers maintained by the community. The way it works is very straightforward – simply select your preferred server within the emulator settings. No complex DNS or network configuration is required.

<br/>
The health sensor on the prototype has a smaller array of LEDs compared to actual Apple Watch Series 10 models that launched last year. There is also an extra ring of lights around the sensor's perimeter, but it is unclear what it is for.

The prototype was running an internal build of watchOS 11.1 that was never released to the public, according to @StellaFudge.

            Apple this week began testing iOS 18.6, according to our website's visitor logs, which have been a reliable indicator of upcoming iOS versions. The update is currently limited to Apple's software engineers, with no developer or public beta available yet.

The first iOS 18.6 beta will likely be made available in May or June, and the update should be released to the general public before the end of July.
<br/>
<br/>
It is still too early to know what new features and changes will be introduced in iOS 18.6, if any. iOS 17.6 and iOS 16.6 had only bug fixes and security patches, but earlier updates like iOS 13.6, iOS 14.6, and iOS 15.6 included some new features.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>In the past, sellers were responsible for managing and fulfilling their own tax obligations. 
However, more and more jurisdictions are now requiring marketplaces such as Etsy to collect the tax from buyers and remit the tax to the relevant authorities. Etsy now plays an active role in collecting tax from buyers and remitting it all over the world. In this post, I will walk you through our tax calculation infrastructure and how we adapted to the ongoing increase in traffic and business needs over the years.</p>
<p><strong>The tax calculation workflow</strong></p>
<p>We determine tax whenever a buyer adds an item to their Etsy shopping cart. The tax determination is based on buyer and seller location and product category, and a set of tax rules and mappings. To handle the details of these calculations we partner with Vertex, and issue a call to their <a href="https://www.vertexinc.com/">tax engine</a> via the Quotation Request API to get the right amount to show in our buyer's cart. </p>

However, as we expanded our set of personalization algorithms to meet increasing business needs, maintenance of the recommender system became quite costly.
