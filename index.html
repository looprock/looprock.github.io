            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Samsung <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/26/samsung-new-galaxy-z-foldable-smartphones/">in July introduced</a> its latest tablet offering, the 14.6-inch Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra. This is Samsung's best and biggest tablet to date, so we thought we'd see how it compares to the 12.9-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>.

<br/>
At 14.6 inches, The Tab S9 Ultra is notably bigger than the ‚ÄåiPad Pro‚Äå, and it has an impressive OLED display with deep blacks and rich colors. Apple is using mini-LED for the latest ‚ÄåiPad Pro‚Äå and there are rumors that it will transition to OLED, but Apple hasn't made it there yet.

Suppliers, including Tianma, are currently seeking to obtain orders from Apple for AMOLED panels suitable for the fourth-generation ‚ÄåiPhone SE‚Äå. Tianma would be a secondary supplier, since a bigger manufacturer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/iphone-se-4-oled-panel-supplier-boe/">like BOE</a> is likely to take the lion's share of orders. Apple staff responsible for panel procurement reportedly visited several major OLED panel factories in China in the first half of 2023 in relation to the ‚ÄåiPhone SE‚Äå.

Twitter user Michael Miraflor said that five people related to his brother's girlfriend were caught in a vehicle in Maui after the wildfires surrounded them. There was no cell service available at their location, so they used Emergency SOS to communicate with first responders.

Miraflor shared a screenshot of the entire Emergency SOS text chain, giving us a look at the local fire department and dispatchers in action. The family was located at the Outlets of Maui, a shopping mall in Lahaina where the fires are located.
