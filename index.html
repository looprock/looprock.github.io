            <b>Published:</b> 2024-08-06 08:46:58-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is preparing to release a minor iOS 17.6.1 update for the iPhone, according to a post shared today by an anonymous leaker on X, formerly known as Twitter. The leaker has a private account, so we are not identifying it or linking to it, but they have proven to be a consistently accurate source for upcoming iOS updates.

<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> can independently confirm that Apple is internally testing an iOS 17.6.1 update, which is present in our analytics logs. 
<br/>

Nothing is known about iOS 17.6.1, beyond the leaker claiming that the update will have a build number of 21G93. However, the update will almost certainly be a minor one, especially given that Apple is focused on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/ios-18-beta-5-features/">iOS 18</a> and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/20 [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today stopped signing iOS 17.5.1, preventing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users from downgrading to that version of iOS. The update is no longer being signed after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/apple-releases-ios-17-6/">July 29 release of iOS 17.6</a>.

<br/>
Apple often stops signing an older version of iOS, usually within a week or two after a new version is released. When an update is no longer signed, it can't be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side software verification check.

This policy encourages users to keep their operating systems up to date, ensuring they have the latest security enhancements.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple TV users will soon be able to AirDrop web links in the menu interface to their iPhone or iPad, thanks to a new feature included in the latest tvOS 18 developer beta.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-870258" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/apple-tv-4k-yellow-bg-feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
As Apple TV owners will know, it is not possible to browse the web on the set-top box, so web links are not something you traditionally come across in the tvOS interface. That looks set to change with tvOS 18.
<br/>
<br/>
In the Apple TV app, Apple is promoting Immersive Videos for Apple Vision Pro, and these include a new button in the description screen that when pressed AirDrops a web link to the user's nearby iOS device.  The feature was discovered by Sigmund Judge in the fifth beta of tvOS 18 that was released to developers on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/apple-seeds-tvos-18-beta-5-to-developers/">Monday</a>.
