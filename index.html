            iOS 18.3 is the third major update to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> operating system, and while it isn't as feature rich as iOS 18.1 or iOS 18.2, there are some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> changes worth knowing about, as well as as some other tweaks, bug fixes, and security updates.

This guide covers everything new in iOS 18.3.

<h2 id="apple_intelligence">Apple Intelligence</h2>
<br/>
After updating to iOS 18.3, ‌Apple Intelligence‌ is an opt-out feature, not an opt-in feature. If you didn't have ‌Apple Intelligence‌ turned on, it's now turned on automatically, and you will need to go to the ‌Apple Intelligence‌ section of the Settings app to turn it off.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is reportedly developing a version of visionOS – its operating system for Apple Vision Pro – that will work with smart glasses, as part of continuing efforts to expand its AR product lineup beyond a cumbersome headset with something that has wider appeal.

According to <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman, the Vision Pro has so far been a flop. Many users find the $3,500 headset too heavy for extended use, expensive, and prone to overheating, relegating it to niche status.
