            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            There are several ways you can take screenshots on a Mac. Preview offers the option from its File menu. There's also a little screen capture app in the macOS Utilities folder called Screenshot. But the simplest and most common method is to use your Mac's built-in shortcut key combinations. 
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Taking a screenshot is as easy as hitting <strong>Shift-Command-3</strong> to capture the whole screen, or <strong>Shift-Command-4</strong> to capture a portion of the screen using the mouse cursor as a crosshair selection tool (a tap of the spacebar also turns it into a camera for capturing windows). 
<br/>
<br/>
Screenshots taken using key shortcuts are typically saved on your desktop. However, if you tack the <strong>Control</strong> key onto either of these shortcuts, macOS will copy the captured image to the clipboard instead of sa [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-02 07:11:42-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If you have ever used an Apple TV, you are likely familiar with the device's linear keyboard, which can be tedious to use if you have a lot of text to enter.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003836" height="1082" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/Apple-TV-Linear-Keyboard-Layout.png" width="1920"/>
<br/>
Fortunately, if you are tired of swiping back and forth while entering a long password, the keyboard's layout can easily be changed. To do so, open the Settings app on the Apple TV, select General → Keyboard Layout, and choose Grid instead of Linear.
<br/>
<br/>
The on-screen keyboard will then have a square layout by default.

For anyone unfamiliar with the Shortcuts app, the tool lets users create custom workflows or actions – called shortcuts – to perform tasks automatically or with minimal interaction.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Apple TV is much more private than competing streaming hardware, offering users a rare refuge from the pervasive tracking that defines most smart TV experiences, according to a comprehensive analysis by <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/all-the-ways-apple-tv-boxes-do-and-mostly-dont-track-you/">Ars Technica</a></em>.

<br/>
The main difference is said to be Apple's approach to automatic content recognition (ACR), the invasive tracking technology that monitors viewing habits on nearly every smart TV and streaming device. Apple TV devices don't include ACR software, and that gives them an immediate privacy advantage over alternatives like Roku, Amazon Fire TV, and built-in, smart TV platforms.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            All four iPhone 17 models will adopt metalens technology for Face ID, according to Jeff Pu, an Apple analyst at equity research firm GF Securities. He revealed this information in an investor research note earlier this month.

<br/>
In a research note with equity research firm GF Securities this month, Apple analyst Jeff Pu said that the lowest-end iPhone 17 model will be equipped with the same A18 chip that is used in the iPhone 16 base model. The chip will continue to be manufactured with TSMC's second-generation 3nm process, known as N3E, he said.
<br/>
<br/>
The ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air is expected to have an A19 chip, while the iPhone 17 Pro models are expected to have an A19 Pro chip. Both of those chips are expected to be manufactured with TSMC's third-generation 3nm process, known as N3P.

Pu also expects the iPhone 17 to be equipped with 8GB of RAM, matching the iPhone 16.

If you narrow down to “enterprises” (let’s say organization that have 5,000, even 10,000 employees), my sense is that the number goes way up, maybe 70%.</p><p>The way I think about the question “how much private cloud is there?” is “where are all the applications and services running.” I think most people think of that question in terms of revenue, market-share - a way of thinking that my 401(k) is <em>way into</em> as a sense-making tool, but doesn’t reflect how people should make strategic choices in IT.</p><p>And, yes, I’m <em>obviously</em> biased, swimming around in big, C.R.E.A.M-y pools of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">WYSIATI</a>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>I’m thinking through the topic of ROI for infrastructure software again (obviously for our PaaS stuff). I get asked about this every year or two. Each time I look at it, I get more confused. This ask always come from sales, presumably because the buyers are asking it. But, I don’t think the ask is about the basic ROI calculations: the amount we paid for this tech is less than the amount of money we make using it.</p>
<p>First, that is a very difficult thing to figure out with infrastructure software. What is the ROI of Linux (I guess I mean RHEL), Java, or a laptop?</p>
<p>In each of those cases, the ROI could be infinite: if you didn’t have them, your business would not function.</p>
<p>In other cases true ROI is zero: there is no direct cause between having a laptop and increasing margins on USB cables by 0.5% because your supply chain negotiator could type on a laptop, maybe even accessing the intranet for contract templates with a VPN while they were waiting for their flight to board. But, they w</p> [...]<br>
