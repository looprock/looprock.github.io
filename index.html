            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            An apparent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnzkC2q-iGI">unboxing video</a> for an unannounced iPad Pro with the M5 chip was uploaded to YouTube today by Russian channel Wylsacom.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The same YouTube account <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/alleged-m4-macbook-pro-unboxing-video/">leaked the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 chip</a> before it was announced by Apple last year, so this is likely a legitimate leak.
<br/>
<br/>
Based on the box shown in the video, this appears to be a 13-inch iPad Pro with an M5 chip, 256GB of storage, and a Space Black finish. The new iPad Pro does not have any noticeable external design changes compared to the current models with the M4 chip.
<br/>
<br/>
Based on the <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/14173685">Geekbench 6 benchmark result</a> shown in the video, the M5 chip offers up to 12% faster multi-core CPU performance compared to the M4 chip in the iPad Pro. The result also shows this [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today added the iPhone 11 Pro Max to its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102772">vintage products list</a>. However, the iPhone 11 Pro was not added to the list yet, which suggests that Apple continued distributing that model to select third-party resellers for longer.

<br/>
Despite being vintage now, the iPhone 11 Pro Max is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/ios-26-supports-iphone-11-and-newer/">still compatible with iOS 26</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
All models of the Apple Watch Series 3 were also added to Apple's vintage products list today, a little more than eight years after the device launched.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Logitech today announced an updated version of its MX Master series mouse, the <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/mx-master-4">MX Master 4</a>, which features haptic feedback and introduces a few other changes while remaining largely faithful to the original design.

<br/>
Apart from cleaner-looking frosted buttons and a more minimalist bottom, the MX Master 4 looks very similar to the S3. The feel is, however, slightly different – the new model swaps its predecessor's soft, ribbed finish for a smooth, hard-plastic body and buttons, although there is some softer material around the right-hand side and on the surface where you rest your thumb.

<br/>
The new haptic feedback delivers subtle vibrations near the thumb for scrolling, navigation, and selection. Haptics also accompany gestures and shortcuts accessed [...]<br>

Sleep apnea is a condition in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep, often leading to poor rest. The Apple Watch detects signs of the disorder by using its accelerometer to track subtle wrist movements associated with irregular breathing patterns. When these disturbances occur repeatedly across several nights, the watch can flag a potential case of sleep apnea.

The feature is supported on the Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, Series 11, Apple Watch Ultra 2, and Apple Watch Ultra 3, and is available in more than 150 countries world [...]<br>

            <p>&lsquo;JFrog Fly is the company’s agentic developer platform and an MCP server that works with multiple IDEs, including VS Code and Cursor. Integrated with GitHub and observability, Fly provides a chat interface that allows users to query, promote, and roll back existing releases based on specifics of the code (e.g., “Which features were added to this release?” or “Deploy the release that added styling to the user field”). Fly includes an audacious reimagining of the software development process, making versioning automatic and version names obsolete. This makes for a slick demo but may introduce confusion for JFrog clients who don’t want to give up their semantic versions or who need to support back-level software.&rsquo;</p>

The Claude apps now support code execution and file creation for making spreadsheets, slides, and documents directly in the conversation. Claude for Chrome is available as well, with Anthropic allowing some Max users to beta test the feature. There's also a Claude Agent SDK that's ava [...]<br>

The idea is to race with head movements, tilting your head left or right to steer and dodge cars. RidePods uses the motion sensors that are built into the AirPods to detect head movements.

RidePods is a hands-free game, so like an endless runner, the motorcycle propels itself while the player controls the steering and dodging oncoming traffic. The idea is to get the highest score possible.
<br/>
<br/>
To play the game, users will need earbuds with motion sensors, like the AirPods Pro, Pro 2, or Pro 3. The third-generation AirPods and later also work, as do the &lt; [...]<br>

            Our mad, idiot king recently declared war on Tylenol. Nobody really knows why, exactly.
