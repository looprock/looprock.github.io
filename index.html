            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is reportedly working on a new Magic Mouse. Below, we recap what to expect.

<br/>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-28 05:28:30-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            An iPhone sculpted from a single seamless sheet of glass... It's a vision that was once pursued by former Apple design chief Jony Ive. While the dream was never realized, Apple could take its first tangible step toward it with an all-glass Apple Watch. Or at least that's what one leaker has today suggested. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-965089" height="898" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-Jet-Black.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
According to the Weibo account <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/PkEqB8dkU">Instant Digital</a>, before an all-glass iPhone ever hits the market, we could see an Apple Watch with a touch-interactive, fully-glass frame that blurs the boundaries between screen and enclosure. 
<br/>
<br/>
The Chinese leaker provided no evidence to back their claim. However, the concept appears in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/18/apple-researching-all-glass-designs/">existing Apple patents</a> that describe we [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-28 04:12:11-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Instagram has introduced a new fast-forward feature for Reels that allows users to speed through videos by holding down on either edge of the screen. The action plays content at double speed, similar to a feature already available on TikTok.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786417" height="1266" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Instagram-Feature-1.jpg" width="2250"/>
<br/>
The Meta-owned platform initially limited Reels to 15-second clips but has since expanded the maximum duration to three minutes, making playback controls increasingly necessary for users who want to quickly navigate through longer content.
<br/>
<br/>
To use the new feature, simply press and hold on the right or left side of their screen while watching a Reel. The video will then play at 2x speed, enabling you to skip to the parts that interest you most.
<br/>

Instagram users have become accustomed to consuming quick, bite-sized content, so the ability to fast-forward increa [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-28 03:44:46-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's upcoming "iPhone Fold" will feature a foldable screen with a 4:3 aspect ratio, according to a Chinese leaker who previously leaked the book-style device's display dimensions.
<br/>

<br/>
The Weibo-based account <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PkBXPoR6V">Digital Chat Station</a> claims that Apple will adopt a "roughly" 4:3 aspect ratio on the inner display in order to achieve consistency between the outer display, as well as to ensure parity with existing iPad software.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple's iPad and iPad Pro models have maintained a 4:3 aspect ratio across generations. The ratio offers a balanced experience in both portrait and landscape orientation, making it particularly versatile for reading/browsing and split-screen multitasking. Only the 8.3-inch iPad mini has deviated from the traditional ratio, [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In the mid-to-late 2000s, Facebook was all about staying connected with friends and family. However, as the social media platform added new features and grew over time, that core experience began to get drowned out.

<br/>
That changes starting now, according to Meta, which today <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/03/bringing-magic-of-friends-back-to-facebook/">introduced</a> a new feature that will "bring back the joy" of classic Facebook.
<br/>
<br/>
Specifically, Meta has redesigned the Friends tab on Facebook to focus on the "magic of friends." The page now shows content from only your Facebook friends, with no recommended content or other distractions. The tab will show your friends' posts, reels, birthdays, and more, and it will continue to show your friend requests too.
