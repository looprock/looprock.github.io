            Apple this week <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">updated its website</a> to confirm that the first U.S. vehicle models with next-generation CarPlay support will debut in 2024, but it did not provide a more specific timeframe, or indicate when availability will begin in other countries.

<br/>
In a next-generation CarPlay section of its website, Apple replaced "Vehicle announcements coming in late 2023" with "First models arrive in 2024."
<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-beta-1/">first beta of iOS 17.4</a> released today references eight new CarPlay apps, as discovered by <em>MacRumors</em> contributors <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1750666693251051812">Aaron Perris</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/stevemoser">Steve Moser</a>:<ul><li><strong>Auto </strong></li></ul> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today introduced the first betas of iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4 to developers, bringing some radical updates to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> in Europe. Most of the big changes will only impact EU users, but there are also updates in the operating system that are available worldwide.

<br/>
In this article, we've rounded up everything new in iOS 17.4 beta 1. 
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>EU Changes</h2>
<br/>
Apple implemented several major changes to the way the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> and apps operate in the European Union in order to comply with the Digital Markets Act. These changes are included in iOS 17.4, but are generally limited to countries that are in the European Union.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            App developers in the European Union who choose to opt in to Apple's new business terms must pay an €0.50 "<a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/core-technology-fee/">Core Technology Fee</a>" or CTF for every app install over one million installs, a model that has the potential to bankrupt free or freemium app developers.

<br/>
Apple does not charge for the first one million "first annual installs" per iOS account each year, but after that, developers will begin racking up charges. A free or freemium app that goes "viral" and is downloaded more than one million times could be forced to pay astronomical fees, as <a href="https://mastodon.social/@stroughtonsmith/111818345294643786">demonstrated in estimates</a> shared by developer Steve Troughton-Smith.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apps that are distributed through alternative app stores in EU countries will need to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu#ios-app-eu">submit to a notarization process</a> that's similar to the notarization process for Mac apps. According to Apple, Notarization applies to all apps, and it is a process focused on privacy, security, and maintaining device integrity.

<br/>
Apple is aiming to ensure that apps do not have viruses, malware, or other security threats, and that they function as promised without exposing users to "egregious fraud."
<br/>
<br/>
Notarization will check for the following:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong> - Apps are required to accurately represent the developer, capabilities, and costs to users.</li>

<p id="37DA8M">When OpenAI announced other people could build their own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23948957/openai-chatgpt-gpt-custom-developer-platform">custom versions of ChatGPT-style chatbots</a>, I was initially only interested in a journalistic way. I knew this was an interesting commercial step for OpenAI, but the value of the store is still an open question. Why should I use most GPTs (as the bots are called), when I can usually call up an app that does the same thing? But I can’t deny there’s one incredibly useful bot that’s changed a (small) part of my work life for the better. It’s called “What’s Another Word For,” and I made it myself.</p>
