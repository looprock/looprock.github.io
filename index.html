To kick things off, Apple holds a keynote event on the Monday to announce new software, which is what makes it of interest to the general public.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-06 02:37:17-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Nintendo Switch 2 includes a new built-in social feature called GameChat that allows up to 12 users to engage in video chats simultaneously, even if they're playing in different games. To facilitate this, Nintendo offers an official Switch 2 Camera that connects via USB-C, but it turns out that an iPhone does the job just as well, if not better.

Niles Mitchell has thoughtfully <a href="https://youtu.be/wGH_VF-Gx4Y">shared a demo</a> of the Switch-iPhone configuration that explains how to set it up. You'll need a HDMI to USB-C cable and a HDMI converter cable to connect them, which should cost around $30 in total.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-05 16:38:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            tvOS is probably the Apple operating system that gets the fewest updates each year, and that's not going to change in 2025. But thanks to the design overhaul that Apple is introducing across all of its software platforms, tvOS is set to get some interesting new features.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003300" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/tvOS-26-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
<h2>Naming</h2>
<br/>
As we've noted several times this week, Apple is changing the naming for its operating system updates. After tvOS 18, we're getting tvOS 26 instead of tvOS 19. The "26" represents the September 2025 to September 2026 release season for tvOS, with Apple planning to use the same numbering across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and visionOS too.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Updated Design</h2>
<br/>
The visionOS-style design update that's coming to iOS, iPadOS, and macOS will also extend to tvOS. tvOS tends to get little attention comparatively so we d [...]<br>
