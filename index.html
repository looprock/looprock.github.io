The database suggests that the iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will be available with and without a physical SIM card tray, depending on the country of sale. On the other hand, the base-model iPhone 17 might have only one battery size, as only a single capacity for that device has been discovered so far.

            In July 2024, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said he expected Samsung to begin shipping 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera sensors to Apple for iPhones <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/2026-iphone-48mp-camera-sensor-samsung/">as early as 2026</a>, which is when some iPhone 18 models are expected to be released.

<br/>
In a <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1964534143850860987">follow-up post</a> this weekend, however, Kuo said he now expects the first iPhone models with Samsung's sensor to be released in 2027. In other words, this rumor seemingly now applies to some iPhone 19 models, instead of iPhone 18 models.
<br/>
<br/>
It is also possible that Samsung's sensor could debut on the iPhone 18e in early 2027, but the iPhone 16e does not have an Ultra Wide rear camera currently.
