            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iOS 26 update, currently in beta, brings a nice optional upgrade to screen capture quality with HDR (High Dynamic Range) capture support. The new feature captures or video-records what's on your iPhone's screen while preserving rich colors and detail. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006623" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/iOS-26-Screenshots.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
HDR screenshots are particularly valuable when capturing content with high contrast – like bright app interfaces against dark backgrounds, HDR videos, or detailed photos. The enhanced dynamic range preserves details that would typically be lost in standard screenshots, making them ideal for sharing visual content or documenting app interfaces with greater fidelity.

Services chief <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eddy-cue/">Eddy Cue</a> is apparently the most vocal advocate of a deal to buy AI firms to bolster the company's offerings. Cue previously supported propositions of Apple acquiring Netflix and Tesla, both of which Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> turned down. Other executives such as software chief Craig Federighi have reportedly been reluctant to acquire AI startups, believing that Apple can build its own AI technology in-house.
