<br/>
The AI chatbot can now connect to Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, Box, and SharePoint, allowing users to query information directly from their stored documents and files. Use case examples include a financial analyst asking ChatGPT to pull data from company reports to generate investment insights, or a marketing professional analyzing product presentations without leaving the ChatGPT interface.

OpenAI says the cloud integrations respect existing organizational access controls, so ChatGPT can only access documents it is authorized to view. The company says that data  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WhatsApp is testing a new feature that lets users build their own AI chatbot assistant within the app, reports <em><a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-ios-25-17-10-75-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a></em>.

<br/>
Currently rolling out to a small number of WhatsApp beta testers is a new section in the app called "AI Studio," which walks users through the creation of their AI assistant. 
<br/>
<br/>
The idea isn't dissimilar to OpenAI's custom GPTs or Google Gemini's Gems. Users can devise their AI's role, personality traits, specialisms, and style of discourse, and start chatting with them immediately after creation. Here's how <em>WABetaInfo</em> describes it:

            Apple appears to be moving to the next-generation Qi 2.2 wireless charging standard, according to regulatory filings on Taiwan's NCC certification website. Qi2.2 is the forthcoming update to the Wireless Power Consortium's (WPC) Qi standard, building on improvements introduced with Qi 2.1.

Spotted by <em><a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/apple-magsafe-qi-2-2-wireless-charging-ncc-certification/">91mobiles.com</a></em>, the filings reveal two new MagSafe charger models – A3503 and A3502 – that support the upgraded Qi 2.2 standard. The chargers feature the familiar white puck design with braided cables in 2-meter and 1-meter lengths, respectively.

It's a notable upgrade mainly because of the faster charging speed. Qi 2.2 is technically capable of up to 50W charging output. In contrast, the Qi 2 standa [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is rumored to be working on a smart home hub that has been nicknamed the "HomePad." The device is expected to have a square iPad-like screen that can be attached to a HomePod-like speaker base, or it can be mounted on a wall.

            Apple's Live Photos, introduced in 2015, are photos that capture 1.5 seconds of video before and after you take a picture, with the aim of adding a little bit of life and movement to still images. 
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Since introducing Live Photos, Apple has added some effects to its Photos app that let you turn them into fun animated clips, which you can then share with family, friends, or the wider world. 
<br/>
<br/>
There are three effects in total that you can try on your own Live Photos. Loop repeats the action in a continuous looping video, Bounce rewinds the action backward and forward, and Long Exposure simulates a DSLR-like long exposure effect by blurring motion.

<br/>
The following steps show how you can apply them to your own Live Photos on iPhone and iPad.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            We&#8217;ve noted for years how U.S. regional telecom monopolies have effectively crushed competition in many U.S. markets and utterly defanged our regulators. This one-two punch of muted competition and no oversight routinely results in expensive, slow, spotty broadband access. Frustrated by this, communities all over the U.S. have responded to this market and regulatory failure [&#8230;]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple Music could get more visual flair in iOS 26 with full-screen animated artwork coming to the Lock Screen, according to <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/03/exclusive-ios-26-messages-carplay-more/">9to5Mac</a></em>.

<br/>
The rumored feature would expand on recent changes to the Lock Screen's Now Playing view. Currently, maximized album artwork from the Now Playing widget tints the entire interface, creating a more immersive experience when controlling music playback.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26 appears set to take that concept further by introducing animated artwork that fills the entire Lock Screen, making album covers and other visuals more dynamic and engaging.

The new iOS 26 features are expected to be unveiled at the WWDC keynote event on Monday, June 9. It starts at 10:00 a.m. and while Apple will  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's Notes app is rumored to be getting limited Markdown support in iOS 26 and macOS 26, according to <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/03/exclusive-ios-26-messages-carplay-more/">9to5Mac</a></em>. The feature would allow users to export text in the markdown format.

<br/>
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that some writers prefer to use over rich text. Rather than using HTML for bold, italics, links, and headers, Markdown uses quick character shortcuts like **bold** or #header. It sounds like the feature will only add support for exporting text with markdown formatting and not writing in markdown directly. 
<br/>
<br/>
If the rumor holds up, it's likely to be unveiled at next week's Worldwide Developers Conference alongside other iOS 26 improvements, including &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/ [...]<br>

            The 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference is coming up quick, with less than a week to go before the big keynote event. We're sharing a series of rumor recaps this week, for those who want to get a sneak peek at some of the features expected in Apple's upcoming software updates.

            Samsung recently launched the Galaxy S25 Edge, a super thin smartphone that will compete with Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>. To see what it's like using such a thin phone, <em>MacRumors</em> video editor Dan Barbera used it as his main device for two weeks to see what it might be like to use Apple's equivalent later this year.

<br/>
The Galaxy S25 Edge has a 6.7-inch display, so it's a larger smartphone, but because it's so thin and light, it's easy to hold. It's just 5.8mm thick and it weighs 163 grams, and it's so light that it almost feels like a plastic dummy phone. Apple's ‌iPhone 17 Air‌ could be even thinner at 5.5mm, and it will have a similar display size at 6.6 inches, so it should be a lot like the S25 Edge.

The latest word comes from Apple analyst Jeff Pu. In a research note with equity research firm GF Securities this week, Pu said that he expects the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and so-called iPhone 18 Fold to be equipped with Apple's A20 chip, and he believes the chip will have some key design changes over the A18 and upcoming A19 chips.

First, Pu reiterated that the A20 chip will be manufactured with TSMC's 2nm process. The current A18 Pro chip in iPhone 16 Pro models is fabricated with TSMC's second-generation 3nm process, while the A19 Pro chip for the iPhone 17 Pro models is expected to use TSMC's third-generation 3nm process.
