            China in the second quarter became the biggest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> market in the world, overtaking the United States for the first time in history, based on data analyzed by global market research company TechInsights (via <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=22752">The Elec</a></em>).

According to the research firm's Global Shipment Report, China accounted for 24% of all ‌iPhone‌ shipments in Q2 2023, while the U.S. market accounted for 21%.

As early as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/15/apple-tsmc-3nm-production-capacity/">May</a>, Apple was known to have booked nearly 90% of the Taiwanese pure-play foundry for its upcoming next-gen devices.

            Just a few weeks ahead of Apple unveiling new iPhones, rumors continue to circulate about new color options for the devices. The latest information comes from established leakers <a href="https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1696145808196780032">@MajinBuOfficial</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/URedditor/status/1696146103547146555">@URedditor</a>, who today said the lower-end iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models will be available in a new light green finish.

<br/>
@MajinBuOfficial said it appears the new color option will be very similar to the green finish available for the iPhone 12 and the discontinued iPhone 12 mini. However, the leaker is unsure if the color will be available when the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus launch in September, or introduced as an additional color option in spring 2024.
