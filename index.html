            <b>Published:</b> 2024-09-28 07:02:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple last week released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a>, and one version of the new earbuds has Active Noise Cancellation included. ANC means the ‌AirPods 4‌ have a feature set that rivals the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2, so we thought we'd compare the two for those undecided on which to get.

<br/>
The ‌AirPods 4‌ are Apple's first open-ear earbuds to include ANC, and the major difference between the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 and the ‌AirPods 4‌ is the silicone tips. The ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 have silicone tips for a tighter seal in the ear, while the ‌AirPods 4‌ don't.

You're not going to get the same level of ANC with the ‌AirPods 4‌ that you get with the ‌AirPods  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has finally brought T9 dialing support to the iPhone with iOS 18, a feature long available on Android devices. This addition to the Phone app allows users to quickly find and call contacts using the number pad, which can streamline the process of making calls if you've used the feature before.

<br/>
T9 dialing, or Text on 9 keys, is a predictive text technology that emerged in the late 90s to make it easier to type text messages on devices with limited input options, such as traditional mobile phones with numeric keypads. Each number key (2-9) on a T9 keypad is mapped to a set of letters. For example, the key "2" corresponds to "ABC," "3" to "DEF," and so on.

The best match appears first above the keypad, and tapping the person's name will call them. If there are several possible matches in your co [...]<br>

            Apple is developing a new version of its Vision Pro headset that is set to enter mass production in the second half of 2025, according to <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/ai-spatial-computing-to-be-the-main-selling-point-for-new-m5-powered-vision-pro-new-apple-15f409ea6c15">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.

<br/>
Kuo claims the most significant change in the new model will be the inclusion of Apple's M5 chip, a substantial upgrade from the M2 chip found in the current Vision Pro. The processor boost is expected to significantly improve device's computing power, with a particular emphasis on integrated Apple Intelligence features.

Apple's ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ models do not have the same simplified battery removal process as the ‌iPhone 16‌, with Apple instead using traditional stretch release adhesive for its pricier iPhones.

            Jerod is joined by Ryan Dahl to discuss his second take on leveling up JavaScript developers all around the world. Jerod asks Ryan why not try to fix or fork Node instead of starting fresh, how Deno (the open source project) can avoid the all too common rug pull (not cool) scenario, what's new in Deno 2 & their pragmatic decision to support npm, they talk JSR, they talk Deno KV & SQLite, they even talk about Ryan's open letter to Oracle in an attempt to free the unused "JavaScript" trademark from the giant's clutches.<br>
