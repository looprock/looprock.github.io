            <b>Published:</b> 2025-07-20 06:26:16-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's next-generation iPad Pro models will be equipped with two front-facing cameras, according <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-20/apple-s-2026-foldable-iphone-samsung-comparison-m5-ipad-pro-dual-front-cameras">to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

<br/>
In his <em>Power On</em> newsletter today, Gurman said the upcoming iPad Pro models with the M5 chip will have both portrait and landscape cameras, letting you capture photos and go on video calls without having to worry about the device's orientation.
<br/>
<br/>
The current iPad Pro models with the M4 chip have a single front camera that is designed to be used in landscape orientation.
<br/>
<br/>
Face ID already works in any orientation on the iPad Pro.
