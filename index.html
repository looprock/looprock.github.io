            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/retail/perthcity/">announced</a> that it will soon be opening a new retail store at Forrest Place, a pedestrianized area in the heart of Perth, Australia.

<br/>
The store will be in a historic building originally built for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, at the corner of Forrest Place and Murray Street. Apple is taking over a space that was previously occupied by Australian swimwear retailer City Beach.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple already has a store in central Perth on nearby Hay Street. That location, opened in 2010, will be permanently closing on Wednesday, June 25, and the newer and larger Forrest Place store will be holding its grand opening on Friday, June 27 at 9 a.m. local time.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is hiding a new ringtone within iOS 26.

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006157" height="592" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/ios-26-call-holding.jpg" width="1052"/>
<br/>
The new ringtone is an alternative version of the existing Reflection ringtone, which has been the default ringtone since the iPhone X was released in 2017. It was discovered within the code for the first developer beta of iOS 26, but it remains hidden, so you will not find it in the list of ringtones available in the Settings app for now.
<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear if Apple will move forward with releasing the ringtone in a later iOS 26 beta version.
<br/>
<br/>
The new ringtone was shared on X yesterday <a href="https://x.com/8810cfw/status/1935248131157049700">by the account @8810cfw</a>, in a post that was later reposted by the account <a href="https://x.com/VNchocoTaco">ShrimpApplePro</a>.

            In select U.S. states, residents can <a href="https://learn.wallet.apple/id">add their driver's license or state ID to the Wallet app</a> on the iPhone and Apple Watch, providing a convenient and contactless way to display proof of identity or age at select airports and businesses, and in select apps.

<br/>
Unfortunately, this feature continues to roll out very slowly since it was announced in 2021, with only nine U.S. states and Puerto Rico offering it so far.
<br/>
<br/>
During its WWDC 2025 keynote last week, Apple reiterated that more states plan to offer the feature in the future, but it did not provide a timeframe.

            In iOS 17 and later, Apple includes an accessibility setting that makes the haptic feedback feature activate faster than in previous versions of its mobile operating system. If you fondly hearken back for the days of 3D Touch, you might just prefer it.

As many iPhone users might remember, ‌3D Touch‌ was an interactive haptic feature that Apple introduced in 2015 with the ‌iPhone‌ 6s. When the iPhone XR was released in 2018, Apple kiboshed 3D Touch‌ to the dismay of some users, and instead implemented the simplified ‌Haptic Touch, which offers less functionality‌.
<br/>
<br/>
‌3D Touch‌ supported multiple levels of pressure for different interactions depending on how hard you pressed, with Apple implementing "Peek and Pop" gestures. In contrast, ‌Haptic Touch‌ supports just a single level of pressure for the long pre [...]<br>
