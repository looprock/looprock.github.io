            <b>Published:</b> 2024-01-31 16:20:04-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has extended its modem chip licensing agreement with Qualcomm through March 2027, Qualcomm said today during its first earnings call of 2024. Apple's existing agreement has now been extended for two years, so we can expect to see Qualcomm modems in the next several <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> generations.

<br/>
Apple has been working on developing its own 5G modem chip in-house for the last several years. The technology would keep it from having to rely on Qualcomm for 5G chips, but Apple's progress has seen several delays.
<br/>
<br/>
In November 2023, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-in-house-5g-modem-delays/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> said that Apple's work on a modem chip had been postponed until late 2025 or 2026, and it is possible it could see furthe [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-01-31 12:38:39-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The cable that connects the Vision Pro battery pack to the headset for power purposes appears to be fixed in place, but it can in fact be removed if necessary.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929544" height="1060" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/vision-pro-battery-pack.jpg" width="1640"/>
<br/>
Journalist Ray Wong was able to use a SIM card pin to "unlock" the cable, and after he did that, it was able to be removed from the battery pack. There is a small hole located next to the cable, which is apparently a locking mechanism.
<br/>
<br/>
The cable that attaches the battery pack to the headset looks similar to a Lightning cable, but it has too many pins to be Lightning. Instead, it is a proprietary cable that won't be able to be connected to other accessories or used for another purpose.

            The Apple Vision Pro headset comes with an external battery pack with a capacity of 3,166 mAh, compared to the 3,274 mAh battery found in the iPhone 15 Pro, although the voltages are different so the measurement alone can't be considered equivalent.

<br/>
According to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/the_vision_pro"><em>Daring Fireball</em>'s John Gruber</a>, the Vision Pro battery is about the width and height of an iPhone 15 Pro, but thicker. Weight-wise, it is also heavier: About 325g, compared to 187g for an iPhone 15 Pro. "It's closer in thickness and weight to two iPhone 15's than it is to one," according to Gruber.

It is not unusual that iOS 17.2.1 is no longer being signed.

Apple does not provide details on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware, so it is unclear what's new. The <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/106340">limited release notes</a> for the update list only "bug fixes and other improvements."
