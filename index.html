<br/>
Apple says fans will be able to "follow every matchup with added details on each series and more," but we have not noticed any immediate changes in the app after updating to the new version. The first NBA and NHL playoff series begin on Saturday, April 20, so the extra details will presumably become visible then. Some info like playoff matchups and conference standings was already available in the previous version of the app.
<br/>

Released in February, the Apple Sports app shows scores, schedules, stats, and more for a variety of leagues, such as the NBA, NHL, MLB, MLS, and Premier League.  [...]<br>

Instead of sticking wiht that, I decided to flesh him out a bit, making him a 5th level Artificer. This gave him a steel defender companion and access to interesting spells. I’ve never really played an artificer or looked at that class next, so it was fun to imagine that out. And, then, when it came to the encounter on the ferry in Easthaven, I had a lot more options than what a Mind Master would give.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Introduction Rust&rsquo;s memory safety features are advantageous to Rust developers because they:
Ensure robust protection against buffer overflows and underflows, enhancing the reliability and security of software.
Empower developers to manage type coercion effectively, promoting code reliability and safety while facilitating safe type conversions.
Provide confidence in writing concurrent code by enforcing strict mutability rules and synchronization, thereby preventing data race issues and ensuring code correctness and efficiency.
With these memory safety features deeply integrated into Rust&rsquo;s design, developers can build more reliable, secure, and efficient software, spanning various aspects of memory management, type handling, and concurrent programming paradigms.<br>

<br/>
Pixelmator recently added support to the app for vector PDFs, which allows users to import image, shape, and text elements in the portable document format as separate layers.

<br/>
With the newest version, this support has been expanded so that users can edit imported text as regular text layers. In practice, this means existing text in PDFs can be more easily replaced, formatted, and styled using Pixelmator Pro tools. As the developers explain:

In iOS 17.4, released last month, Apple no longer limits EU users to the handful of browser options that iOS currently offers as alternatives in other parts of the world. Instead, users in the EU who open Safari for the first time are presented with a choice screen that allows them to opt for a new default browser from a list of popular alternatives in their country.

The change has led to a sharp increase in third-party browser usage, based on several reports. On Wednesday, [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>An enterprise AI strategy probably means adding AI to your existing apps and workflows, not just standing up a stand-alone AI app. We experience generative AI as chatbots in the consumer space - and they&rsquo;re great! - but this doesn&rsquo;t seem like the best approach for business applications. Think about search. We don&rsquo;t even notice it now, but at work, search is built into existing apps, it&rsquo;s not usually a stand-alone app that tightly integrates with and links into existing apps. I think Enterprise AI will be the same. We&rsquo;ll see!</p><br>
