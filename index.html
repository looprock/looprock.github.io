            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            It is well known that if we attempt to apply Maxwell’s electrodynamics, as conceived at the present time, to moving bodies, we are led to asymmetry which does not agree with observed phenomena. Let us think of the mutual action between a magnet and a conductor. The observed phenomena in this case depend only on the relative motion of the conductor and the magnet, while according to the usual conception, a distinction must be made between the cases where the one or the other of the bodies is in motion. If, for example, the magnet moves and the conductor is at rest, then an electric field of certain energy-value is produced in the neighbourhood of the magnet, which excites a current in those parts of the field where a conductor exists. But if the magnet be at rest and the conductor be set in motion, no electric field is produced in the neighbourhood of the magnet, but an electromotive force which corresponds to no energy in itself is produced in the conductor; this causes an electric current of the same magnitu [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Consensus algorithms are essential in decentralized networks, ensuring that computers agree on shared data and valid transactions without a central authority. In simple terms, it's like friends agreeing on changes to a shared document. Proof of Stake (PoS) is one such algorithm used in Ethereum, where validators stake cryptocurrency to propose and validate blocks. Attacks like Nothing-at-Stake, Long-Range, Nothing-to-Stake, and 51% can compromise network security. Ethereum's PoS includes measures like slashing penalties and checkpointing to protect against these threats. Consensus algorithms keep decentralized systems secure and trustworthy, paving the way for a decentralized and secure digital future.<br>

<p id="1Ghpml">D., a carpenter and Etsy seller of several years, recently sold a piece of custom, made-to-order furniture for around $150. The sale itself was business as usual for their shop — but it came with a sense of exasperation. Their earnings would be tied up for weeks while bills, rent, and expenses pile up.</p>
<p id="ZV7PsK">Since late June, Etsy has had D.’s account under restrictive settings, putting a hold on the bulk of money that’s coming in as customers place orders. In D.’s case, 75 percent of earnings from a $150 order, as an example, are being held by Etsy — in what’s known as a “payment reserve” — for anywhere between two weeks and 45 days.
