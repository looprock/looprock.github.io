            <b>Published:</b> 2024-11-08 07:06:26-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has returned to using two 128GB storage chips in the new Mac mini with 256GB of storage, according to a <a href="https://x.com/ohgkg/status/1854859167213011199">partial teardown video</a> shared on social media today. This means the base-model Mac mini with the M4 chip will not have significantly slower SSD speeds compared to higher-end configurations of the computer with 512GB, 1TB, or 2TB of storage, as multiple NAND chips allows for faster SSD read and write speeds.

<br/>
The teardown video also reveals that storage is modular in the new Mac mini, meaning that it can be easily removed since it is not soldered down.

Apple has gradually expanded new camera technologies, such as sensor-shift stabilization, 48-megapixel sensors, and the tetraprism 5x telephoto camera, across its ‌iPhone‌ models in recent years. It now appears that after completing the rear camera array's transition to 48-megapixel sensors by bringing one to the telephoto camera on next year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> Pro models, the next significant camera upgrade will be the introduction of a variable aperture.

Priced at $999, the Arc Ultra brings an upgrade in sound quality compared to the original Arc. It can be paired with the Sub 4, which is also new, for added bass. The Sub 4 isn't required, and the Arc Ultra sounds great even without it. For audiophiles, the Arc Ultra has 9.1.4 spatial audio with Dolby Atmos, and it is able to produce sound that feels like it's coming from all around you.
