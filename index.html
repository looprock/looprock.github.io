            <p>We’re solidly in the “you’re doing it wrong” era of AI hustling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The companies that are thriving in the AI era are doing much more than building models. They’re building systems. They’re aggregating data, governance and workflows into AI-ready infrastructure that delivers at scale. If you’re stuck in pilot purgatory, this is your roadmap out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The McKinsey survey shows one clear signal of progress – workflow redesign. The companies with more success in using effectively using AI, about half say they’re using technology not just to do things faster, but to essentially rewrite how their business works. Most are actively rebuilding how work moves between people and systems. It’s a shift from fine-tuning the old way to creating something new entirely–and that’s what separates real transformation from just minor upgrades.</p>

Google’s $10 billion investment in Belgium and $5.5 billion in Germany for cloud infrastructure signals a strong commitment to the region. Sovereign solutions, powered by GPUs from NVIDIA and Google TPUs, enable organizations to build locally compliant, high-performance applications. The ultimate goal?

<br/>
The company's board of directors and senior executives "recently intensified preparations for Cook to hand over the reins," the report said.
<br/>
<br/>
While the report said that Apple is unlikely to name a new CEO before its next earnings report in late January, it went on to explain that an announcement early in the year would allow for a smooth leadership transition, ahead of Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in June and iPhone event in September.
<br/>
<br/>
No final decisions have been made, and the timing could change, the report said.
