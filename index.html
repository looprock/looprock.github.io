            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup noticeably lacks a model with a display size below six inches, just two years after Apple extolled the virtues of a 5.4-inch device. So why did Apple eliminate the "mini" device that some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> customers had come to love?

<br/>
Apple debuted the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12 mini</a> in 2020 following years of calls from ‌iPhone‌ fans for the company to offer a small-screen device with the latest features.

In a new <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apple-iphone-15-pro-gaming-interview">interview</a>, Jeremy Sandmel, Apple's Senior Director of GPU Software, and Tim Millet, Apple's VP of Platform Architecture, discussed the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌'s more advanced gaming capabilities. During the announcement of the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ models, Apple highlighted how the A17 Pro chip features a brand new GPU with hardware-accelerated ray tracing, enabling console games like "Resident Evil 4" and "Assassin's Creed: Mirage" to be played on the &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iph [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            During Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/everything-apple-announced-fall-2023-event/">"Wonderlust" event</a> earlier this week, Apple claimed that the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ camera system "pushes the limits of what you can capture with a smartphone." It was a reference to the device's support for "spatial computing video," but the mention was brief and lacking detail.

<br/>
For those who missed it, spatial video is Apple's name for what is essentially 3D video. The iPhone 15 Pro is able to record spatial videos natively by combining video captured by the sensors of the Main and Ultra Wide cameras, which results in something akin to stereoscopic video.
<br/>
<br/>
This 3D video can then be played back using Apple's "spatial computing" Vision Pro headset when it's released early next year, allowing users to r [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Contactless payments use near-field communication (NFC) or radio frequency identification (RFID) to complete transactions. Tapping a card or phone on a terminal is much safer than swiping or using a chip reader. Industry-wide cooperation among card reader companies, credit card networks and issuers can make the practice safer.<br>

            I wrote Little Brother in a white-hot fury between May 7, 2007 and July 2, 2007: exactly eight weeks from the day I thought it up to the day I finished it (Alice, to whom this book is dedicated, had to put up with me clacking out the final chapter at 5AM in our hotel in Rome, where we were celebrating our anniversary). I'd always dreamed of having a book just materialize, fully formed, and come pouring out of my fingertips, no sweat and fuss -- but it wasn't nearly as much fun as I'd thought it would be. There were days when I wrote 10,000 words, hunching over my keyboard in airports, on subways, in taxis -- anywhere I could type. The book was trying to get out of my head, no matter what, and I missed so much sleep and so many meals that friends started to ask if I was unwell.
