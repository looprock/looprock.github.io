            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Setting custom ringtones on your iPhone is dramatically easier in iOS 26. Apple has eliminated the need for the cumbersome process of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2ceDaBdwZg">exporting a track from the GarageBand app</a>, and now provides a simple four-step process that works directly from the Files app.

<br/>
The new streamlined approach means you can transform any MP3 or M4A audio file that's less than 30 seconds into a personalized ringtone in a just a few taps. Whether it's a favorite song snippet, a voice memo, or a sound effect you've downloaded, the process is now as straightforward as sharing a photo. Here's how to set up your custom ringtone without opening an additional app in iOS 26 (currently in beta).

            In iOS 26, Apple is introducing several new features for its Messages app, and this one in particular is likely to make interacting with message bubbles way less frustrating. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010448" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/ios-26-messages-select-copy-paste.jpg" width="2000"/>

When you tap and hold on any message bubble, a new "Select" option now appears alongside the familiar copy and reaction choices, finally solving one of Messages' most persistent frustrations.

The Select feature allows you to highlight specific portions of text within a message rather than copying the entire message. Simply tap and hold any message bubble, choose "Select" from the contextual menu, and then use the drag handles to highlight exactly the text you need. It works across all message types, including text messages and iMessages.

The new selective text feature should come in handy in a range of scen [...]<br>

A selection of public beta testers and developers who have opted into either the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15 developer beta or the ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15 public beta are instead receiving the macOS Tahoe public beta. The beta that Apple is distributing has a build number of 25A5316i, which is newer than the 25A5306g build number of the third macOS Tahoe developer beta.

macOS Tahoe is showing up for Apple silicon Mac users who do not have Rosetta 2 installed. Most Apple silicon Macs <em>do</em> have Rosetta installed, and those Macs won't detect the mistaken beta release.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple recently announced that iPhone users will soon be able to watch videos right on the CarPlay screen in supported vehicles.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This is arguably the biggest new CarPlay feature coming with the iOS 26 update later this year, and yet Apple did not even mention it during its WWDC 2025 keynote last month. Instead, it was buried <a href="https://developer.apple.com/carplay/">on Apple's developer website</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
iPhone users will be able to wirelessly stream videos to the CarPlay screen using AirPlay, according to Apple. For safety reasons, video playback will only be available when the vehicle is parked, to prevent distracted driving. The connected iPhone will be able to detect when the vehicle is in motion and end playback.

Apple says that automakers need to add support for CarPlay with AirPla [...]<br>

<br/>
<br/>
That said, there's nothing in Gurman's report to suggest that regular iPhone users need be concerned about a lack of UI innovations coming to their devices next year.

<br/>
Apple could potentially end up having to drop a key supplier of iPhone OLED panels, following a preliminary ruling issued by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that found Chinese display maker BOE violated federal trade secret laws.

<br/>
The ITC found that BOE and seven of its subsidiaries misappropriated Samsung Display's trade secrets to manufacture panels, violating Section 337 of the Tariff Act. The commission has proposed banning BOE's OLED imports and ordering existing U.S. inventories be removed from sale.
