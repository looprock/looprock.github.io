            Apple is surveying its employees about smart glasses as it continues to consider releasing its own version of Meta's Ray-Ban glasses, reports <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/01/meta-ray-bans-ai-training/">Bloomberg</a></em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>. Apple has launched an internal study of products that are on the market, and is currently gathering feedback from Apple employees.

In an email sent out to employees, Apple's Product Systems Quality team called for participants for "an upcoming user study with current market smart glasses." According to Gurman, it is common for Apple to use focus groups when it is deciding on whether to enter a new market. Using employees for the focus groups allows Apple to keep its plans secret, something that wouldn't be po [...]<br>

It is not unusual for Apple to stop signing older versions of iOS shortly after a new version of iOS is released. When Apple stops signing an update, it can no longer be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side software verification check that happens before new software is installed, so those who have upgraded to the latest version of ‌iOS 18‌ cannot downgrade to iOS 18.0.1.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In a <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/dma/NCS-October-2024.pdf">recent document</a> outlining the steps it has taken to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act, Apple revealed that it will allow iPhone and iPad users in the EU to set default navigation and translation apps starting in "spring 2025." That timeframe suggests these options will be added in iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4, which <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-intelligence-eu-april-2025/">should be released in April</a>.

Apple had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/22/apple-eu-default-app-update/">already announced</a> that iPhone and iPad users in the EU would be able to set default navigation and translation apps in "future software updates," but it did not share a more specific timeframe for these options until now.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iPadOS is now under formal scrutiny by the European Commission to determine whether it complies with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA).
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-949489" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/Apple-Pencil-Pro-Newsroom.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
The announcement by the European Commission marks the next step in its regulatory oversight of Apple, following the iPadOS designation as a "gatekeeper" platform in April 2024. The classification was part of a broader effort to apply the newly enforced DMA, aimed at limiting the dominance of major tech firms and promoting fair competition across the European Union.
<br/>
<br/>
The regulations outline obligations for "gatekeepers," mandating these companies to open up their software ecosystems to ensure a level playing field.

            Introduction: Welcome to Episode 3 of JSON for Engineers! In this episode, Miki Tebeka explores the intricacies of JSON field mapping and value handling, especially when working in strongly typed languages like Go. This session covers the practical challenges of matching JSON fields to Go struct fields, distinguishing between missing and zero values, and using default values to ensure robust JSON parsing.
