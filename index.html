            Proton today launched <a href="https://proton.me/blog/authenticator-app">Proton Authenticator</a>, a free two-factor authentication app available across all major platforms including iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux.

<br/>
The open-source app generates time-based one-time passwords as an additional security layer beyond regular login credentials. Unlike competitors such as Google Authenticator and Microsoft Authenticator, Proton Authenticator also offers end-to-end encrypted backup and cross-device sync without ads or tracking, just like Proton's other products.

The Swiss-based company claims users can import existing 2FA tokens from other apps within seconds, while the app works offline and automatically backs up authentication codes.

The shutdown is going to follow a phased approach, according to the company. The password manager will become view-only from August 28, meaning new entries and autofill features will be disabled.

Apple says that CVE-2025-6558 was a vulnerability in open source code that also affected Apple software. The flaw could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code using HTML pages created for that purpose, escaping Chrome's sandboxing. Google patched the issue on July 15, and said that it had been actively exploited.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple added Thunderbolt 5 connectivity to its latest M4 Pro and M4 Max machines, and companies are starting to launch Thunderbolt 5 docks compatible with Apple's Thunderbolt 5 Macs. Earlier this year, Anker came out with the Anker Prime TB5 Docking Station, a 14-port dock with a unique design and a high-end feature set.

<br/>
Docks are useful because they expand the available number of ports that you can use at one time, and add legacy ports like USB-A that Apple has discontinued. Thunderbolt 5 provides 80Gb/s symmetric data, which is double that of Thunderbolt 4, plus there is a bandwidth boost option up to 120Gb/s when displays are connected. You're able to connect more without running into bandwidth limits.

            Skechers recently started selling a <a href="https://www.skechers.com/kids/collections-features/find-my-skechers/">line of kids shoes</a> that have a hidden compartment under the insole for inserting Apple's AirTag item tracker.

The idea here is that parents can put an AirTag in the shoes, and then track the location of those shoes (and the child wearing them) in the Find My app, which is available across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and on the web at iCloud.com.

The leader of Apple's foundation models group, Ruoming Pang, was one of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/07/apple-ai-executive-leaves-for-meta/">first Apple AI researchers to join Meta</a>. Since then, several employees who worked under him have also left for Meta. Meta is aggressively hiring for its Superintelligence Labs, an AI division that's building advanced AI systems capable of performing at or beyond human-level intelligence.

<br/>
According to Apple, the DoJ's lawsuit has the potential to "set a dangerous precedent" that would allow the government to dictate the design and function of technology, plus it threatens "the very principles that set the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> apart" from competing devices.
