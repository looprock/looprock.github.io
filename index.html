            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-03 04:33:57-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WhatsApp has ended support for iOS versions older than iOS 15.1, removing the chat platform's compatibility with several iPhone models in the process. The change began on June 1, after Meta delayed it from an original planned date of May 5.
<br/>

<br/>
WhatsApp is no longer compatible with iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus models. Users with those devices won't be able to access the encrypted chat service through the app unless they upgrade their iPhone. Alternatively, users can visit web.whatsapp.com in their browser, but the experience won't be the same.
<br/>
<br/>
Users who intend to upgrade can back up their WhatsApp chats to iCloud, and restore their full chat and media history to a newer, supported device using using WhatsApp's Chat Transfer feature. Instructions on how to do so are outlined in WhatsApp's &lt;a href="https://f [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-03 04:16:26-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            YouTube has updated its iOS app to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/youtube/id544007664?platform=iphone">version 20.22.1</a>, which now requires iOS 16 or later to install and run. The change means several older iPhone models are no longer officially compatible with the app.

<br/>
The affected devices are those that cannot upgrade beyond iOS 15 – namely, the iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and the first-generation iPhone SE. If you have an iPod touch 7, that will no longer run the app either.
<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, the YouTube app for iPad now requires iPadOS 16 or later, which means the app has discontinued support for the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 4.

Users with these older devices can still access YouTube through their web browser by visiting m.youtube.com, but the experience wo [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            A Chinese leaker with a mixed track record for accurate predictions has today disputed claims that the regular iPhone 17 and all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air will feature ProMotion displays.

<br/>
ProMotion has been limited to the Pro models since it debuted on the iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max in 2021, but several sources have suggested that Apple will this year fit the 120Hz variable refresh technology into the base iPhone 17 model, as well as the new iPhone 17 Air that replaces the Plus model in the lineup.
<br/>
<br/>
However, Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/5821279480/PuPiSAB0t">Fixed Focus Digital</a>'s sources apparently tell them that the panel being used in the upcoming non-Pro models is "just a standard 120Hz screen, not ProMotion with adaptive refresh rate."

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-02 12:33:59-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            It has been three weeks as of today since Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/apple-releases-ios-18-5/">released iOS 18.5</a>, and we are still waiting for the first iOS 18.6 beta to follow.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-997222" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iOS-18.6-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Below, we outline everything we know about iOS 18.6 so far.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Timing</h2>
<br/>
Apple's software engineers have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/31/apple-begins-testing-ios-18-6/">internally testing iOS 18.6 since late March</a>, according to the <em>MacRumors</em> visitors logs.
<br/>
<br/>
The first betas of iOS 13.6 through iOS 16.6 were all released before WWDC over the years, while the first iOS 17.6 beta was released the week after WWDC last year, so it is hard to pinpoint exactly when the first iOS 18.6 beta will be available.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            There are several ways you can take screenshots on a Mac. Preview offers the option from its File menu. There's also a little screen capture app in the macOS Utilities folder called Screenshot. But the simplest and most common method is to use your Mac's built-in shortcut key combinations. 
<br/>

<br/>
Taking a screenshot is as easy as hitting <strong>Shift-Command-3</strong> to capture the whole screen, or <strong>Shift-Command-4</strong> to capture a portion of the screen using the mouse cursor as a crosshair selection tool (a tap of the spacebar also turns it into a camera for capturing windows). 
<br/>
<br/>
Screenshots taken using key shortcuts are typically saved on your desktop. However, if you tack the <strong>Control</strong> key onto either of these shortcuts, macOS will copy the captured image to the clipboard instead of sa [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-02 07:11:42-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If you have ever used an Apple TV, you are likely familiar with the device's linear keyboard, which can be tedious to use if you have a lot of text to enter.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003836" height="1082" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/Apple-TV-Linear-Keyboard-Layout.png" width="1920"/>
<br/>
Fortunately, if you are tired of swiping back and forth while entering a long password, the keyboard's layout can easily be changed. To do so, open the Settings app on the Apple TV, select General → Keyboard Layout, and choose Grid instead of Linear.
<br/>
<br/>
The on-screen keyboard will then have a square layout by default.

For anyone unfamiliar with the Shortcuts app, the tool lets users create custom workflows or actions – called shortcuts – to perform tasks automatically or with minimal interaction.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Apple TV is much more private than competing streaming hardware, offering users a rare refuge from the pervasive tracking that defines most smart TV experiences, according to a comprehensive analysis by <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/all-the-ways-apple-tv-boxes-do-and-mostly-dont-track-you/">Ars Technica</a></em>.

<br/>
The main difference is said to be Apple's approach to automatic content recognition (ACR), the invasive tracking technology that monitors viewing habits on nearly every smart TV and streaming device. Apple TV devices don't include ACR software, and that gives them an immediate privacy advantage over alternatives like Roku, Amazon Fire TV, and built-in, smart TV platforms.
