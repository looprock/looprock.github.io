<br/>
Thanks to an update first spotted by <em><a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/spatiality-1080p-60fps-4k-30fps-capture/">UploadVR</a></em>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/spatialify/id6471922894">Spatialify</a> can now record spatial videos with HDR in 1080p at 60fps or in 4K at 30fps. In comparison, Apple's native Camera app is limited to recording spatial video in 1080p at 30fps.
<br/>
<br/>
Shortly after Apple's Vision Pro headset launched in February in the United States, Apple released iOS 17.2, which brought the new spatial video recording format to iPhone 15 Pro models.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-03-29 03:42:17-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            OLED panel supply issues may be partly behind Apple's iPad Pro launch delay, based on reports coming out of Korea.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-853666" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/iPad-Pro-OLED-Feature-2.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Apple's original plan was to rely on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/apple-has-two-suppliers-for-oled-ipad-pro/">different OLED display suppliers</a> for the upcoming iPad Pro models, with Samsung Display exclusively producing ~11-inch panels and LG Display responsible for the required ~13-inch panels. 
<br/>
<br/>
The division of labor was reportedly due to changes in Apple's demand outlook for OLED iPad Pro models, as well as the unstable production capacity and yield of the two suppliers, which are both still getting to grips with Apple's requirement for new panel technologies. 
<br/>
<br/>
Early reports suggested the new models could arrive as soon as this month. However, according t [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-03-28 16:38:48-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Oregon this week signed a Right to Repair bill into law, and it is notable because it is the first such law that puts a stop to the practice of parts pairing. Manufacturers like Apple are not able to require customers to use Apple-sourced parts that then have to be authenticated, with the bill giving Apple device owners the right to use new parts, used parts, or third-party parts.

<br/>
Apple has launched repair tools for both independent repair shops and consumers, but repair components must be purchased directly from Apple. Components must be paired with a device serial number after being installed, which prevents unauthorized repairs that use third-party components. The bill states that companies cannot reduce the performance of a device or display misleading warnings for parts that are not properly paired [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Amazon today <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-one-app">launched the Amazon One app</a>, which is designed to allow customers to scan their palms to make device-free purchases at Whole Foods, Panera Bread, and 150 third-party locations in stadiums, airports, fitness centers, and convenience stores.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>

Prior to the launch of the app, signing up for Amazon One had to be done in a physical location with an Amazon One device. The app lets customers create a profile, take a photo of their palm, and add a payment method. Finishing sign-up will still require an initial interaction with an Amazon One machine.

<br/>
Amazon One can be used for payment, entry to venues, age verification, and loyalty rewards. The service uses generative AI to match a camera phone photo of a person's palm to near-infrared imagery from an Amazon One scanner.

            Apple this month sued its former employee Andrew Aude in California state court, alleging that he breached the company's confidentiality agreement and violated labor laws by leaking sensitive information to the media and employees at other tech companies.

Aude joined Apple as an iOS software engineer in 2016, shortly after graduating college. He worked on optimizing battery performance, making him "privy to information regarding dozens of Apple's most sensitive projects," according to the complaint.

The theory comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/maxtechofficial">Max Tech</a>'s <a href="https://twitter.com/VadimYuryev">Vadim Yuryev</a>, who outlined his thinking in a <a href="https://twitter.com/VadimYuryev/status/1773135334567788661">post on X</a> earlier today. Citing a <a href="https://x.com/techanalye1/status/1740142759942750246?s=20">post from @techanalye1</a> which suggests the M3 Max chip no longer features the UltraFusion interconnect, Yuryev postulated that the as-yet-unreleased "M3 Ultra" chip will not be able to comprise two Max chips in a single package. This means that the M3 Ultra is likely to be a standalone chip for the first time.
