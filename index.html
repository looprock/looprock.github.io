            <b>Published:</b> 2023-09-06 03:45:55-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The iPhone 15's expected move to USB-C this year may motivate a large number of Android users to switch phones, according to a survey conducted by <a href="https://www.sellcell.com/blog/iphone-15-usb-c-charging-survey/">SellCell</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-896102" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Apple-Prefer-USB-C-Lightning-Feature-Remake.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
SellCell asked over 1,000 iPhone users and over 1,000 Android users in the United States to gather its data. Of existing iPhone users surveyed, 63% said that Apple moving to a USB-C charging port would influence their decision to upgrade to an iPhone 15. 
<br/>
<br/>
Of those that would be motivated to buy because of USB-C, the majority of iPhone users (37%) said they would upgrade because they would be able to use a single charging cable for iPhones, Macs, and iPads. Overall, 66% of iPhone users said that they will upgrade to an iPhone 15.

<p>Each year, Etsy hosts an event known as  “CodeMosaic” - an internal hackathon in which Etsy admin propose and build bold advances quickly in our technology across a number of different themes.  People across Etsy source ideas, organize into teams, and then have 2-3 days to build innovative proofs-of-concept that might deliver big wins for Etsy’s buyers and sellers, or improve internal engineering systems and workflows.</p>
<p>Besides being a ton of fun, CodeMosaic is a time for engineers to pilot novel ideas. Our team’s project this year was extremely ambitious - we wanted to build a system for stateful machine learning (ML) model training and online machine learning. While our ML pipelines are no stranger to streaming data, we currently don’t have any models that learn in an online context - that is, that can have their weights updated in near-real time.</p>

businesses should start using Postgres.  It covers Postgres's structural benefits like vendor independence, code quality, and technology like NoSQL.  It also covers the challenges that
could be faced, like cost, time, and in-house expertise.  When I saw "Not controlled by a single vendor" in both the benefits and challenges sections, I knew he was on the right track!

The discussion comes ahead of the publication of the first list of services to be regulated by the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The legislation introduces new rules that apply to tech giants that meet its "gatekeeper" criteria and force them to open up their various services and platforms to other companies and developers. For example, Apple could be forced to allow third-party companies and rival apps like Meta's WhatsApp to integrate directly with iMessage.

In recent correspondence with the European Commission, Apple argued that iMessage does not meet the number of users at which the DMA's rul [...]<br>
