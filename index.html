            Ahead of the Vision Pro launch that's coming on February 2, Apple has officially debuted the Vision Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. With the ‌App Store‌ live for the device, apps on the iOS ‌App Store‌ will soon list Vision Pro compatibility.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-01-16 09:33:52-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today received FCC approval for the upcoming Vision Pro headset, just days ahead of when pre-orders are set to go live for the device. FCC approval comes a little over two weeks before when the Vision Pro will be in the hands of consumers.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913199" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Vision-Pro-Person.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
It is not unusual for new Apple devices to lack FCC approval until close to their launch date as it can take quite a bit of time for Apple to get products cleared. Apple devices undergo rigorous FCC testing in the United States prior to being able to be sold to the public.
<br/>
<br/>
For the last several months, Apple has been required to provide a warning message letting consumers know that the Vision Pro did not yet have FCC approval, but the wording will now be able to be removed from the website, advertising, and other places where it is printed.

            Apple overtook Samsung as the top global smartphone manufacturer in 2023, according to preliminary data from <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS51776424">market research firm IDC</a>. If the data is accurate, it is the first time Samsung has lost the top spot to another company in 13 years. In 2013, Nokia held the number one spot, Samsung was second, and Apple didn't even feature in the top five.

IDC bases its analyses on market share of global smartphone shipments across the year. According to the report, Apple took a 20.1% market share, while Samsung took 19.4% of the share.
