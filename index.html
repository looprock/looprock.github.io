Roborock is one of the companies that's adopting Matter, and the Roborock Saros 10R now works with ‌HomeKit‌. The Saros 10R is one of Roborock's flagship vacuums and it's relatively new, so like most of these Matter-enabled vacuum options, it does not come cheap. It's $1,600, but it does have Roborock's most advanced feature set.

<br/>
It is more flexible than Nanoleaf's traditional light strips, and it has a silicone cover that diffuses the light so it does not need to be under or behind a TV, display, or other device. It can be crafted into a specific shape, manipulated into an abstract design, or used to outline furniture and decor.

Each $70 rope light is five meters long (16 feet), and it can display multiple colors at one time. Nanoleaf ships it with mounting clips so that it can be securely mounted to a wall in a myriad of designs.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple's annual developer and software-oriented event, is less than three weeks away. We haven't heard a great deal about macOS 16 ahead of its announcement this year, so we could be in for some major surprises when June 9 rolls around. Here's what we know so far about the next major update to Apple's Mac operating system.

<h2>macOS 16 Name?</h2>
<br/>
Every year heading into WWDC, one question on many Mac fans' minds is what Apple will choose as the name for the next version of macOS. The tradition dates all the way back to the beginning of Mac OS X with its big cat names, and then in 2013 Apple shifted to Calfornia-themed names with the unveiling of OS X Mavericks.

Back in the early days after the debut of OS X Mavericks, we discovered a &lt;a href=" [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple last week added iPad Air models with the M2 chip to its <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished/ipad/ipad-air">refurbished store in the UK</a>, for the first time since the device was released in May 2024.

<br/>
As usual, the refurbished models are discounted by approximately 15% to 20% compared to Apple's original pricing for the equivalent brand-new models. For example, the 13-inch iPad Air with the M2 chip, 128GB of storage, and Wi-Fi only is <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/FV273ZN/A/Refurbished-13-inch-iPad-Air-M2-Wi-Fi-128GB-Space-Gray">currently available for £639</a>, compared to £799 when it was first released last year.
<br/>
<br/>
For now, availability is limited to the UK, but inventory should expand to the U.S. and other countries over the next several weeks.
