            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Firefox for iOS 26 will get a new "<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/firefox/shake-to-summarize/">Shake to Summarize</a>" feature that generates an AI summary of a webpage when iPhone users shake their device. The feature uses the on-device language models that power Apple Intelligence, but it isn't limited to iPhone 15 Pro and newer.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
On older devices that don't support Apple Intelligence, the feature defaults to Mozilla's cloud-based AI, which creates a summary and then sends it back to iPhone. Here's how it works:

<li>Tap the thunderbolt icon in the address bar.</li>

Yesterday, supply chain analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/07/airpods-pro-3-this-year-per-kuo/">reported</a> that Apple is planning to debut the ‌AirPods Pro 3‌ this year.

Crucially, Kuo added that Apple is planning to introduce a successor to this year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> in 2026.

Her topics:
- The steps someone could take to get themselves up to speed on their employer's legacy software.
