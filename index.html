Samsung is encouraging users to shop through the Shop Samsung mobile app this season, which has some exclusive deals on smartphones, smartwatches, and mobile accessories. Prices on TVs and monitors should be the same on the web as they are on the mobile app, however.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>When a single query is run outside of a transaction block, it is clear how transaction visibility should behave — only transactions committed before the query started should be visible.  Changes made by
other sessions during the query, even if committed during the query, should not be visible.  Slide 11 of my <a class="txt2html" href="https://momjian.us/main/presentations/internals.html#mvcc" style="text-decoration: none;"><em>MVCC Unmasked</em></a> presentation
illustrates this.
</p>
<p>For queries run in transaction blocks, the ideal behavior is less clear, so Postgres supports three options for controlling transaction block behavior.  The default,
<a class="txt2html" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/transaction-iso.html#XACT-READ-COMMITTED" style="text-decoration: none;">READ COMMITTED</a>, causes each new query in a transaction block to get a new visibility snapshot, meaning that
each new query sees changes that were committed by other sessions before the query started.
