            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            2023 is set to become the first calendar year with no new iPads released in the device's history, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/05/all-ipads-expected-to-be-updated-in-2024/">updates to the entire iPad lineup are expected next year</a>. Notably, it has been rumored that the next iPad Air will be released in two sizes.

<br/>
Apple's supply chain started shipments of display panels for a larger 12.9-inch iPad Air this month, according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1733886638210809912">post on X today</a> from Ross Young, CEO of Display Supply Chain Consultants. Young has a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/">good track record</a> for display-related Apple rumors, so the information he shared today is likely accurate.

The Threads compose window includes a new # button to add a tag to your post. Unlike hashtags, a tag can be a word or a phrase (with spaces) and does not include the hash symbol, so tags fit into sentences more naturally. Tags can also use special characters.

Typing your tag performs a real-time search of existing tags that you can choose to use, or you can create your own tag. But users can tag only one topic per post to avoid tag spam. Users can click on a tag in a post to open all the posts in the search view.
