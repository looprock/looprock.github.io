            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the fourth-generation AirPods, Apple has eliminated the Setup Button located on the back of the Charging Case in other AirPods models. Rather than using a physical button, Apple has instead opted for a hidden capacitive button.

The hidden button for pairing and resetting the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4/">AirPods 4</a> is located at the front of the Charging Case, according to <em><a href="https://www.gearpatrol.com/audio/airpods-4-charging-case-hidden-button/">Gear Patrol</a></em>. To initiate pairing mode, the ‌AirPods 4‌ Charging Case can be opened up and then double tapped at the front where the hidden control is located. This hidden button is also used for factory resetting, and <em>Gear Patrol</em> said that either a triple tap or long press and hold gesture initiates a reset.
