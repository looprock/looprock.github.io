            Apple today announced that its retail store <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/southcoastplaza/">at the South Coast Plaza</a> shopping mall, in Costa Mesa, California, has temporarily relocated.

<br/>
Apple has opened a temporary store in the mall, just down the hall from its original location, which will presumably be renovated. The company has not indicated when the original store will reopen, but its renovations often take months.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The new Apple Watch lineup is now available to pre-order. With more feature parity than ever before across the models, understanding the differences is more important ever before.

<br/>
All three of the new Apple Watches feature the S10 chip, always-on displays, sleep score, and media playback, but there are still some significant differences between the two devices.
<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> is designed to be a low-cost option that still offers many of the Apple Watch features that have made the device so popular over the years, while the Apple Watch Series 11 offers a more feature-rich experience with additional health monitoring capabilities. The Apple Watch Ultra focuses on withstanding extreme environments, a high [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple tweaked the design of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a>, changing the fit of the tips in the ears and bringing some updates to the case. On the whole, the ‌AirPods Pro 3‌ look a lot like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2, but there are some differences to be aware of.

<br/>
<h2>Earbud Design</h2>
<br/>
Apple reengineered the ‌AirPods Pro 3‌ using more than 10,000 ear scans and more than 100,000 hours of user research.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple says internal architecture was revamped to make each AirPod slightly smaller, and the external geometry of the ear tip was aligned to the center of the body to improve stability. Basically, the ear tips are now rotated inward.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            While the AirPods Pro 2 included a USB-C charging cable in the box, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/apple-announces-airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a> unveiled on Tuesday come without one, according to Apple's website.

<br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/specs/">tech specs page for the AirPods Pro 3</a> confirms the USB-C charging cable is sold separately. In the U.S., Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MW493AM/A/60w-usb-c-charge-cable-1-m">cheapest USB-C cable costs $19</a>, but you can of course use pretty much any USB-C charging cable from any brand.

<br/>
The case for the AirPods Pro 3 can be wirelessly charged with MagSafe, Qi, and Apple Watch chargers, so a charging cable is not strictly required.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple made the visionOS 26 release candidate available to Vision Pro developers on Tuesday, and one of the more interesting additions in this version is a new Jupiter environment.

Apple previewed the Jupiter environment for WWDC attendees in June, but this is the first time that Vision Pro owners have been able to try it out for themselves in the comfort of their own home.

Jupiter is the fastest rotating planet in our solar system, with a day that is only 10 hours long, and Apple gives you a taste of it thanks to a new "Explore Jupiter" option that makes this Environment more interactive than others.
