            Apple is reportedly evaluating a tougher display film technology for its first foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> as it tests materials that could differentiate the durability and feel of the screen from rival devices.

<br/>
According to a new supply chain report from <a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=51990"><em>The Elec</em></a>, Apple is evaluating transparent polyimide film as a protective layer that would sit on top of the ultra-thin glass used in the foldable display. The report says the company is currently testing two options for this outer film: polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and clear polyimide (CPI).

The iOS 26.3 RC mentions two unreleased SoCs, T6051 and T6052, with associated H17C and H17D platform names. The 17 is a reference to the M5, as the standard M5 chip is numbered H17G.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/03/apple-studio-display-2-rumored-features/">plans to release a new Studio Display this year</a>, and it has once again been rumored that the monitor's maximum refresh rate will be 90Hz.

<br/>
In November 2024, an anonymous listener of the Relay FM tech podcast "Upgrade" claimed that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/apple-working-on-90hz-studio-display-imac-ipad-air/">developing 90Hz display technology</a> that could be used for the next Studio Display, as well as future iPad Air and iMac models. A higher refresh rate can make videos and scrolling look smoother to the eye, but 90Hz would stop short of the 120Hz refresh rate that iPhone, iPad, and Mac models with ProMotion support can achieve.

<p>This is how the new announcement economy works. You declare a massive number. The headlines write themselves. The stock moves. Mission accomplished.&quot; Whether the deal actually closes becomes almost irrelevant. The momentum already happened.&quot; As a generalized marketing strategy: &ldquo;my doctrine is that velocity has replaced authority as the organizing principle of information. What and who moves fastest wins. Truth and facts are optional and get lost in the race to dominate attention.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <blockquote>
<p>AI is still stuck in “efficiency mode.” In many organizations, a technology organization leads AI efforts and is treated as a cost center. Those CIOs are incentivized to optimize for efficiency, not growth. The result is predictable: Tech-led AI strategies deliver productivity improvements, but not transformation. Equally concerning is that technology and AI executives tell us their business partners can’t articulate what they want from AI beyond saving money. That leadership gap bleeds over into the measurement of AI value. While most agree that AI boosts productivity, only 13% report positive EBITDA impact, and fewer than a third link AI contributions to P&amp;L. Without financial accountability, AI becomes an endless pilot treadmill — producing activity without outcomes. To shift AI from incremental savings to strategic advantage, business leaders must step in, define value in P&amp;L terms, and own the linkage between AI-driven productivity and financial performance.

            Introduction Modern advertising platforms are fast-paced and interconnected: even small adjustments can have ripple effects on how ads are shown, how budgets are spent, and the value advertisers get from their ad spend. At Yelp, Ad Budget Allocation means splitting each campaign’s spend between on‑platform inventory (our website, mobile site, and app) and off‑platform inventory (the Yelp Ad Network). We optimize this split to meet advertisers’ performance goals while growing overall revenue. Due to the complexity of the budget allocation system and its feedback loop, even small changes can lead to unexpected system‑wide effects. To help us safely evaluate changes,...<br>
