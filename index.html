Adoption of the feature has been slow since Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/01/apple-shares-us-states-adopting-wallet-ids/">first announced it in September 2021</a>, with IDs in the Wallet app only available in Arizona, Maryland, Colorado, and Georgia so far.

            Yelp develops two major applications, Yelp &amp; Yelp for Business, for Web (Desktop &amp; Mobile), iOS, and Android platforms. That’s eight unique clients!

At Yelp, many product teams created SDUI frameworks for their features. Though successful, these frameworks were expensive to develop and maintain, and no single SDUI framework supported all our clients. In late 2021, we began building a unified SDUI framework called CHAOS or “Content Hosting Architecture with Optimization Strategies”....<br>
