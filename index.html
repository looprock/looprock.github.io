            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-10 04:51:31-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has added a "grounbreaking" new memory security feature to its new iPhone 17 lineup called Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE), which the company describes as "the most significant upgrade to memory safety in the history of consumer operating systems."

<br/>
The new security feature targets spyware tools like Pegasus that exploit vulnerabilities to hack targeted devices. According to Apple, MIE provides comprehensive, always-on memory-safety protection covering the kernel and over 70 userland processes, built on the Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE).
<br/>
<br/>
The new feature is supported by the new A19 and A19 Pro chips found across the iPhone 17 lineup as well as the iPhone Air. Apple says it has also added memory safety improvements for older hardware that doesn't support the new memory tagging features. [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-10 04:27:51-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Spotify has officially rolled out lossless audio streaming to Premium subscribers after years of delays. The feature, which was first promised in 2021, is gradually becoming available in 50 markets including the US, UK, Australia, and Germany.

<br/>
Thankfully, Spotify includes lossless streaming at no additional cost for existing Premium members. That's particularly good news, since early rumors suggested Spotify would offer lossless as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/17/spotify-hi-fi-premium-tier-coming-this-year/">higher-priced tier</a>. Not so. 
<br/>
<br/>
This probably has something to do with the fact that in the intervening years Apple decided to include lossless audio as part of its regular Apple Music subscription at no additional cost. Shortly after, Amazon Music, which previously ch [...]<br>
