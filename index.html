            Hello 2024! We’re kicking off the year with Dan Moore, author of ‘Letters to a New Developer’ — a blog series of letters of what Dan wished he had known when starting his developer career. We discuss the value of online communities for new developers, the importance of communication skills, and the need to stay relevant in a rapidly changing industry. Dan shares his best advice for new developers, including the importance of saying no, leaving code better than you found it, and the value of skill stacking. So much wisdom and advice in this episode!<br>

<br/>
Deepwater Asset Management's <a href="https://deepwatermgmt.com/deepwaters-2024-predictions/">annual forecast</a> for 2024 (via <em><a href="https://connectthewatts.com/2024/01/03/deepwater-predicts-apple-acquisition-of-peloton/">Connect the Watts</a></em>) says that Apple is likely to acquire Peloton sometime this year. The move would help Apple bolster its Fitness+ subscription service, adding workout equipment to compliment the Apple Watch and its existing activity tracking software. Absorbing Peloton's subscriber base of three-million users would ostensibly add about $1.7 billion to Apple's subscription revenue and line up with its continued investment in health and wellness, the company claims.

            Three hours after releasing the second betas of iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3, Apple has pulled the updates from the Developer Center and over the air, meaning they are no longer available to download and install.

Apple has removed the iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 betas after a number of people reported that the software is bricking devices.

Fortunately, it appears that Apple quickly addressed the bug with a server-side fix, and users are no longer impacted by this issue. Given it was a server-side fix, users do not need to update their devices to a newer software version for it to apply.

            <p>In the past, sellers were responsible for managing and fulfilling their own tax obligations. 
However, more and more jurisdictions are now requiring marketplaces such as Etsy to collect the tax from buyers and remit the tax to the relevant authorities. Etsy now plays an active role in collecting tax from buyers and remitting it all over the world. In this post, I will walk you through our tax calculation infrastructure and how we adapted to the ongoing increase in traffic and business needs over the years.</p>
<p><strong>The tax calculation workflow</strong></p>
<p>We determine tax whenever a buyer adds an item to their Etsy shopping cart. The tax determination is based on buyer and seller location and product category, and a set of tax rules and mappings. To handle the details of these calculations we partner with Vertex, and issue a call to their <a href="https://www.vertexinc.com/">tax engine</a> via the Quotation Request API to get the right amount to show in our buyer's cart. </p>
