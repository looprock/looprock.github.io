            <b>Published:</b> 2024-12-12 13:05:19-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's website <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">continues to state</a> that the first vehicle models with support for next-generation CarPlay will "arrive in 2024," but with less than three weeks remaining in the year, time is running short for the company to meet that objective.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
One reason to remain optimistic is that a similar situation played out last year. Apple said the first vehicles with next-generation CarPlay would be previewed in late 2023, and while that seemed more and more unlikely as the year-end approached, Aston Martin and Porsche <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/first-next-generation-carplay-vehicles-announced/">finally shared some dashboard concepts</a> on December 20. Just in time!

<br/>
That's all we have, so far, though. Concepts, leaks, and promises.

Historically, Apple has unveiled new software features at WWDC in June and then released fully complete software updates in September alongside new iPhone models.

            Apple's new Mail sorting features in iOS 18.2 are notably absent from both iPadOS 18.2 and macOS Sequoia 15.2, raising questions about the company's rollout strategy for the email management system.

            Apple Intelligence is what Apple is calling its artificial intelligence feature set, previewed at WWDC in June 2024. The first Apple Intelligence features launched with iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1, and additional features came in iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15.2. There's still more to come, though, and the rest of the Apple Intelligence features are set to come in 2025.
