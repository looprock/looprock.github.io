            Apple is expected to announce a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a> imminently, headlining with new chips. Here are all of the new features we're expecting.

<br/>
The second-generation ‌HomePod mini‌ is highly likely to contain a more up-to-date chip for more advanced computational audio and improved responsiveness. The current ‌HomePod mini‌ is equipped with the Apple Watch Series 5's S5 chip from 2019. Apple is likely to opt for the S9 chip, which was a considerable leap forward in terms of performance, or one of its derivatives such as the S10, which is a more compact iteration of the S9. 
<br/>
<br/>
The S5 chip in the ‌HomePod mini‌ is derived from Apple's A12 Bionic architecture but runs at lower clock speeds and is tuned for always-on, low-power oper [...]<br>

<p>Once you identify your style, try pushing back against some suggested changes. People reviewing your work don’t always edit with your style in mind and will think it’s appropriate to change it. This is especially true in business writing, where people expect a sort of neutral, flat tone. That can be great if that’s your thing! On the other hand, I know my style - informal, first person, how I like to tell stories to make points, etc. So when people start trying to change my style, I reject their suggestions. Editors don’t have the final word - usually, you do. At first, just do it with some minor things to build up your confidence.</p>
<p>After a while, try to insert some tricks and winks to the reader in your writing. What’s a joke or easter egg you can slip in? An absurd story is good. You’ll also develop some recurring jokes. Or maybe it’s just grammatical. Throw in a gratuitous - but grammatically correct - semicolon from tim</p> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iPhone 18 Pro models could drop the current two-tone look of the rear casing found on the iPhone 17 Pro in favor of a more seamless aesthetic, if a Chinese leaker is reporting correct information.

<br/>
On existing iPhone 17 Pro models, Apple has used a glass cutout at the back for MagSafe charging, and there is a color difference between the aluminum frame of the iPhone 17 Pro and the Ceramic Shield 2 cutout, giving the iPhone 17 Pro models a two-tone look.
<br/>
<br/>
That's set to change for the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max, according to known Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5231695562539454">Instant Digital</a>. For the next-generation models, Apple has apparently updated the back-glass "replacement process" to minimize the color difference between the glass and the aluminum frame, re [...]<br>

            Apple has teamed up with Japanese fashion house ISSEY MIYAKE to launch <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/11/introducing-iphone-pocket-a-beautiful-way-to-wear-and-carry-iphone/">iPhone Pocket</a>, a 3D-knitted limited edition accessory designed to carry an iPhone, AirPods, and other everyday items.

<br/>
The accessory is like a stretchy pocket, not unlike an iPod Sock, but elongated to form a strap made of a ribbed, elastic textile that fully encloses an iPhone yet allows you to glimpse the display through its open structure. ISSEY MIYAKE's design director Yoshiyuki Miyamae said it is inspired by the concept of "a piece of cloth," and described it as exploring "the joy of wearing iPhone in your own way." (For what it's worth, the brand's founder designed Steve Jobs' iconic black mock-turtleneck.)

<p>Five years ago, the idea of running data workloads on Kubernetes still raised eyebrows. Today, it’s the norm — and the question has changed from <em>“Can we?”</em> to <em>“How do we do it best?”</em></p>
