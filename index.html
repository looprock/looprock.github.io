            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today seeded the fourth betas of upcoming iOS 18.5 and iPadOS 18.5 updates to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming a week after Apple released the third betas.

<br/>
iOS 18.5 and iPadOS 18.5 can be downloaded from the Settings app on a compatible device by going to General &gt; Software Update.
<br/>
<br/>
So far, iOS 18.5 and iPadOS 18.5 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-5-beta-features/">are relatively minor updates</a>, introducing just a few new design changes. There are more options for reverting the Mail app back to the prior design, including removing contact photos, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a> info is easier to find. The update also likely has bug fixes and performance improvements that are less obvious.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            On iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, the Voice Memos app includes a recording feature that lets you record a second audio layer – like vocals, narration, or an extra instrument – over an existing memo, all without needing headphones. Keep reading to learn how it's done.

Thanks to the A18 Pro chip's advanced audio processing, iPhone 16 Pro models can play an original Voice Memo recording through the speakers while simultaneously isolating and capturing new audio cleanly. Whether you're capturing a quick harmony, adding context to a saved memo, or simply experimenting with sound, layering recordings like this offers a seamless way to capture richer ideas.

            <p>Let&rsquo;s get the AI to build D&amp;D adventures for us with a Model Context Protocol Prompt. I haven&rsquo;t found much value in MCP Prompts until now. What makes them excited is when you use them a &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; to chain together other tool calls. In this episode of my MCP programming series, I show you how to make two MCP Prompts. First, a simple one that boot-straps playing D&amp;D. Second, a more complex one that pulls together an adventure overview using multiple tools and &ldquo;reasoning.&rdquo; I think the result gets to a type of agentic AI.</p>

How can you make sure they don&rsquo;t forget all that loot you just got, or ensure that cobbler back in the village remembers the type of boots you orders and paid for up front? I&rsquo;ll show you how to use Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create a DM Journal. This is done by writing an MCP Server tool that write journal entries and then an MCP Server Resource that allows you to read them. It&rsquo;s just files, but it&rsquo;s a good excuse to learn some agentic AI coding in Java, with the help of Spring AI.</p>
