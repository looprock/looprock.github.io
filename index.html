The acquisition, spotted by <em><a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/02/11/faster-more-flexible-databases-could-be-coming-to-filemaker-or-iwork">AppleInsider</a></em>, was completed in October 2025 for an undisclosed sum.

AI isn’t eliminating OSS, but it is reshaping how code is written, discovered and maintained. The result may not be the death of open source, but the end of its long reign as the default foundation of modern software.<br>

<li>Customer support</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
