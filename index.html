Starting today, the 2025 Year in Review appears prominently inside the Home tab of the Apple Books app. The feature offers a personalized breakdown of each user's reading activity throughout the year, including total books completed, top genres, most-read authors, and month-by-month engagement.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-12-03 05:04:45-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is preparing to bring support for its digital car key feature to select Audi vehicles in China, based on evidence uncovered by <em>MacRumors</em> on Apple's backend.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1009335" height="715" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iPhone-Car-Key-Kia.jpg" width="1271"/>
<br/>
Specifically, the car key support relates to Audi's partnership with Chinese company FAW, which manufactures and sells Audi vehicles in the Chinese market. The joint venture produces both combustion engine and all-electric vehicles. The partnership is now on an internal Apple list of vehicles that offer car key integration, but it is not known which models the support pertains to. 
<br/>
<br/>
Last month, car key support was implemented for models produced by SAIC-Audi, another China-based collaboration that produces Audi EVs in the country. For car key to come to Audi vehicles, the automotive company will need to add the functionality.

<blockquote>
<p>Platforms, tools or frameworks that are hard for large language models (LLMs) and agents to use will start feeling less powerful and require more manual intervention. In contrast, tools that are simple for agents to integrate with and well suited for the strengths and constraints of LLMs will quickly become vastly more capable, efficient and popular.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do so by:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it simple for an Agent to get access to operating a platform on behalf of a user? Are there clean, well described APIs that agents can operate? Are there machine-ready documentation and context for LLMs and agents to properly use the available platform and SDKs? Addressing the distinct needs of agents through better AX, will improve their usefulness for the benefit of the human user.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's upcoming iPhone 17e is set to feature slimmer display bezels while retaining the iPhone 14–based OLED panel used in the 16e, according to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=44759">The Elec</a></em>.

Citing supply chain sources, the Korean-language report says BOE will again produce most of the panels for the second generation of Apple's more affordable "e" iPhone model, with Samsung Display and LG Display supplying the rest. However, the report does not claim that the iPhone 17e will feature a Dynamic Island, as has previously been rumored.

<p>Each time I write a small utility, either a command line one or for an MCP server, I need to store state and config in the file system. I’ve come up with many ways of doing it. You know, like, you want to store a default LLM prompt in a file. You want to store a D&amp;D play log in a file, or a bunch of markdown files for D&amp;D monsters. There’s more simple things: where do you put the log file?</p>
<p>There’s actually standard for how you do all of this, <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir/latest/">XDG</a>.
