            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Along with an iPhone "Fold," Apple is believed to be working on a larger foldable device that's somewhere around 19 inches, and one analyst suggests it could arrive as soon as late next year alongside Apple's rumored foldable iPhone.

<br/>
In a new research note covering likely post-tariff scenarios for Apple, investment firm GF Securities' lead analyst Jeff Pu says that both 18.8-inch and 7.8-inch foldable devices have seen development progress and are forecast to enter mass production in the fourth quarter of 2026.

Pu said as much <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/apple-foldables-mass-production-2026/">last month</a>, when he claimed that Apple's first two foldable devices had recently entered the New Product Introduction (NPI) phase at Foxconn.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today shared a minute-long video promoting the Emergency SOS feature on the Apple Watch, highlighting the rescue of Australian man Rick Shearman, who was swept out to sea last July.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Shearman was swimming in Byron Bay when rough seas pushed him away from shore, with the current carrying him over 1.5 kilometers from the beach. He couldn't get past the waves, and after about 20 minutes of trying to get to shore, he realized he needed help.
<br/>
<br/>
He called emergency services using the Emergency SOS feature on his Apple Watch, with the call played back in Apple's ad spot in a dramatic reenactment of the event. He was able to source help, and stayed on the line with emergency crews for an hour to direct them to his location. He was ultimately rescued by helicopter.

            Apple stock is on the rise after U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to pause most tariffs for a 90-day period. Tariffs are immediately on hold in countries that have not enacted retaliatory tariffs, which means this pause does not apply to China, but it is applicable in other countries where Apple suppliers operate like India, Vietnam, and Taiwan.

While Trump has paused tariffs in most countries, he raised tariffs on incoming Chinese goods to 125 percent, up from 104 percent earlier today. The 125 percent tariff is effective immediately, and comes after China raised tariffs on U.S. goods to 84 percent this morning.

            Apple employees are testing iOS 18.4.1 for iPhones, according to the <em>MacRumors</em> visitor logs, which have been a reliable indicator of upcoming iOS versions. The software update will likely be released in a week or two, if not sooner.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Postgres is a data storage tool, and as a tool it is neutral in how it is used.  Tools can be used for good, for harm, and because Postgres is open source, the community doesn't even
know how it is used.
</p>
<p>My first knowledge of non-traditional uses of Postgres was in 2003 during a Postgres <a class="txt2html" href="https://bignerdranch.com/" style="text-decoration: none;">training.</a>  During a break, someone whispered to me that one of the
attendees was from a pornographic video company, and that Postgres was very popular in that industry.  The more I thought about it, the more it made sense — many database companies
didn't want to do business with them, but Postgres was open source so they could use it easily.
</p>
<p>The flexibility of Postgres to be used without restrictions didn't become apparent to me again until 2014, when Russia invaded
