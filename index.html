            <b>Published:</b> 2023-06-13 03:09:39-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple may be forced to change the name of its new mixed reality headset in China unless it can come to an agreement with Huawei, which already owns the "Vision Pro" trademark in the country. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898794" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-at-Steve-Jobs-Theater.jpeg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
Originally spotted by <em><a href="https://news.mydrivers.com/1/915/915819.htm">MyDrivers</a></em>, the trademark was originally granted to Huawei on May 16, 2019, and gives the company exclusive rights to its use in China from November 28, 2021 to November 27, 2031.
<br/>
<br/>
Huawei actively uses the trademark in China, and offers a number of products under the Vision name, including smart TVs and smart glasses. If Apple intends to sell its headset in China and call it Vision Pro, it may have to enter into negotiations with Huawei to release the trademark for a price.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple at WWDC this week announced a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10123/">new toolkit</a> that makes it easier for game developers to port Windows games to the Mac. The toolkit provides an emulation environment that allows developers to run their existing, unmodified Windows game on the Mac and quickly evaluate how well the game could run on macOS before writing any code. A beta version of the toolkit is available for download on the Apple Developer website.

<br/>
Apple is also offering developers a new Metal shader converter that simplifies the process of converting a Windows game's shaders and graphics code to run on Macs with Apple silicon. Apple says the toolkit and converter significantly reduce the total development time required to port games to the Mac, from months to just a few days.
