            The first iPhone 16 Pro unboxing video has been shared on Weibo (via <a href="https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1835779968804024775">Majin Bu</a>), revealing Apple's new packaging design for its latest flagship smartphone.

<br/>
With Apple keen to promote its environmental sustainability credentials, there hasn't been much to the unboxing experience with recent iPhone models, and that looks to be the case even more so this year. Assuming the packaging isn't region specific, Apple appears to have done away with the little booklet containing SIM card and other basic instructions.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-09-17 02:48:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When Apple released macOS Monterey in 2021, some key features required a Mac with Apple silicon. The same scenario played out with macOS Ventura in 2022, and then again the following year with the release of macOS Sonoma. With macOS Sequoia now released, there are again new features that aren't available to Intel Mac owners.

<br/>
Apple says that macOS Sequoia is compatible with the same Macs as macOS Sonoma other than the 2018 and 2019 MacBook Air, but Apple's fine print reveals that certain new features won't work on Intel machines that are otherwise compatible with macOS Sequoia. If you're still on an Intel Mac, here's what you won't have access to.

The code refers to an unreleased Mac mini model with an Apple silicon chip and five ports, which lines up with a previous report from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman that said the next Mac mini <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/02/new-m4-mac-mini-5-usb-c-ports/">will be equipped with five USB-C ports</a>.
