            Apple's rumored in-house Wi-Fi chip might debut in devices as early as next year, according to Taiwanese industry publication <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240917PD201/apple-5g-2025-modem-chips.html"><em>DigiTimes</em></a>.

The report cites insiders from Apple's supply chain who suggested that at least some new iPad models launching in 2025 might be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi chip, although they said there is a chance that the chip might not debut until the iPhone 18 series in 2026.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18, Apple has made a significant enhancement to the Notes app, introducing a built-in audio recording feature that streamlines the process of capturing and transcribing voice notes. The new functionality is available on iPhone 12 and later models, and allows you to record audio directly within a note, eliminating the need to use separate apps or share files.

<br/>
The new audio recording tool in Notes offers more than just simple voice capture. As users record, the app automatically generates a real-time transcript, making it easier to review and search through recorded content. This feature is particularly useful for students attending lectures, professionals in meetings, or anyone who needs to quickly capture and reference spoken information.

The terms "3nm" and "2nm" describe generations of chip manufacturing technology, each with its own set of design rules and architecture. As these numbers decrease, they generally indicate smaller transistor sizes. Smaller transistors allow more to be packed onto a single chip, typically resulting in increased processing speed and improved power efficiency.

            <h1>Code to Production: From Cloud to DevOps to Platform Engineering, with Purnima Padmanabhan</h1><p>There's not that many people who've worked through the early years of cloud, the rise of cloud and IaaS, DevOps, cloud native apps, and now platform engineering...but my colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ppadmanabhan/">Purnima Padmanabhan</a> sure has. So, it was <a href="https://www.tanzutalk.com/e/purnima-career/">fun to talk with her</a> about the history of all of that - something I've been involved in and equally curious about these past 20+ years. We also discuss the differences between startups and large companies - most interestingly Purnima’s take on what large companies can learn from how startups operate. <a href="https://www.tanzutalk.com/e/purnima-career/">Listen to it here</a>, it's was a fun interview</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" href="https://www.tanzutalk.com/e/purnima-career/" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset">&lt;source typ</div></a></figure></div> [...]<br>
