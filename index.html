Apple is reportedly planning to upgrade the Vision Pro to an RGB OLEDoS display in 2027, a notable improvement over the WOLED with color filter used in the first-generation model. RGB OLEDoS technology produces light and color directly from nearby RGB sub-pixels on a single layer, putting an end to the need for a color filter.

<br/>
This results in significantly higher brightness compared to WOLED and color filter OLEDoS displays, which depend on filtering white light through an RGB color layer. It is also markedly more efficient than WO [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>We throw around the term “waste” a lot in software. It’s been around since the 2000s, at least since the Poppendieck’s book <em>Lean Software Development</em>. DevOps really took it and ran with it, it was renamed “toil” in SRE, and now the concept is pretty solidly part of how we think of software. I<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaHnNw_aWQk"> talked with Steve Pereira on what “waste” means</a> exactly. We talked about value stream maps as well, another concept that’s so common that we don’t define it much anymore. He also brought the concept of slack, which I haven’t thought of in a long time. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaHnNw_aWQk">Check out the discussion</a>!</p><div class="youtube-wrap" id="youtube2-SaHnNw_aWQk"><div class="youtube-inner"></div></div><h1>Logoff</h1><p>There’s not much going on since it’s holiday times.</p><br>
