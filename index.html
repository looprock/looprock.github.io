<br/>
The USB-C to USB-C cable supports 60W fast charging, and it has USB 2.0 data transfer speeds of up to 480 Mbps, according to one of the listings.

            Apple regularly refreshes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> models, and a new version that uses M5 series chips is in the works. Apple just finished refreshing most of the Mac lineup with M4 chips, and now it's time for the M5. Rumors suggest that we could see the first M5 ‌MacBook Pro‌ models this fall.

<br/>
<h2>Design</h2>
<br/>
There have been no rumors of a design update for the M5 ‌MacBook Pro‌ models that are coming this fall, so we are expecting the same look as the current models. There might be minor updates, but most of the changes will be internal.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple probably won't change the design of the ‌MacBook Pro‌ until it transitions to OLED display technology, and that's not rumored to happen until 2026 at the earliest.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Utah today passed the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> Accountability Act, a law that requires mobile app stores from Apple and Google to verify the age of users rather than having individual apps do age verification.

According to <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/26/utah-adopts-child-safety-law-requiring-apple-google-to-verify-user-ages.html">CNBC</a></em>, Utah Governor Spencer Cox signed the bill this afternoon. It is the first law related to mobile app store age verification that has passed in the U.S., and it will require Apple to verify user age when an Apple Account is created. If a child under the age of 18 opens an account, Apple will need to link the account to a parent's account, and parents will have to consent to app purchases.

            <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman today shared bad news for fans of the iPhone mini.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996767" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Purple-iPhone-12-Mini.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
In a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/sessions/2025-03-14/apple-s-2025-plans-and-strategy-live-q-a">live-streamed Q&amp;A session</a> today, Gurman said that Apple currently has no plans to reintroduce a smaller iPhone model.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple discontinued the iPhone 13 mini <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-iphone-13-mini/">in September 2023</a>, and it has not offered a mini model since then. Apple is not expected to release an iPhone 17 mini this year, and Gurman's revelation likely rules out an iPhone 18 mini next year too, given Apple's multi-year planning and development cycle for future iPhone models.

            Apple today shared a new "Behind the Mac" video that's focused on hit <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+ show Severance, demonstrating how Macs were used for editing the series.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The 11-minute video is accompanied by <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/how-the-mind-splitting-world-of-severance-comes-together-on-mac/">an in-depth article</a> with additional details, but be warned, there are season two spoilers in both the video and the article.
<br/>
<br/>
According to Severance editor Geoffrey Richman, the final episode of the series was one of the most difficult to edit. One scene had 70 angles and takes to choose from, so he used a single multicam clip to play nine angles simultaneously to choose the most ideal shots. There was around 83TB of footage to comb through.

Richman primarily uses an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, and because he works remotely, he connects [...]<br>

            In the United States, the Apple Card offers a high-yield savings account option, allowing you to earn far more interest on your money compared to the average bank's basic savings account. However, the account's interest rate was lowered this week, with the annual percentage yield (APY) dropping from 3.9% to 3.75%.

If you deposited $1,000 into the account, and maintained that balance for one year, you would earn $37.50 in interest based on the current APY.

<br/>
According to Gurman, the images that are "floating around" are based on "very old builds" or "vague descriptions," and are lacking key features. Gurman says that we can "expect more from Apple in June."
<br/>
<br/>
Gurman made the same comment about Prosser's mockups in his Power On discord channel. "He either has very old screenshots or hasn't seen the real thing," wrote Gurman.
