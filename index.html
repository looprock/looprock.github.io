            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple now has additional time to allow for tariffs on Chinese semiconductors, thanks to a delay on any actual cost impact until June 2027.
<br/>

<br/>
While the United States will still apply new tariffs on semiconductor imports from China, the effective tariff rate will be set at zero for approximately 18 months, according to a Federal Register <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-23912.pdf">filing</a> (via <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/23/us-china-chip-tariffs.html">CNBC</a></em>). The tariff rate will increase on June 23, 2027, with the specific percentage to be announced at least 30 days in advance. 
<br/>
<br/>
For Apple, the decision removes the near-term risk of higher import costs on a wide range of chips used across its products. While Apple designs its own A-series and M-series pr [...]<br>

            Apple reportedly tested a version of the first-generation AirPods with bright, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 5c-like colored charging cases.

<br/>
The images, shared by the Apple leaker and prototype collector known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a>," claim to show first-generation AirPods prototypes with pink and yellow exterior casings. The interior of the charging case and the earbuds themselves remain white.
<br/>
<br/>
They seem close to some of the color options offered for the ‌iPhone‌ 5c, which came in blue, green, pink, yellow and white. Apple has only ever released AirPods in white.

<blockquote>
<p>The choice of where and how to start your AI journey is a business decision, not a technology one. By grounding your AI efforts in the operational muscle you’ve already built with Java and Spring, you minimize friction and risk. Everyone just keeps doing what they’re doing, but with a new tool. This established operational and development life is the hard-won experience, paid for in decades of maintenance and gut-wrenching production failures, that gives you the platform to continuously absorb new capabilities like Spring AI and MCP.</p>
<p>Get the developer experience and the operator experience right, and you unlock the organizational velocity needed to turn tentative AI experiments into a mission-critical competitive advantage.</p>
