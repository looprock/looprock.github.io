            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's autocorrect on iPhone and iPad always aims to help when you're typing a message, but it's by no means perfect, and some of the replacements it continually spews out can be frustrating. Fortunately, Apple's software includes a feature called Text Replacement that allows you to specify what word or phrase replaces the specific text you type in. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="On my way" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036299" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/on-my-way-text-replacement.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
Even if you haven't set up Text Replacement, you can try it out with Apple's pre-set example: In any app that accepts text input, type "Omw" followed by a space, and it will change to "On my way!" automatically.
<br/>
<br/>
The following steps guide you through the process of setting up your own handy shortcut phrases with text replacements on both iOS devices and Mac.

According to people involved in the plans who spoke to the publication, the feature is internally called "Name Tag," and would let wearers identify people and get information about them via Meta's artificial intelligence assistant. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants the feature to differentiate the devices and to make the AI assistant in the glasses more useful.
