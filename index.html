            <b>Published:</b> 2024-12-19 06:55:29-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple plans to launch its next-generation Vision headsets as early as 2026, and they will likely be more affordable, <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20241219-12419.html">according to TrendForce</a>.

<br/>
In line with previous rumors, the Taiwanese research firm today said Apple is planning to introduce both a next-generation Vision Pro and a mainstream headset, which would likely be named "Apple Vision" without the "Pro" modifier.
<br/>
<br/>
For the next-generation Vision Pro, TrendForce said Apple will likely consider sourcing components from suppliers beyond Sony to reduce production costs, and this move could contribute to the headset having a lower price. Currently, the Vision Pro starts at $3,499 in the U.S., and this price has naturally limited sales of the device [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-12-19 04:41:01-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has stopped signing iOS 18.1.1, preventing iPhone users who have upgraded to iOS 18.2 from downgrading to that version of iOS. Apple released iOS 18.2 a week ago on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/apple-releases-ios-18-2-update/">December 11</a>.

<br/>
Apple often stops signing an older version of iOS, usually within a week or two after a new version is released. When an update is no longer signed, it can't be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side software verification check.
<br/>
<br/>
This policy encourages users to keep their operating systems up to date, ensuring they have the latest security enhancements. Apple also stopped signing iOS 17.7.2 on Wednesday.

Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has urged Apple to disable the Apple Intelligence notification feature, which rolled out globally last week as part of its iOS 18.2 software update. The request comes after the feature created a misleading headline suggesting that murder suspect Luigi Mangione had shot himself, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd0elzk24dno">incorrectly attributing the false information to BBC News</a>.

The 1-800-ChatGPT phone number is designed for situations where a data connection is unavailable, but a cellular connection works. With the feature, ChatGPT can provide answers to questions over the phone with voice-based responses, and even landlines are supported.
