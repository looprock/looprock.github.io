            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            There are widespread reports of Apple users being locked out of their Apple ID overnight for no apparent reason, requiring a password reset before they can log in again.

<br/>
Users say the sudden inexplicable Apple ID sign-out is occurring across multiple devices. When they attempt to sign in again they are locked out of their account and asked to reset their password in order to regain access.
<br/>
<br/>
This has led to additional Apple ID issues for users with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/enable-stolen-device-protection/">Stolen Device Protection</a> enabled who are away from a trusted location, as well as any app-specific passwords previously set up in iCloud also being reset.

Apple asks about Vision Pro satisfaction, environment usage, favorite features, what it's being used for, how often it's used, and how long usage sessions last. Apple also asks about guest mode and who else uses the Vision Pro, which is a curious question because it's not at all set up for multi-person usage. Some of the questions:

<br/>
<li>Overall, how satisfied are you with your Vision Pro?</li>

Many of the changes and improvements introduced with the third-generation AirPods originated on the first-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>. As such, it seems likely that many of the upgrades coming to the fourth-generation AirPods will be shaped by the second-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple used to regularly increase the base memory of its Macs up until 2011, the same year Tim Cook was appointed CEO, charts posted on Mastodon by David Schaub show.

<br/>
Earlier this year, Schaub generated two charts: One showing the <a href="https://mstdn.social/@dschaub/111813281624281698">base memory capacities of Apple's all-in-one Macs</a> from 1984 onwards, and a second depicting Apple's <a href="https://mstdn.social/@dschaub/111382154184733138">consumer laptop base RAM</a> from 1999 onwards. Both charts were recently resurfaced by the <a href="https://atp.fm/560">Accidental Tech Podcast</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
The graphs show that Apple tended to increase the base memory every two years or so, but that this trend ended when Cook took over the company from Steve Jobs. Memory increased quickly until the Mac Plus  [...]<br>
