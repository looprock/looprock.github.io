            Apple is testing new Purple and Green color options for the iPhone 17 base model, according to new information shared by a leaker known as <a href="https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1936061526147776765">Majin Bu</a>.

In a <a href="https://majinbuofficial.com/phone-17-new-purple-and-green-colors-in-testing-for-base-models/">blog post</a> today, Majin Bu said that only one of the two new colors might make the final cut, with Purple apparently being the more likely choice.

The base model iPhone 16 is available in five colors: Ultramarine, Teal, Pink, White, and Black.

            Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/retail/perthcity/">announced</a> that it will soon be opening a new retail store at Forrest Place, a pedestrianized area in the heart of Perth, Australia.

<br/>
The store will be in a historic building originally built for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, at the corner of Forrest Place and Murray Street. Apple is taking over a space that was previously occupied by Australian swimwear retailer City Beach.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is hiding a new ringtone within iOS 26.

<br/>
The new ringtone is an alternative version of the existing Reflection ringtone, which has been the default ringtone since the iPhone X was released in 2017. It was discovered within the code for the first developer beta of iOS 26, but it remains hidden, so you will not find it in the list of ringtones available in the Settings app for now.
<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear if Apple will move forward with releasing the ringtone in a later iOS 26 beta version.

The new ringtone was shared on X yesterday <a href="https://x.com/8810cfw/status/1935248131157049700">by the account @8810cfw</a>, in a post that was later reposted by the account <a href="https://x.com/VNchocoTaco">ShrimpApplePro</a>.

Unfortunately, this feature continues to roll out very slowly since it was announced in 2021, with only nine U.S. states and Puerto Rico offering it so far.

During its WWDC 2025 keynote last week, Apple reiterated that more states plan to offer the feature in the future, but it did not provide a timeframe.
