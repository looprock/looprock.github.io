As noted by <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/16/24322563/instagram-recap-2024-collage-story">The Verge</a></em>, the 2024 collage option comes up in the Instagram story interface. It works after an image has been added to a story and resized, with users able to select more images and rearrange them on the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Instagram has also added new year-end themed templates for the "Add Yours" feature, along with New Year and Countdown text effects, holiday chat themes for DMs, and secret phrases like Happy New Year that trigger special effects.
