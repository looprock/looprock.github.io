            Apple is opening a revamped store this weekend at Crocker Park, an outdoor shopping center in the Cleveland suburb Westlake, Ohio.

<br/>
The new store opens on Saturday, March 22 at 10 a.m. local time, <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/crockerpark/">according to Apple's website</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple's new store at Crocker Park will be larger and more modern than its original store at the shopping center, which first opened in 2008. At many of Apple's newer stores, there is an Apple Pickup station where customers can collect online orders, along with a Genius Bar with counters set at varied heights for improved accessibility.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Powerful multi-port power banks are becoming increasingly popular to keep our ever-growing array of gadgets charged up, and Alogic's new <a href="https://alogic.co/products/ark-pro-27-600mah-power-bank-with-160w-usb-charging?ref=y2uwzwu">Ark Pro power bank</a> brings some nice versatility to the table.

<br/>
I've spent a few weeks testing out the Ark Pro, and I've found that it packs a nice punch with 27,600 mAh of juice and a trio of USB ports and the ability to charge a laptop at up to 140 watts.
<br/>
<br/>
You'll find a lot of beefy power banks coming in at around this same mAh rating, and that's because 27,600 mAh translates to 99.36 Wh in this battery, which is just under the 100 Wh limit for carrying it on an airplane without needing to get approval from the airline.

<br/>
Apple's website says the extra trade-in credit for Macs is available with the purchase of an eligible new Apple device through April 2, yet the values listed have already decreased before that date, which is something the average customer likely wouldn't realize.
<br/>
<br/>
As of February 9, the listed trade-in values had increased by between $10 and $50 in the U.S., but some of the values have already decreased since then.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 06:42:47-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In an investor research note today with British bank Barclays, analyst Tim Long said Apple's first foldable iPhone could have a starting price in the $2,300 range in the United States, which would make it by far the most expensive iPhone model ever.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964745" height="1009" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-pro-models-1.jpg" width="1794"/>
<br/>
If the first foldable iPhone starts at $2,299, that means it would cost nearly twice as much as the iPhone 16 Pro Max, which starts at $1,199.
<br/>
<br/>
Long shared this pricing estimate following a recent trip to Asia, where his team met with hardware manufacturers. He said there is increasing discussion within the supply chain about a foldable iPhone launching in late 2026 to early 2027, but he believes that the device's higher starting price would unsurprisingly limit sales volume.

            YouTuber Dave Lee of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Dave2D">Dave2D</a> fame has <a href="https://youtu.be/J4qwuCXyAcU">demonstrated</a> how Apple's new Mac Studio equipped with an M3 Ultra chip can efficiently run a huge version of the DeepSeek R1 AI model locally, provided that users spec the machine with the maximum 512GB of memory.

<br/>
According to Lee's testing, the 671 billion parameter AI model can be executed directly on Apple's high-end workstation, but it requires substantial memory resources, consuming 404GB of storage and requiring  the manual allocation of 448GB of video RAM through Terminal commands.

<br/>
The M3 Ultra's unified memory architecture is key to this performance, allowing the system to handle a 4-bit quantized version of DeepSeek R1 efficiently. The quantization slightly reduces accuracy, but i [...]<br>
