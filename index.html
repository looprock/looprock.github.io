            Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">released a new update</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a>, the experimental browser that was <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/30/apple-safari-technology-preview-browser/">first introduced</a> in March 2016.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-11-12 14:50:12-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Aqara today launched its latest sensor, debuting the Presence Multi-Sensor FP300. Aqara’s sensor is able to determine when someone is in the room, providing a useful way to control HomeKit-connected lights and devices.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1026662" height="602" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/aqara-presence-sensor.jpg" width="1070"/>
<br/>
There are dual mmWave and passive infrared sensors inside the FP300, and in our testing prior to launch, the sensors worked well to detect presence and keep lights on even when sitting still.
<br/>
<br/>
A wide 120-degree field of view provides coverage of most of a room depending on where the sensor is located, and Aqara added extra sensors for ambient light, humidity, and temperature. It’s handy to have extra sensors for keeping an eye on room conditions or activating scenes based on parameters like light levels.

Unlike prior Aqara sensors that detect presence, the FP300 is battery power [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-11-12 13:59:33-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The second beta of macOS 26.2 introduces a new Edge Light feature that's designed for video calls on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> and other video calling platforms. It adds a light border around the edges of your Mac's display, providing improved lighting. Apple says that it is meant to help you look your best on video calls. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1026659" height="1293" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/apple-edge-light-macos-tahoe-26-2.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
Edge Light mimics a ring light, eliminating the need for a separate device. It can provide illumination when you're in a dark room, and customize the light to match the brightness of the ambient lighting. 
<br/>
<br/>
The Mac's Apple Neural Engine is able to detect your face, relative size, and location in the video frame to position the light appropriately, and it will fade out to allow you to access content on your screen when needed by detecting [...]<br>

            Hardware changes Apple has planned for the iPhone 18 Pro Max will make it the heaviest iPhone yet, claims a Chinese leaker.

            Apple's website is causing some confusion among Mac owners, and for good reason – its device compatibility listing for Apple Intelligence appears to have dropped support for M1 Macs.

The U.S. version of its <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence webpage</a> has been updated at the bottom to list "M2 or later" Mac models as eligible for the AI features, replacing the long-standing "M1 and later" requirement.

<blockquote>
<p>Kubernetes started as a way to orchestrate containers, but its true innovation lies in its API model. The declarative resource pattern, with its desired state, actual state and continuous reconciliation, has proven to be a universal abstraction. It works for workloads, infrastructure, policies and more. That universality is why Kubernetes has become the foundation for IDPs. It provides a consistent way to define, extend and enforce platform building blocks. Whether you’re provisioning a cloud database, managing a network policy or applying compliance rules, Kubernetes APIs make platforms programmable, predictable and composable. This API-first foundation also makes Kubernetes uniquely ready for the AI era. Agents and large language models (LLMs) don’t navigate dashboards or tribal knowledge; they interact with APIs. And Kubernetes offers a consistent, structured interface designed from Day 1 for machine-to-machine communication.”</p>

Released earlier this year, the Apple Invites app makes it easy to invite people to events, such as birthday parties and baby showers. First, you create an event invitation, which can include a description, a custom background, and even a shared photo album. Then, you can generate a link to the event that you can share with invited guests.

<p>Once you identify your style, try pushing back against some suggested changes. People reviewing your work don’t always edit with your style in mind and will think it’s appropriate to change it. This is especially true in business writing, where people expect a sort of neutral, flat tone. That can be great if that’s your thing! On the other hand, I know my style - informal, first person, how I like to tell stories to make points, etc. So when people start trying to change my style, I reject their suggestions. Editors don’t have the final word - usually, you do. At first, just do it with some minor things to build up your confidence.</p>
<p>After a while, try to insert some tricks and winks to the reader in your writing. What’s a joke or easter egg you can slip in? An absurd story is good. You’ll also develop some recurring jokes. Or maybe it’s just grammatical. Throw in a gratuitous - but grammatically correct - semicolon from tim</p> [...]<br>
