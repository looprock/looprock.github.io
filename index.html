            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is introducing a new camera-based "Capture" button on at least some iPhone 16 models this year, and a new rumor claims that Apple's own silicone cases will have a design that is specially made so as not to impede the use of the capacitive button's multiple functions.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            As Apple's iPhone 16 launch approaches, questions are swirling about a potential leap in storage capacity for the iPhone 16 Pro models. According to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/iphone-16-pro-2tb-option-rumor/">January report</a>, the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max will double their maximum storage to 2TB.

<br/>
This speculation stems from Apple's rumored adoption of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/1tb-iphone-16-pro-could-face-performance-setback/">Quad-Level Cell (QLC) NAND flash memory</a>.

<br/>
The Quattro is a Qi2 charger, so each of the magnetic charging pucks can charge an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> at up to 15W. With Qi2 support and the multi-level design, the Quattro is able to charge four iPhones at once at 15W.

<br/>
Because the charger is flat, it works with both MagSafe-compatible iPhones and older Qi devices that do not have included magnets. The charging surface can also be used for AirPods and other smartphones, but it does not work with the App [...]<br>

            There are a number of ways that Apple, Google, Amazon, Meta, ByteDance, and Microsoft are failing to comply with the Digital Markets Act, according to <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/sites/default/files/publications/BEUC-X-2024-062_Summary-non-compliance-reports-gatekeepers.pdf">an analysis published</a> by the European Consumer Organization (BEUC).

In regard to Apple, the BEUC outlines several ways that the company's DMA compliance efforts fall short, but it is worth noting that Apple has addressed many of these issues in its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/app-store-external-links-european-union/">most recent DMA updates</a>, which will be implemented starting later in 2024.
