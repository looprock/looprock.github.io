Also, full CI/CD (or just good pipeline automation) is still hovering around 50% as it has been for a decade or more: “Over half of the respondents (51%) said that their organizations are using self-service deployment pipelines to increase productivity. Another 13% said that while they’re using self-service pipelines, they haven’t seen an increase in productivity. So almost two-thirds of the respondents are using self-service pipelines for deployment, and for most of them, the pipelines are working—reducing the overhead required to put new projects into production.” // I’m a little leery of survey like this because these the conclusions you’d make from there results seem to always be the case. But also, I didn’t read it in detail.&lt;!-</p> [...]<br>

<p>I’ve been off the publishing grid for awhile, even off the consuming the Internet grid. This is a mix of partial vacation, taking care of some family things, an obsession with D&amp;D, and the first break in my workaholic nature for…20…even 30 years?</p>
<p>It is time for a few new habits, rather than swirling around the old ones. The most counter-whatyoudthink is probably to start going into the office more. My work has an OK-good office in upper west Amsterdam. It is a 40 minute bike ride, each way. That amount of biking a day would both give me more exercise than I’ve ever had in my life and also more lazy-mindfulness time than the same.</p>
<p>The office lacks offices, which is the core problem with the anti-WFH people. One, I have a whole desk studio setup for all the videos and podcasts I do. There is no place for that at a regular white-collar office. Two, I b</p> [...]<br>

            Apple is developing the next several iterations of its M-series Apple silicon chips, and the chips coming in late 2023 and 2024 will be the "M3" series. The M3 chips will use updated TSMC chip manufacturing technology to make them faster and more efficient than ever before.

            One of the common tests for whether something is trademark infringement is whether or not the public will be confused as to association between the infringer and another trademark owner. This typically comes down to several factors, such as the similarity within the uses and, importantly, whether the two entities compete in the same marketplace. [&#8230;]<br>

            Nomad today introduced its most powerful charger to date, the <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/ac-adapter-130w-usb-c">130W USB-C Power Adapter</a> that's equipped with three USB-C PD ports. The 130W adapter joins Nomad's existing 65W, 30W, and 20W adapters.

<br/>
Priced at $110, the 130W Power Adapter features the same design as Nomad's prior adapters, so if you have one of the smaller varieties, you can have a matching set. It's got a sleek black "carbide" enclosure, and it does use GaN (gallium nitride) technology to ensure a compact size.
<br/>
<br/>
I always find myself wishing Nomad made its accessories in white or other colors, but black is the Nomad aesthetic and it works. I can say without hesitation that this is the snazziest charging brick I've used, though I have to admit I don't often think too much about the  [...]<br>

            The author, who has both development and operations experience, explains how to configure Apache APISIX within containers for different environments. They detail file-based configuration using a default file and overriding values with a custom config.yaml file. The author also demonstrates environment-based configuration using environment variables to modify settings at runtime. This approach allows flexible deployment without creating separate config files. They highlight that this method applies to standalone mode with the apisix.yaml file and provides default values as a fallback. The post offers practical insights into optimizing Apache APISIX configuration for operational ease.<br>
