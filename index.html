            Privacy-focused <a href="https://alohabrowser.com">Aloha Browser</a> has announced a new Cookie Consent Management feature that aims to eliminate repetitive cookie permission pop-ups while maintaining user privacy controls.

Released today for its iOS app, the new feature allows people to set their cookie preferences once at the browser level rather than responding to prompts on every website.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today released a firmware update for the Beats Solo Buds, marking the first new software the earbuds have received since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/29/beats-solo-buds-launch-date/">their June 2024 launch</a>.
