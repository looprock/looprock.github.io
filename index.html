            Apple may be planning to release an updated Developer Strap for the Vision Pro next week, according to a hint on its website.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1023249" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/Vision-Pro-M5-Announcement.jpg" width="1960"/>
<br/>
On its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/visionos/resources/">visionOS resources page</a> for developers, Apple says the Developer Strap will be available to order again starting Wednesday, October 22, which is the same day that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/apple-announces-vision-pro-with-m5-chip/">Vision Pro with the M5 chip</a> will be released. Accordingly, it seems likely that Apple plans to release an updated version of the accessory next week.

Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-selling-vision-pro-developer-strap/">first released the Developer Strap</a> in February 2024, when the original Vision Pro with the M2 chip launched i [...]<br>

            iOS 26 was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-26-mega-guide/">released last month</a>, but the software train never stops, and iOS 26.1 beta testing is already underway.

<br/>
More features and changes will follow in future versions, ranging from later iOS 26.1 beta versions through to iOS 26.4. These are only the features that are known so far, and there will surely be many others added over the next year or so.

With Apple adopting a camera "plateau" instead of a camera bump, the camera setup for the two smartphones looks more similar than ever before. Google has used a pill-shaped multi-lens horizontal camera bar for several years now, and now Apple uses a design that's not too far off. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a>'s camera bump is wider, more square shaped, and it still has all three lenses on the left side, while Google's bar has rounded corners and lenses positioned in a row.
