            Apple today provided developers with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> beta 8, which means that beta testing is likely coming to an end. Apple typically only seeds eight developer betas of an iOS update before the software gets a final launch.

<br/>
Apple did not go beyond eight betas for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, iOS 17, iOS 16, iOS 15, iOS 14, or iOS 13. Way back in 2018, iOS 12 did have a ninth beta, a tenth beta, an eleventh beta, and a twelfth beta, but no other new versions of iOS have been updated as frequently ahead of a planned September launch date.
<br/>
<br/>
With ‌iOS 18‌, Apple released the eighth beta on August 28, and there were no subsequent betas. Since the eighth ‌iOS 26‌ beta came on August 25, the timing is similar.

Rumors suggest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a> could arrive as soon as September 2025 alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> lineup, giving prospective AirPods buyers a dilemma: snap up the proven <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2 at today's prices, or hold off for the next‑generation model that could raise the bar once again?

We've heard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/16/all-new-iphone-17-and-17-pro-colors-leaked/">multiple rumors</a> about a new iPhone 17 Pro color being a shade of orange.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models could include a reverse wireless charging feature making them capable of delivering power to other Apple devices, according to the Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/5821279480/Q1sHt7Ij8">Fixed Focus Digital</a>.

<br/>
The Chinese leaker says that Apple has tested reverse wireless charging for the company's new high-end smartphones, but whether the feature is actually enabled when the devices launch next month remains to be seen. 
<br/>
<br/>
This is the second time we've heard about the feature potentially coming to new iPhones this year. In February, Weibo leaker Instant Digital <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/Pf13JjHYa">claimed</a> that Apple had been testing 7.5W reverse wireless charging for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max, saying it could be use [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has "considered" releasing a bumper case for the upcoming iPhone 17 Air, <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1959665102313205875">according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

<br/>
Similar to the bumper case that Apple introduced for the iPhone 4 in 2010, Gurman said the iPhone 17 Air version of the case would cover the edges of the device, but not the back of it. Those bumper cases were made of rubber.
<br/>
<br/>
Given that the iPhone 17 Air is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-17-air-details-ming-chi-kuo/">expected to have an ultra-thin design</a>, customers who purchase the device might be reluctant to put it inside of a regular case, due to the added thickness. A bumper case would be a fitting compromise, as it would provide some level of protection against dro [...]<br>
