            Apple CEO Tim Cook netted around $41.5 million after taxes this week after selling 511,000 shares of Apple stock that he received as part of a performance-based award, according to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019323000089/xslF345X05/wk-form4_1696381457.xml">filing</a> released by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The stock award was determined based on Apple's total shareholder return relative to the other companies in the S&amp;P 500 between the first day of Apple's 2021 fiscal year and the final day of Apple's 2023 fiscal year.
