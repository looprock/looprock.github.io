            After a four-year absence, <em>Fortnite</em> is making its return to iPhones – but only for users in the European Union.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, Apple is requiring users to regularly reauthorize permissions for screen recording apps, a move that has not been popular with some Mac users. Popups for screen recording app permissions have been showing weekly up throughout the beta testing process, but Apple has tweaked the frequency in response to user feedback.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today stopped signing iOS 17.6, preventing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users from downgrading to that version of iOS. The update is no longer being signed after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/07/apple-releases-ios-17-6-1/">released iOS 17.6.1 on August 7</a>.

<br/>
Apple regularly stops signing older version of iOS, typically within a week or two after a new version is released. When Apple stops signing an update, it can no longer be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side software verification check, so those who have updated to the latest version of iOS cannot downgrade.

<br/>
Preventing downgrading encourages users to keep their operating systems up to date with the latest security fixes.

We discuss what it's going to take to get to alpha, the why behind Ladybird, avoiding incentives other than those of the users, their plans for incremental adoption of Swift as the successor language over C++, and of course what they hope Ladybird can achieve as a truly independent open source browser that's for the people.<br>
