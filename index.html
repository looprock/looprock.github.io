            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            At various points in Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/102/">Platforms State of the Unions video</a> for developers, a Vision Pro headset with a USB-C adapter attached to the right side of the headset can be seen, leading to some speculation <a href="https://twitter.com/M1Astra/status/1666273487017631744">on social media</a> as to what the adapter is for.

<br/>
It appears that the adapter has a USB-C cable leading to a Mac Studio <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/102/?time=4693">in one shot</a>, although there is no definitive view to confirm this. In this scenario, it is possible the adapter could provide a direct connection to a Mac for visionOS app development in Xcode, but the adapter's purpose ultimately remains a mystery for now.

            Product recommendations became increasingly popular after their introduction in retail by Amazon in 2008 and could provide a great value both for retailers and their customers. The hype led to the appearance of plenty of sometimes dangerous myths associated with product recommendations (mostly created by vendor’s sales and marketing teams). I.e. you might still see the product recommendation solution being presented as a fully autonomous magic bullet, which would increase one’s profits just after being installed on the website.<br>

            In the Newtonian system, bodies under the action of no forces move in straight lines with uniform velocity; when bodies do not move in this way, their change of motion is ascribed to a “force.” Some forces seem intelligible to our imagination: those exerted by a rope or string, by bodies colliding, or by any kind of obvious pushing or pulling. As explained in an earlier chapter, our apparent imaginative understanding of these processes is quite fallacious; all that it really means is that past experience enables us to foresee more or less what is going to happen without the need of mathematical calculations.<br>

            Coming away from all the press coverage and the demonstration videos that Apple released for its Vision Pro headset, most people would be forgiven for not realizing that there is an optional additional strap for the device that goes over the head.

<br/>
The additional strap is presumably used to better disperse weight and/or keep the headset from being easily dislodged when the wearer is moving around. It only appeared once in Apple's WWDC keynote, in a brief scene where a man stands and records a video of children playing with bubbles using the headset's outward facing cameras.

            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, Apple's new "spatial computing" device, does not have a hardware-based control mechanism.
