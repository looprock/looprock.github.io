            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            U.S. President Donald Trump will extend the looming <a href="https://tiktok.pxf.io/c/153062/2392239/27618">TikTok</a> ban for another 90 days later this week, the White House said today (via <em><a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/06/17/trump-tiktok-ban-deadline-etension">Axios</a></em>). It will be the third extension Trump has put in place since taking office in January.

<br/>
Trump's second TikTok extension will expire on June 19, and there appears to be no sign of a deal with China that would allow TikTok's U.S. operations to be sold to a U.S. company.
<br/>
<br/>
TikTok has been banned in the United States since January 19 due to the passing of the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, but Trump's extensions prevent the U.S. Department of Justice from enforcing the law and allow TikTok to r [...]<br>

            iOS 26 includes three small but meaningful changes for screenshots.

<br/>
The upcoming software update adds a new Screen Capture menu to the Settings app, under General. In it, there are a few useful toggles.
<br/>
<br/>
First, there is now an option for HDR screenshots. When this format is selected, any HDR photos or videos in screenshots will actually appear in HDR with full dynamic range, when viewed on newer iPhone models and other supported devices.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple says HDR screenshots use the HEIF image format. There is still an option for SDR screenshots, which are saved as PNG files.
<br/>
<br/>
Second, CarPlay screenshots finally work on an opt-in basis. On iOS 18 and earlier, taking a screenshot on an iPhone connected to CarPlay generates both iPhone and CarPlay screenshots. Starting with iOS 26, however, onl [...]<br>

            iPhone sales climbed 15% year-over-year during April and May, signaling Apple's strongest two-month performance for the period since the pandemic, according to preliminary data from Counterpoint Research's <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/report/market-pulse-early-look-oem-sales-may-2025">Market Pulse Global Monthly Smartphone Sales Report</a>.

<br/>
The growth was driven mainly by the United States and China, Apple's two largest markets. Both regions returned to positive year-over-year growth after three years of declines during what is typically a less seasonal period. China sales were particularly notable, with Apple capturing the top spot in May. It's quite the turnaround, after Apple only recently sustained market share losses to Huawei and other local mobile vendors.
