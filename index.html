The <a href="https://www.eufy.com/products/t8417121?variant=44434340446394">Eufy Indoor Cam E30</a> features a 4K resolution for crisp, sharp video, and it is compatible with HomeKit.

The E30 connects via the 2.4GHz Wi-Fi band, and the PTZ camera provides a 360-degree view in the horizontal plane, as well as controls within the Eufy app to manually adjust the angle. The camera can also be fixed to ceilings with a mounting plate (included).

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple in iOS 18.2 has reinstated a Lock Screen feature that was unceremoniously nixed from its iPhone OS two years ago, leaving many users wondering why it was taken away in the first place.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The feature in question is the on-screen volume control slider in the Lock Screen media player interface. Prior to 2022, the volume slider was a familiar presence on the Lock Screen whenever media was playing. When Apple released iOS 16, however, it removed the control without explaining the reason.
<br/>
<br/>
Thankfully, Apple has brought back the control as an option in iOS 18.2. If you've updated your device, you'll find a toggle in <strong>Settings ➝ Accessibility ➝ Audio &amp; Visual</strong>, labeled <strong>Always Show Volume Control</strong>. Enable the switch, and you'll be able to adjust volume from the Lock Screen  [...]<br>
