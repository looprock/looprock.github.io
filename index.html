Apple's stock (AAPL) has nearly risen 40% in 2024. Before the markets opened on December 27, Apple's market capitalization stood at $3.92 trillion, leaving the company just a modest surge in stock value away from the unprecedented milestone. The growth is said to have been fueled largely by optimism surrounding <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> and the continued strength of its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> upgrade cycles.

<a href="https://www.lux.camera/the-road-to-halide-mark-3/">Halide "Mark III"</a> is set to gain one-tap color grading. Color grading has been a highly requested addition since the launch of Process Zero, Halide's proprietary image processing system, which debuted in 2024. The feature is expected to allow users to apply professional-grade film looks instantly, similar to the capabilities offered in Lux's Kino app. Lux envisions this feature going beyond presets, potentially enabling users to import custom looks created by others.
