            <b>Published:</b> 2023-10-27 11:52:49-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple earlier this week surprised us with an unexpected October event, and curiously, it is set to take place on Monday, October 30 at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time. Apple has never hosted a nighttime event before, so Monday should be quite interesting.
<br/>

<br/>
The "Scary Fast" event will be focused on the Mac, which has been confirmed by Apple's artwork for the event. On Apple's website, there is an Apple logo that morphs into the Mac Finder icon, so it's Macs that we're going to see.
<br/>
<br/>
Rumors have been mixed about what we can expect at the event, but it's sounding like we'll get the entire M3 chip lineup. We've outlined what we've heard is coming, but we might also get some unexpected announcements.

When users get directions for driving, walking, or cycling, Google Maps now offers a "multidimensional experience" that can be used to preview bike lanes, sidewalks, intersections, and parking along the route, <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/google-maps-october-2023-update/">according to Google</a>.
