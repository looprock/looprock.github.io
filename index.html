            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>In 2020, Etsy concluded its migration from an on-premise data center to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). During this transition, a dedicated team of program managers ensured the migration's success. Post-migration, this team evolved into the Etsy FinOps team, dedicated to maximizing the organization's cloud value by fostering collaborations within and outside the organization, particularly with our Cloud Providers.</p>
<p>Positioned within the Engineering organization under the Chief Architect, the FinOps team operates independently of any one Engineering org or function and optimizes globally rather than locally. This positioning, combined with Etsy's robust engineering culture focused on efficiency and craftsmanship, has fostered what we believe is a mature and successful FinOps practice at Etsy.</p>

            <h1>Have you tried having less?</h1><p>Standardized. Centralized. Consistent. Those words I use over and over when talking about platforms. In large organizations, you’ve got hundreds, even thousands, of applications. There are likely tens of “platforms”: the stacks of runtime and middleware goo that all those apps run on. Maybe even hundreds if the company is large enough, old enough, and has gone through enough acquisitions (most all global banks). </p><p>The more of those platforms your have, the more time you’ll spend managing them, governing them, securing them, and figuring out how to trouble-shoot problems.  This is just, like, intuitively the case: instead of knowing how one thing works, you need to know how five (ten, 20, etc.) things work.</p><p>Here’s a chart on all this from <a href="https://go-vmware.broadcom.com/2024-State-of-Cloud-Native-App-Platforms?utm_source=cote&amp;utm_campaign=devrel&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_content=newsletter20240617">our recent State of Cloud Native Platforms </a></p> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Popular audio company Sonos recently updated its U.S. privacy policy to make a small but notable change that seemingly puts customer data at risk. As noted by Louis Rossmann (via <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178433/sonos-privacy-policy-customer-data-controversy">The Verge</a></em>), the new Sonos privacy policy removes a line about not selling customer data.

<br/>
In the 2023 version of its privacy policy, Sonos had this sentence: "We do not and will not sell your personal data to third parties." The statement has been removed from the 2024 version of the privacy policy in the United States, though it is still present in privacy policies in other countries.

Emergency SOS now supports live video, which means once the SOS feature is activated, streaming video and recorded media can be sent to emergency personnel.

            One of the Apple Intelligence features coming in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> is Genmoji, which will allow <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users to use AI to generate all-new emoji characters based on text input. The Genmoji will look similar to emoji, but are custom created, according to an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10220/">iOS 18 WWDC session focused on Genmoji</a>.

Emoji are not images, but are instead pictographs that are encoded in the Unicode Standard and rendered by each platform. Emoji are added by the Unicode Consortium, which raised some questions about how Apple's Genmoji solution will work.

            The Home app in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> allows <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> users who have more than one device that serves as a home hub to select which one should be used as the preferred hub. It is a small but useful change because it prevents ‌HomeKit‌ from choosing a hub that is further away from most ‌HomeKit‌ products or that has a weaker connection.

<br/>
In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> and earlier, there has been no way to select a home hub, and ‌HomeKit‌ has picked randomly.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple plans to overhaul the design of its TestFlight app that is available to developers for beta testing their apps, and the updated design was highlighted in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkeUvZ4NRhg">WWDC session on App Store Connect</a>.

<br/>
TestFlight in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> features a new invitation experience that will better showcase the app by highlighting key information including app name and icon, screenshots, developer name, build expiration date, and app description.
<br/>
<br/>
The refreshed design looks much more similar to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> than the current TestFlight interface, which provides little in the way of app data beyond the features that are being tested. Apple's current design assumes that t [...]<br>

<br/>
Priced at $79.99, the Beats Solo Buds feature up to 18 hours of battery life, a USB-C carrying case, and Find My support on both iOS and Android. However, they lack active noise cancellation, and the carrying case does not have a built-in battery and can only charge the earbuds when a USB-C cable is connected to an external power source.
