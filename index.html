            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple could debut LOFIC camera sensor technology in its 2027 iPhone lineup, according to new information coming out of Korea. The tech would allow iPhones to capture photos with far more detail in both bright and dark areas of the same shot without losing information in either.

<br/>
LOFIC, or Lateral Overflow Integration Capacitor, is a next-generation imaging technology that enables each pixel to store varying amounts of light based on scene brightness. This allows a sensor to capture detail in both bright highlights and dark shadows within a single frame, potentially reaching up to 20 stops of dynamic range – comparable to high-end cinema cameras and approaching the range of human vision.

            Apple intends to equip next year's iPhone 18 Pro models with a variable aperture lens, according to a Chinese leaker with information allegedly sourced from Apple's supply chain.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1018297" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/iPhone-17-Pro-Cosmic-Orange.jpg" width="1960"/>
<br/>
According to the Weibo account <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/Qb3zgwSl7">Digital Chat Station</a>, the main rear camera – what Apple calls the 48-megapixel Fusion camera – on both iPhone 18 Pro models will offer variable aperture, which would be a first for the iPhone. The leaker also claims that the devices' main and telephoto lenses will feature a larger aperture.
<br/>
<br/>
A variable-aperture system physically adjusts the lens opening, letting more light in for low-light shots or narrowing the opening for brighter scenes and deeper depth of field.

<p>I’d tl;dr Claude CLI skills as “low/no/english code MCPs'”.  Seems helpful in the way that local utility scripts are today.</p>

<p>That is a good way of putting it.</p>
<p>I haven’t done heavy experimenting, but I think there’s a distinction between:</p>
<p>(1) The Skill has no code, except maybe code fragments.</p>
<p>Most of it is just a SKILL.md file with a spec, almost narrative of what to do.</p>
<p>In this mode, the new thing is being able to mess around on the command line, even execute those code snippets.</p>
<p>(2) The Skill has code</p>
<p>And then you can, of course, put code and executables in your skill and tell it to run it.</p>

            <p>There&rsquo;s a lot of knowledge work that can be automated: &lsquo;Where Altman’s comment holds water is in what it hints at, even if it doesn’t spell it out. Most jobs aren’t fake, but many have accumulated layers of automatable junk: compliance checklists, reports nobody reads, emails summarizing meetings that could’ve been Slack threads. That’s the kind of “game-playing” work LLMs are already good at. When Altman says these models will wipe out tasks, not just roles, this is what he likely means. And on that point, he could be right.&rsquo; // If it&rsquo;s bullshit work, have the bullshit artist do it.</p>

            <p>You can ask Claude to make you quick D&amp;D maps. This is useful if you’re solo roleplaying with it. As you create encounters together, having a map is good for tracking complicated situations and getting spatial awareness. The only thing is you’re making very crude vector maps (SVGs), not the more realistic ones that ChatGPT will make. It feels like it takes just as long to make the initial map, but so far they’re less cheesy and more useful - utilitarian. Also, the first map is usually fine for using. The result is you don’t slow down play by spending a lot of time making and refining a map.</p>
