            The latest rumored specs for the iPhone 17 base model are underwhelming.

<br/>
In a research note with equity research firm GF Securities this month, Apple analyst Jeff Pu said that the lowest-end iPhone 17 model will be equipped with the same A18 chip that is used in the iPhone 16 base model. The chip will continue to be manufactured with TSMC's second-generation 3nm process, known as N3E, he said.
<br/>
<br/>
The ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air is expected to have an A19 chip, while the iPhone 17 Pro models are expected to have an A19 Pro chip. Both of those chips are expected to be manufactured with TSMC's third-generation 3nm process, known as N3P.

Despite the ongoing focus in the industry on generative artificial intelligence, Apple is reportedly planning to debut a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ios-19-macos-16-major-design-update/">complete visual redesign</a> of its platforms as "the highlight of the show" at WWDC.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-05-30 08:42:22-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In macOS, a handy option called "Show suggested and recent applications in Dock" (found in <strong>System Settings ➝ Desktop &amp; Dock</strong>) adds a divider to the right-hand side of your Mac's Dock, and after it displays any apps you recently used – or any that macOS thinks may be useful to your workflow – that aren't permanently docked. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="settings" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003600" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/show-recent-apps-dock.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
Assuming that you have no undocked apps that are currently open, the right side of the divider shows three of the most recently used apps that have since been closed. However, there is a way to make it show more, which can be useful if your workflow involves using a lot of undocked apps consecutively.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're comfortable pasting commands into Terminal, it's perfectly possible to increase or decrease the number of recently opened apps that show in your Dock.

CarPlay Ultra is currently limited to luxury Aston Martin vehicles in the U.S. and Canada, but Apple said that many other automakers around the world are working to offer it within the next year.

We asked more than a dozen automakers about their CarPlay Ultra plans, and we have rounded up their responses below.

With a budget of $75 million, Danny Boyle's 28 Years Later will become the first major blockbuster movie to be shot on ‌iPhone‌. 28 Years Later is the sequel to "28 Days Later" (2002) and "28 Weeks Later" (2007), which depict the aftermath of a zombie-style pandemic in the United Kingdom.

            <p>I’m thinking through the topic of ROI for infrastructure software again (obviously for our PaaS stuff). I get asked about this every year or two. Each time I look at it, I get more confused. This ask always come from sales, presumably because the buyers are asking it. But, I don’t think the ask is about the basic ROI calculations: the amount we paid for this tech is less than the amount of money we make using it.</p>
<p>First, that is a very difficult thing to figure out with infrastructure software. What is the ROI of Linux (I guess I mean RHEL), Java, or a laptop?</p>
<p>In each of those cases, the ROI could be infinite: if you didn’t have them, your business would not function.</p>
<p>In other cases true ROI is zero: there is no direct cause between having a laptop and increasing margins on USB cables by 0.5% because your supply chain negotiator could type on a laptop, maybe even accessing the intranet for contract templates with a VPN while they were waiting for their flight to board.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the next-generation version of iOS and other 2025 software updates, Apple is planning to change its numbering scheme. Rather than iOS 19, which would logically follow <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple is instead going to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-ios-26/">call the update iOS 26</a>. Apple plans to use 26 across all of its platforms (the number representing the upcoming year), which will presumably be less confusing than having iOS 19, macOS 16, watchOS 12, and visionOS 3. But what does the change mean for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>?

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-05-29 13:42:03-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has announced that its <a href="https://www.apple.com/nl/retail/denhaag">Den Haag store</a> in the Netherlands will be temporarily closed for renovations starting this Sunday, June 1.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003475" height="1612" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/Apple-Store-Den-Haag.jpeg" width="2880"/>
<br/>
The store is located in The Hague, the capital city of South Holland.
<br/>
<br/>
First opened in 2014, Apple Den Haag is one of the company's flagship stores, located in a covered walkway with historical architecture. The remodeled store will likely feature an Apple Pickup station for online orders, improved accessibility, and more.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not indicated when the store will reopen, but remodeling often takes months.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple has two other stores in the Netherlands, in Amsterdam and Haarlem.

You’ve likely experienced this peculiar phenomenon: despite sharing the same route and traffic signals, you inevitably encounter a red light while the other vehicle passes through seconds earlier. For a moment, you might think they’ll reach their destination first. However, as you continue, you’re surprised to find them waiting at another red light just a few blocks ahead. This dance continues for a while. The ‘notes’ of this ‘song’ are the micro-random events inherent in traffic: a flock of pigeons crossing the road, a cyclist approaching, a sudden lane change by the vehicle in front. Some factors are more deterministic: weather conditions, road closures, or construction delays, others less so.</p><p>As a seasoned data scientist, your mission is to uncover hidden patterns within chaotic system</p> [...]<br>
