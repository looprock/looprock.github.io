            A <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2024-us-automotive-performance-execution-and-layout-apeal-study">new survey released last week by J.D. Power</a> shows that U.S. consumers continue to prefer vehicles with support for Apple CarPlay.

<br/>
The market research firm's annual U.S. Automotive Performance, Execution, and Layout (APEAL) Study found overall satisfaction with in-vehicle infotainment systems to average 805 on a 1,000-point scale. However, satisfaction was higher among owners who use Android Auto (832), and even higher for those who use CarPlay (840). 
<br/>
<br/>
The study is based on responses from 99,144 owners of new 2024 model-year vehicles in the U.S. who were surveyed after 90 days of ownership, according to J.D. Power. The study was conducted from July 2023 through May 2024.

            The upcoming iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are "widely expected" to support Wi-Fi 7, according to <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240729PD219/wi-fi-7-2025-ai-pc-iphone.html">Taiwanese supply chain publication <em>DigiTimes</em></a>.

<br/>
Wi-Fi 7 support would enable the devices to send and receive data over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously, resulting in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. Wi-Fi 7 is expected to offer peak theoretical data transfer speeds of over 40 Gbps, a 4× increase over Wi-Fi 6E.

Wi-Fi 7 support for iPhone 16 Pro models was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/">previously rumored by supply chain analyst Jeff Pu</a>. The devices should be released in September.
