            Polkadot is a crypto project developed in 2016 to facilitate communication and interoperability between blockchains. 

It uses a multichain system with two blockchains: relay chains, and parachains, and offers parallel processing and GRANDPA, a consensus model that validates transactions quickly. 

It allows for the developing of new blockchain applications in De-Fi and play-to-earn games. 

Polkadot's base token, DOT, is used by validators and nominators to confirm transactions and earn rewards. 

Polkadot was developed by Dr. Gavin Wood, Ethereum's co-founder, and has become one of the top innovative projects in the crypto ecosystem.<br>

            Mrs. Ferrars died on the night of the 16th–17th September—a Thursday. I was sent for at eight o’clock on the morning of Friday the 17th. There was nothing to be done. She had been dead some hours.
It was just a few minutes after nine when I reached home once more. I opened the front door with my latch-key, and purposely delayed a few moments in the hall, hanging up my hat and the light overcoat that I had deemed a wise precaution against the chill of an early autumn morning. To tell the truth, I was considerably upset and worried. I am not going to pretend that at that moment I foresaw the events of the next few weeks. I emphatically did not do so. But my instinct told me that there were stirring times ahead.
From the dining-room on my left there came the rattle of tea-cups and the short, dry cough of my sister Caroline.<br>

According to Apple, users can open up Shazam, tap the blue button, and switch back to the app that was in use to see what's playing. The Shazam app engages the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s microphone to hear the song, and it is able to listen while the other app is in use.

<em>If you are going to be involved in crypto, you must know that the crypto industry is composed of many niches/sectors; potentially, one of the most important segments of this burgeoning digital economy is the smart contract platforms.</em></p>
<p>:::</p>
<p>\
Smart contract platforms are the digital nation-state-level ecosystems that provide the security, computation, and infrastructure to support the development of applications and house the economic assets that underpin global transactional activities.</p>
<p>\
Here is a reference to the Top 10 Smart contract platforms, in my personal opinion (not market capitalization). I will provide a playful summary, including a brief description, background, and some technical specs. At the end of each asset, I will provide a grade for the project and whether or not I would consider investing in it. For the love of god, please don't take anything as investment advice; this is just for information.</p>

            Whether your iPhone or iPad is long overdue a battery replacement, or you just want to get more juice out of a single charge, here's a way to keep your device's Low Power Mode on all the time.

<br/>
Most ‌iPhone‌ and iPad users will be familiar with the way their device throws up a prompt to turn on Low Power Mode when the battery falls to 20 percent. The special mode conserves what remaining battery life the device has left by limiting some features, but by default the mode automatically turns off when a charging iPhone or iPad reaches 80 percent. If that irks you, don't worry – there is a solution.

Perhaps you're running the latest version of iOS or iPadOS on an older device and you've found that the battery life is inadequate to get you through the day. Or maybe you just want to reduce the amount [...]<br>
