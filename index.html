            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-04 15:43:46-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            We have just a few more days to go until Apple's September 9 "Awe Dropping" event that will see the introduction of the Apple Watch Series 11. No design changes are expected this year, but there could be some internal updates.
<br/>

<br/>
<h2 id="updated_modem">Updated Modem</h2>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Series 11 is rumored to be getting a MediaTek modem that supports 5G RedCap, a 5G service designed for wearables that don't need standard 5G speeds. 5G RedCap should still bring speed improvements over the LTE that's in the current Series 10.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="new_chip">New Chip</h2>
<br/>
Apple has a new S11 chip in store for the Series 11, but it will have the same processor as the Series 10. We're not expecting speed improvements, but the chip could be smaller, providing more space for other internal components.

            Ecovacs today announced the launch of its latest vacuuming and mopping robot, the Deebot X11 Omnicyclone. The HomeKit-compatible vacuum has several new features, including battery improvements, support for agentic AI and a 4WD climbing system that can cross higher room thresholds.

<br/>
The X11 includes PowerBoost GaN fast-charging technology, allowing the robot to charge incrementally while cleaning its mop and emptying its dust container. The rapid bursts of charging power ensure that it cleans for a longer period of time without needing to stop for a long recharge.
<br/>
<br/>
Unlike prior versions of the Ecovacs robots, the X11 has an upgraded Omni Station that no longer requires a dust bag. Instead, there is a PureCyclone dust container that collects dust vacuumed up by the bot. Ecovacs says that the updated system uses a mult [...]<br>
