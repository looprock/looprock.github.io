            Apple registers many patents most of which never see the light of day as consumer products – <em>officially</em>, that is. One burgeoning knock-off merchant in China has apparently taken cues from an idea Apple had in 2021 for AirPods featuring a case with a built-in touchscreen display.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-03-14 03:37:02-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's first-generation Vision Pro headset is an "over-engineered devkit" that ships with more sensors than is necessary to deliver Apple's intended experience. That's according to Hugo Barra, former VP of Android and head of Meta's phased-out Oculus headset brand.

<br/>
Barra, who oversaw the Oculus team in 2017 after it was acquired by Facebook, has published a surprisingly balanced <a href="https://hugo.blog/2024/03/11/vision-pro/">in-depth analysis</a> of Apple's spatial computing device, which is well worth a read.

            The U.S. House of Representatives today approved legislation that would force TikTok owner ByteDance to sell the social media network or face a ban in the United States. The Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act will now go to the Senate, where its fate is unclear.

<br/>
U.S. lawmakers want TikTok to be sold to a company outside of China due to concerns that the Chinese government could force ByteDance to hand over data from users located in the United States. If China made the request, ByteDance would not be able to refuse. There have also been suggestions that China could use TikTok to spread political propaganda.

            What is Engineering Effectiveness Metrics (EE Metrics)? EE Metrics was envisioned as a hub that helps teams manage their technical debt. EE Metrics provides every team with a detailed web page that contains information about technical debt that needs to be addressed. It also serves as a platform to highlight top engineering initiatives at the organization level. EE Metrics empowers infrastructure teams to surface important migrations or metrics that could improve the health of software projects. Organization-wide migrations of technologies can often be difficult to surface and keep track of. General EE Metrics lifecycle Figure 1: Diagram showing how EE...<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-03-12 16:45:30-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today stopped signing iOS 17.3.1 preventing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users from downgrading to that version of iOS. iOS 17.3.1 is no longer being signed following the March 5 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-features/">release of iOS 17.4</a>, an update that introduced app ecosystem changes in the EU, new emoji, and more.

<br/>
Apple routinely stops signing older versions of iOS, so it is not unusual that the iOS 17.3.1 update is no longer available. Apple prevents users from installing older versions of iOS to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date and to prevent downgrading to older, less secure versions of the ‌iPhone‌ operating system.

iOS 17.4 is now the only publicly released version of iOS available. <br/>This articl [...]<br>
