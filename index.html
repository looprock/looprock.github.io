            <b>Published:</b> 2024-09-15 07:15:31-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has increased its out-of-warranty battery replacement fee for iPhone 16 Pro models, according to its <a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair">iPhone repair and service page</a>.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple Stores can replace the battery inside an iPhone 16 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro Max for $119 in the U.S., which is up from $99 for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. This is a 20% increase to the fee, which includes the cost of a new battery and service by an Apple Store. The fee may vary at third-party Apple Authorized Service Providers.
<br/>
<br/>
The fee remains $99 for the standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus.
<br/>
<br/>
Customers with AppleCare+ can still get an iPhone 16 Pro battery replaced for free, but only if the battery retains less than 80% of its original capacity.
