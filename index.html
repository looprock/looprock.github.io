            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Starting with iOS 17, the Wallet app on iPhone may be able to show balances for a wider range of credit cards set up with Apple Pay, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-02/apple-wwdc-2023-mixed-reality-headset-ios-17-and-other-products-to-expect">report today from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. Currently, only the Apple Card's balance can be viewed in the app.

<br/>
"The Wallet app will get an upgrade as the company pushes deeper into financial services," wrote Gurman. "That could include the app tying deeper into third-party credit cards to show balance information, mirroring the experience of the Apple Card."
<br/>
<br/>
Like many other financial-related features, it is possible that the expanded credit card balance feature would only be available in the U.S. at launch.

            "Stray," an adventure game that lets players take on the role of a cat, will soon be available on the Mac. Introduced in 2022, Stray has previously been limited to Windows machines and PlayStation consoles.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
In Stray, a stray cat finds himself stuck in a walled city filled with robots and mutant bacteria. The cat must make his way back up to the surface with the help of B-12, his drone companion.

Stray offers third-person gameplay and it requires players to solve puzzles, bypass obstacles, and complete quests while avoiding monsters like Zurks (evil bacteria) and Sentinels (security bots). Much of the game is platform-based, involving climbing up various obstacles and interacting with the environment to open up new pathways. There are cat behaviors too, of course, such as sneaking, sleeping, meowing, and nuzzling up to NPCs to get pets.

            Apple plans to add the original 12-inch MacBook to its obsolete products list on June 30, according to an internal memo obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>. Once classified as obsolete, the laptop will no longer be eligible for repairs or service at Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers, as parts will no longer be available.

Apple classifies a product as technologically obsolete once more than seven years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The action-adventure survival game "No Man's Sky" is now available for the Mac <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/">on Steam</a>, with "another surprise" from studio Hello Games to follow in the "near future."
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
At WWDC last year, Apple announced that No Man's Sky would be available for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and Mac would by the end of 2022. Hello Games missed that deadline and the game is finally available for the Mac as of today. Hello Games founder Sean Murray teased two upcoming Apple-related announcements earlier this week. Today, Murray seemingly confirmed that the launch for Mac is one of the two teased announcements, meaning another is soon to follow.
