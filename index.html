            <h1><em>Balancing Engineering Ambition with Product Realism</em></h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In July of 2023, Etsy’s App Updates team, responsible for the Updates feed in Etsy’s mobile apps, set off with an ambitious goal: to revamp the Updates tab to become Deals, a home for a shopper’s coupons and sales, in time for Cyber Week 2023.</p>
<p>The Updates tab had been around for years, and in the course of its evolution ended up serving multiple purposes. It was a hub for updates about a user’s favorite shops and listings, but it was also increasingly a place to start new shopping journeys. Not all updates were created equal. The most acted-upon updates in the tab were coupons offered for abandoned cart items, which shoppers loved.</p>
<p>We spotted an opportunity to clarify intentions for our users: by refactoring favorite-based updates into the Favorites tab, and (more boldly), by recentering Updates and transforming it into a hub for a buyer’s deals.</p>

Mint added support for the ‌Apple Card‌ back in 2022, but Apple did not provide the same integration to other third-party apps. Intuit folded Mint into Credit Karma at the beginning of the year, though, leaving former users not interested in Credit Karma without a way to track their ‌Apple Card‌ transactions. ‌Apple Card‌, Apple Savings, and Apple Cash accounts can now be added to select budget apps.
