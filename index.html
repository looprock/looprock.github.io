            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Let&rsquo;s get the AI to build D&amp;D adventures for us with a Model Context Protocol Prompt. I haven&rsquo;t found much value in MCP Prompts until now. What makes them excited is when you use them a &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; to chain together other tool calls. In this episode of my MCP programming series, I show you how to make two MCP Prompts. First, a simple one that boot-straps playing D&amp;D. Second, a more complex one that pulls together an adventure overview using multiple tools and &ldquo;reasoning.&rdquo; I think the result gets to a type of agentic AI.</p>

How can you make sure they don&rsquo;t forget all that loot you just got, or ensure that cobbler back in the village remembers the type of boots you orders and paid for up front? I&rsquo;ll show you how to use Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create a DM Journal. This is done by writing an MCP Server tool that write journal entries and then an MCP Server Resource that allows you to read them. It&rsquo;s just files, but it&rsquo;s a good excuse to learn some agentic AI coding in Java, with the help of Spring AI.</p>

            Bethesda has something of a history of embracing its modding communities. This has historically included not being aggressive on matters of IP against modders, attempting to build an economy around the modding community itself, and even being quite tolerant of fan-made expansions and the like of the publisher&#8217;s titles.

In 2020, Google added a function to its Chrome browser called Scroll to Text Fragment (STTF) that helps you achieve this. It allows URLs to link directly to any visible text on a page. You may have seen it work in Google Search, where clicking on a link in your returned results takes you to a highlighted passage of text further down the page.
<br/>
<br/>
Since then, Google has built the feature into the open source Chromium code, so most other popular Chromium browsers like Edge, Opera, and Vivaldi also have it these days. (Brave is an exception, citing &lt;a href="https://github.com/WICG/scroll-to-text-fragment/issues/76 [...]<br>

            <p>Not only can you give more direction to the AI when you&rsquo;re playing solo D&amp;D with it, you can start to understand how it thinks.

Also, I show you how to do logging despite the weird setup Claude Desktop requires.</p>
<p>More generally, you get to see why doing more documentation is important for agentic tools like Model Context Protocol. You have to shift from thinking like a programmer making APIs to thinking like a prompt engineer having a conversation with the AI.</p>

The ambitious timeline would require Apple to double its current iPhone production capacity in India. It marks a major acceleration of Apple's supply chain diversification strategy, which has been gradually expanding in recent years.

This change would further blur the lines between the iPad and the Mac. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman previously claimed that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/13/ipados-19-more-like-macos/">iPadOS 19 will be "more like macOS,"</a> with unspecified improvements to productivity, multitasking, and app window management, and the addition of a macOS-like menu bar would certainly align with that overall plan.

In a blog post today, the leaker also claimed that iPadOS 19 will enhance Stage Manager, the feature that lets you use multiple apps at once on an external display.  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            A leaker known as <a href="https://x.com/majinbuofficial">Majin Bu</a> today claimed that iOS 19 will enable support for at least a limited version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/stage-manager/">Stage Manager</a> on iPhone models with a USB-C port.

<br/>
In a <a href="https://majinbuofficial.com/ipados-19-and-ios-19-new-features/">blog post</a> citing sources, the leaker said that when an iPhone with a USB-C port is connected to an external display, users will be able to take advantage of a Stage Manager-like interface with multiple apps open at once on the screen. However, he said that there might be more limitations compared to Stage Manager on iPads.

            <p>D&amp;D battle maps are one of the funnest parts of D&amp;D. Just <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/illuminatedcodex/search/battlemaps">looking at them is fun, finding them can be a tiny thrill, and making them is a delightful way to spend hours of time</a>. Oh, and using them. I’ve used Midjourney to make D&amp;D battle maps in the past, <a href="https://cote.io/2024/04/03/creating-huge-dd.html">especially to make really large battle maps</a>. That works great! ChatGPT was never that good at it, until now.</p>
<p>Recently, while playing through <em>Sons of Gruumsh</em>, I asked it to make a few maps, and ChatGPT did great. What was especially surprising was that I hadn’t really described what I wanted the map to look like, I just had the adventure text and some brief description of the areas.</p>
<p>First, it made this regional map:</p>

            <p>Playing D&amp;D with ChatGPT, Claude, or whatever is fun. But sometime you want more control over how it behaves and what it does. Check out this video for a quick tutorial on creating an oracle plugin for Claude. This &ldquo;plugin&rdquo; is a Model Context Protocol Server written in Java using Spring AI. Once you create the MCP Server, you can hook the oracle into Claude which will use it while you play as a simple yes/no oracle. This is a simple example that will show you how to get everything setup with Java and Spring AI to start making MCP Server tools. Keep an eye out for the rest in the series where I&rsquo;ll make much more complex and fun tools.</p>
