Huawei hasn't yet officially shown off the pocketable phone, which reportedly has a 10-inch display when completely unfolded, but the company has shared a teaser on Weibo that depicts a device with three folding sides in a sort of reverse Z-shape, leaving little to the imagination about what's headlining the event.

<br/>
According to <em><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Supply-Chain/Japan-no-longer-iPhone-display-supplier-as-Apple-ends-LCD-use">Nikkei Asia</a></em>, the move away from LCD displays will exclude two longstanding Japanese panel makers, Japan Display (JDI) and Sharp, from Apple's iPhone supply chain. 
<br/>
<br/>
In 2017, Apple introduced OLED screens with the iPhone X. Since then, OLED displays have replaced LCD screens in Apple's high-end iPhone models. This shift has significantly impacted LCD suppliers. In 2015, JDI and Sharp provided about 200 million LCD panels yearly for iPhones.

Like the iPhone 15 series, this year's lineup is expected to stick with four models – iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max – although there are plenty of design differences and new features to take into account.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple will likely announce new Mac models with M4-series chips in November, confidential information obtained by <em>MacRumors</em> claims.

<br/>
According to a reliable source familiar with the matter, Apple will release new Mac models in November 2024. While new Macs are usually released toward the end of the year, this is the first time a launch month has been singled out for the upcoming M4 Macs.
<br/>
<br/>
This does not discount the possibility of Apple holding an event in October to announce the new machines.

It may also make some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/30/apple-september-2024-event-new-products-expected/">additional new products available</a>, but there are a handful of rumored upcoming devices that we don't expect to make an appearance this month.
