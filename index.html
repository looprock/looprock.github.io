            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's Beats brand today shared a new ad in its ongoing Pill People series, this time highlighting the various USB-C cables that Beats <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/15/beats-charging-cables/">debuted earlier this week</a>.
<br/>

<div class="center-wrap"></div>

The Pill People ad campaign features anthropomorphized Beats Pill speakers with different personalities. Beats has been using the Pill People since it launched the updated Beats Pill <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/25/beats-pill-bluetooth-speaker-announced/">last summer</a>.

Apple's Beats brand is now offering several USB-C cables, including USB-C to USB-C, USB-C to USB-A, and USB-C to Lightning. The cables come in 1.5-meter and 20-centimeter options, with both sizes priced at $18.99.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Google has an illegal monopoly in online advertising, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema said today. Google is guilty of "willfully acquiring and maintaining monopoly power" in the publisher ad server market that websites use for ads and the open-web display ad exchange market that matches advertisers with websites.

<br/>
Publishers that wanted to use Google's ad exchange were also required to use its ad server, which disadvantaged competing platforms. Google's "First Look" feature gave its ad exchange the first right of refusal for impressions, and "Last Look" let its platform assess bids from competitors before making its own bid.

Google later rolled out Unified Pricing Rules limiting the pricing strategies that publishers used to reduce dependence on Google ads and screen out low-quality content, which th [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18.4, Apple added a new Shortcuts action to open a specific conversation in the Messages app. This means it's now possible to open a chat thread with someone important to you straight from your Lock Screen, for example. Keep reading to learn more.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iPhone development roadmap runs several years into the future and the company is continually working with suppliers on several successive iPhone models simultaneously, which is why we often get rumored features months ahead of launch. The iPhone 17 series is no different, and we already have a good idea of what to expect from Apple's 2025 smartphone lineup.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If you skipped the iPhone 16, or if you're just plain curious about what's on the horizon, here are 17 rumored features that we are expecting to arrive in time for Apple's successor lineup, the iPhone 17 series, which is likely to be released around mid-September.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has seemingly had one of its most useful AI tools blocked from Meta's apps. Writing Tools, which is an Apple Intelligence feature, is not available to use in Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, and Messenger.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Apple's Writing Tools include options to proofread, rewrite, and summarize text almost anywhere you can type in iOS 18. A long press in a text input field usually brings up the feature, but not in any of Meta's apps currently.

<br/>
Brazilian blog <em><a href="https://sorcererhat.tech/articles/meta-impede-o-uso-da-apple-intelligence-em-seus-apps">Sorcererhat Tech</a></em> spotted the lack of Writing Tools across Meta's apps. Developers can choose whether to allow the tools in their apps, so it looks as if Meta has declined the offer.

Introduced in the United States in 2022, as part of iOS 16.1, the optional Clean Energy Charging feature enables iPhone users to charge their devices at times of the day when the electric grid is relatively cleaner. Apple says the feature can reduce your carbon footprint by selectively charging when lower carbon-emission electricity is available.

            With iOS 18.4, Apple added support for robot vacuums to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a>. There are a few Matter-enabled robot vacuums that can be added to the Home app for use with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, including the Deebot X8 Pro Omni from Ecovacs. I've been testing the X8 Pro Omni for the last several weeks to see if it's worth upgrading to a robot vacuum with Matter support to integrate with ‌Siri‌ and ‌HomeKit‌, as well as to check out its cleaning capabilities.

The X8 Pro Omni is a circular vacuum that can both vacuum and mop, so it is an all-in-one floor cleaning bot. It comes with a base that has a dust bag, section for cleaning fluid, a tank for clean water, and a tank for dirty water.
