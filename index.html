            Apple today shared a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpnizY19kEM">teaser video</a> for <em>Pluribus</em>, an upcoming sci-fi drama series hailing from <em>Breaking Bad</em> creator Vince Gilligan.

Pluribus stars Emmy-nominated actress Rhea Seehorn, who also starred in the <em>Breaking Bad</em> spinoff series <em>Better Call Saul</em>. In the "genre-bending" series, Apple says "the most miserable person on Earth must save the world from happiness."

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Earlier this year, Apple finally <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/apples-carplay-ultra-now-available/">launched CarPlay Ultra</a>, the long-awaited next-generation version of its CarPlay software system for vehicles. However, now nearly five months later, CarPlay Ultra is still limited to just one luxury vehicle brand.

<br/>
CarPlay Ultra features deeper integration with a vehicle's instrument cluster and systems, built-in apps for radio and climate controls, rear-view camera feed support, and more. The connected iPhone provides app-related data, while the vehicle provides information like the current speed, fuel level, tire pressure, engine temperature, and more.
<br/>
<br/>
The interface is tailored to each vehicle model and automaker's identity, and drivers can choose from various preset design options.

            <p>Imagine you have a fabulous idea to drive more sales on Etsy by giving out <em>free ice cream</em> with every purchase. How would you know if it will actually work?</p>
<p>One way to test this out is to run an <strong>experiment</strong>! An experiment is a learning tool that can help us see if a new change really affects user behavior and key metrics we care about. At Etsy, we run nearly 2000 experiments a year for testing new ideas to improve the user experience for our buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>For our ice cream idea, we could set up our experiment as an A/B test on the listing page, where one group of users (the “control” group) sees the usual “Buy it now” button, while the other (the "treatment" group) sees a shiny new version that says, “Buy it now and get a FREE ICE CREAM!”.</p>
