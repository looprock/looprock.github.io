<br/>
Pixelmator recently added support to the app for vector PDFs, which allows users to import image, shape, and text elements in the portable document format as separate layers. 
<br/>
<br/>
With the newest version, this support has been expanded so that users can edit imported text as regular text layers. In practice, this means existing text in PDFs can be more easily replaced, formatted, and styled using Pixelmator Pro tools. As the developers explain:

In iOS 17.4, released last month, Apple no longer limits EU users to the handful of browser options that iOS currently offers as alternatives in other parts of the world.

The change has led to a sharp increase in third-party browser usage, based on several reports. On Wednesday, [...]<br>

Quartiles tasks you with combining tiles to form words and earn points. Each puzzle starts with a grid of 20 tiles, and words can be formed with one to four tiles. A quartile is a four-tile word, and if you find all five in each puzzle, you earn a 40-point bonus. The website <em>Gadget Hacks</em> shared a <a href="https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/apple-has-killer-new-word-game-puzzle-called-quartiles-hiding-ios-17-5-0385513/">walkthrough of the game</a> with more details.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>For about 7 months, I’ve been playing solo D&amp;D with ChatGPT. I prompt ChatGPT to be the “ChatDM.” It sort of works, and at least, it’s fun enough to keep doing it and working on making it better. Here’s my most recent overview of what works and doesn’t work, based on a longer play session this week:</p>
<p>In addition to the obvious prompting to play as a DM, there are a few things you have to be specific about. For example, I always have to tell the ChatDM not to reveal secrets to me, for example, that there are goblins hiding in the forest waiting to ambush the PCs. Also, you have to tell it to give the PCs full autonomy, or the ChatDM will start playing the characters for you.</p>
<p>This week, the ChatDM was pretty good at combat, but I had to give it some coaching here and there. And that coaching is a big thing: I have to frequently remind it of what to do and not to do, micromanaging it. There are a few other lessons learned in the video.</p>
