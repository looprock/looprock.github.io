<p id="ol34ib">The key issue seemed to be that comments weren’t loading when you were browsing Reddit’s website when not logged in. In an Incognito Chrome window on desktop, I could see that people posted comments but couldn’t actually see what they wrote. At the bottom of the screen, Reddit’s website showed messages that said, “We had a server error...” I saw this issue when logged out on Reddit’s mobile website as well.</p>
