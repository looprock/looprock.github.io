            On iPhone 15 models, iOS 18 will recommend that users set a particular charging limit for their device based on their recent usage habits, with the aim of potentially improving their iPhone battery's lifespan by reducing the time that the battery is fully charged.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> has added a new multicolor swatch to the Font &amp; Color customization options on the Lock Screen, so now you can display the time in rainbow colors against your chosen wallpaper.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955111" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/clock-color-ios-18.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
Unlike the other color swatches, the multicolor option does not currently apply to widgets and the date, which turn white when the rainbow effect is applied. However, there's a good chance this is something Apple intends to implement but has not yet got around to doing so in the developer beta.
<br/>
<br/>
‌iOS 18‌ also allows users to change the two Flashlight and Camera shortcut buttons on the Lock Screen to an action of their choice for the first time.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-06-12 04:21:43-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, Apple has introduced a new window tiling management feature that aims to make it easy to arrange open windows into a layout that works best for you. 
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
PC users have had tiling since at least Windows 7 and Aero Snap, and if you've ever used those, the new window tiling feature in ‌macOS Sequoia‌ will be familiar. In the absence of the feature, Mac users have relied on several third-party tools like Magnet, Moom, and Rectangle to achieve similar results, but as things stand, in beta 1, window management in macOS still needs some work before it can approach the utility of those apps.

Apple offers five colors, including purple, pink, orange, mint, and blue, and there is no option for custom colors.

The five color options are useful for highlighting select words and passages in text. Multiple colors can be used in the same sentence, but it is worth noting that there does not seem to be an option for colored text without the shaded background, or bla [...]<br>
