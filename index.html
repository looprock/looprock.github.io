            <b>Published:</b> 2025-01-28 11:19:17-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            There are two new speculative execution attacks that impact recent Apple chips, according <a href="https://predictors.fail">to data shared today</a> by Georgia Tech students that discovered the vulnerabilities.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987547" height="1013" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/slap-flop-vulnerabilities.jpg" width="1800"/>
<br/>
Named SLAP and FLOP, the two security flaws could allow an attacker to use a malicious webpage to spy on the contents of other webpages, giving attackers remote access to browsing history, credit card data, emails, location information, and more. Physical access to a device is not required, and the attack can be executed through a malicious site that bypasses Apple's browser protections.
<br/>
<br/>
Several Apple A-series and M-series chips are affected, including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> and later and the A15 and later, which are in the following devices:

            CVS is testing a new feature that is designed to allow <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and Android users to unlock product cabinets to retrieve an item without the need to summon an employee, reports <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cvs-wants-to-help-you-spend-less-time-in-cvs-84fdb56b">The Wall Street Journal</a></em> (via <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/597939/cvs-app-open-locked-cabinets-feature">The Verge</a></em>).

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is continuing to promote the Beats Pill speaker, today sharing a new Valentine's Day-themed short ad that uses the cute anthropomorphized "Pill People" characters to highlight battery life.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The spot features the red Beats Pill holding up a be mine sign and playing music in a Say Anything-esque scene. The white Beats Pill walks by and asks how long the red Beats Pill has been outside playing music. "17 hours," replies the speaker, before an end tag comes up that points out the device's 24-hour battery life.
<br/>
<br/>
"Nobody ❤️s a 24-hour battery life like we do. And did you know 2 Beats Pills can be paired together for increased volume? Sounds like a sign to us," reads the ad's description.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple's Beats brand introduced the new version of the Beats Pill <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/25/beats-pill-bluetooth-speaker-announced/">in June of last year</a>, after the prior Pill+ version was discontinued in early 2022. The  [...]<br>

<p>As part of that process, Etsy recently adopted <a href="https://developer.android.com/compose">Jetpack Compose</a> – Android's modern toolkit for defining native UIs – as our preferred means of building our Android app. The process of adoption consisted of a gradual expansion in the size and complexity of features built using Compose, eventually culminating in a full rewrite of one of the primary screens in the app. The results of that rewrite gave us the confidence to recommend Compose as the primary tool for our Android engineers to build UIs going forward.</p>
