            <p>Business models are fascinating. Most business models come down to a type of arbitrage, at least as I understand it. You find something you have that you can sell to someone else, crucially, at a price above what it cost you to make that thing.<a class="footnote-anchor" href="https://cote.io/feed.xml#footnote-1" id="footnote-anchor-1" target="_self">1</a> In, let’s call it, The Capatalist Upbrining, there is a major intellectual jump where you understand that the price for a think is not determined by what it cost to make it, the costs of goods sold. No, no - not at all. How much it cost to make a thing has little to do with what price the thing sells for. And there’s the arbitrage: a business model is all about making the difference between the cost of goods sold and the price paid for goods as big, large, and mysterious as possible.
