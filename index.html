            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Apple Watch Series 10 will include a new sleep apnea detection feature, but it may not be available as soon as the new model launches, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-06/apple-sept-9-event-preview-iphone-16-apple-intelligence-airpods-and-watches"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

<br/>
Sleep apnea detection, which builds on the watch's existing sleep tracking, will attempt to determine if a wearer has sleep apnea and then suggest further testing with a medical professional.

Gurman had expressed doubt about the feature's inclusion in the 2024 Apple Watch model, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/series-10-larger-screens-and-faster-chip/">previously reporting</a> that Apple's efforts hadn't gone smoothly and that it had "run into some serious snags."

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is expected to offer both the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max with a minimum of 256GB storage, doing away with the 128GB starting option on its smaller Pro model for the first time, according to a new TrendForce report.

Ahead of the launch of the iPhone 15 models, there were rumors that the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max could start at $1,199, instead of the $1,099 starting price it charged for the iPhone 14 Pro Max. 
<br/>

            Well-known accessory maker Twelve South has introduced the first-ever <a href="https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/plugbug-multiport-usbc-charger-with-find-my">USB-C wall chargers</a> with built-in support for Apple's Find My app.

<br/>
If you ever misplace these chargers, you can simply open the Find My app on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac and track the location of them. The chargers do not need to be plugged in to an outlet for Find My functionality to work, as they are powered by a replaceable button-cell battery, just like Apple's AirTag. Twelve South says the battery should last about a year, and the battery's charge level can be monitored in the Find My app.

<br/>
When Apple Watch Ultra 2 debuted last year, key new features included a 50% brighter display, a faster S9 chip, a "Double Tap" gesture for interacting with the watch without touching the screen, on-device Siri, and increased internal storage. Unfortunately, the next version of the device is unlikely to reach those lofty heights. Here's what the rumors say.

            Last September, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-finewoven/">stopped selling genuine leather accessories</a> in favor of a more environmentally friendly "FineWoven" material, but it did not go down well with customers, and dwindling stock leading up to Apple's iPhone 16 event on September 9 has many people wondering if Apple is about to pull the plug on FineWoven for good.

<br/>
The company describes FineWoven as "luxurious and durable microtwill," and sells FineWoven iPhone cases at $59, MagSafe Wallets at $59, AirTag holders at $35, and Apple Watch bands at $99.
