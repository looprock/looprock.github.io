            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's User Privacy Engineering Manager Katie Skinner and Privacy Product Marketing Lead Sandy Parakilas recently sat down with YouTuber Andru Edwards for a wide-ranging discussion on Apple's privacy policies.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Topics covered include Apple's approach to privacy, the ways Apple contends with privacy laws in different countries, and how Apple deals with government requests, plus there's a good deal of information on the new features in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Some of what's discussed covers privacy information that Apple has reiterated over and over again, but there are some interesting tidbits on Apple's adoption of ChatGPT, Maps privacy, the Passwords app, and accessory pairing in ‌iOS 18‌.

Kuo expects the device to be equipped with a 6.6-inch display with a current-size Dynamic Island, a standard A19 chip rather than an A19 Pro chip, a single rear camera, and an Apple-designed 5G chip.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Taiwanese research firm TrendForce this week <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20240722-12228.html">said</a> it anticipates that Apple will begin releasing iPhones with quad-level cell (QLC) storage by 2026.

<br/>
QLC is a denser storage technology compared to the triple-level cell (TLC) technology used for storage chips in existing iPhones, and this would allow for higher storage capacity within the same physical footprint. In addition, QLC storage is typically less expensive than TLC in terms of price per gigabyte. However, one downside is that QLC storage typically offers slower read and write speeds compared to TLC storage.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-07-24 04:06:13-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iPhone will adopt a new 1/2.6-inch 48MP Ultra Wide CMOS image sensor (CIS) made by Samsung as early as 2026, breaking Sony's years-long monopoly as Apple's CIS supplier, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

<br/>
Writing in a brief report <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1816057976358330824">published on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Kuo said Samsung has already established a dedicated team within its ranks to work on the camera components with a view to specifically supplying Apple. 
<br/>
<br/>
For years now, Apple has exclusively sourced CIS for its iPhones from Sony. However, recent developments suggest a strategic shift away from the Japanese supplier due to concerns about reliability and Apple's need to integrate new technologies into its camera system.
