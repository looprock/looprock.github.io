            The upcoming iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are "widely expected" to support Wi-Fi 7, according to <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240729PD219/wi-fi-7-2025-ai-pc-iphone.html">Taiwanese supply chain publication <em>DigiTimes</em></a>.

<br/>
Wi-Fi 7 support would enable the devices to send and receive data over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously, resulting in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. Wi-Fi 7 is expected to offer peak theoretical data transfer speeds of over 40 Gbps, a 4× increase over Wi-Fi 6E.

Wi-Fi 7 support for iPhone 16 Pro models was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/">previously rumored by supply chain analyst Jeff Pu</a>. The devices should be released in September.

The fourth-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ is rumored to feature an iPhone 14-like design with an OLED display, Face ID instead of Touch ID, a USB-C port, an Action button, and an all-screen look that does away with the Home Button. The device's display is expected to grow in size from 4.7 inches to 6.06 inches and use OLED for the first time.

BOE will be the primary supplier of the OLED panels, with LG Display providing backup, according to today's report. In previous years, Apple has solely tasked China-based BOE to supply LCD-based iPhone SE panels. But BOE has struggl [...]<br>

With the update, you can tap on the record button in the top left corner after placing a call. Everyone on the call is notified that the call is being recorded through an audible message. There is no confirmation dialogue, so if a person wanted to not be recorded, they would need to hang up.
<br/>
<br/>
Once the call is in progress, the audio is recorded and saved to the Notes app. Recorded phone calls can be opened from Notes, and you can re-listen to the call, view a full transcript, and get a summary from the transcript without having to re-listen to the entire thing.
