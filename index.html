            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> is a standalone hardware device that has its own processors and does not require a connection to a Mac or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to operate, but it is able to interface with other Apple devices.

The neck and breast are changeable in color according to the light in which they are seen, and shine with a metallic luster, in which sometimes purple and sometimes golden green dominates.”
“That is exactly the ordinary plumage of our pigeons,” said Emile. “When they come and peck the bread that I crumble for them in the sun, I like to see their magnificent breasts shining first with one color and then with another, every time the bird moves.”<br>

            iOS 17 includes several improvements to the Health app, including new <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/health/">mental health and vision health features</a>. Another useful addition to the app is follow-up reminders for scheduled medications, in case you forget to mark them as taken.

<br/>
When the setting is turned on, the Health app will send you follow-up reminders if you have not logged a medication 30 minutes after the initial notification. There is also an option to have follow-up reminders sent as critical alerts that appear on the Lock Screen and play a sound, even if a Focus mode is turned on or the iPhone is muted.
