            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple in macOS Tahoe 26.2 introduced Edge Light, a clever new feature that turns your Mac's display into a virtual ring light during video calls. Instead of fumbling with external lighting equipment, your Mac can now illuminate your face automatically when you're sitting in a dark room.

<br/>
Basically, Edge Light adds a soft glow around the edges of your display to brighten your face during video conferences. But it's far from just a simple screen border effect. Edge Light uses your Mac's Neural Engine to analyze your face, size, and position in the frame to deliver accurate lighting, while the Image Signal Processor fine-tunes brightness to match your environment.

<br/>
The feature is even aware enough to know when your cursor approaches the display edge. When it does, Edge Light automatically recedes, a [...]<br>

Kuo said in a <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/iL4L5hcO7csXvK">new research note</a>:

<blockquote>"Development of the foldable iPhone is behind earlier expectations, but the product is still expected to [sic] announce in 2H26. Due to early-stage yield and ramp-up challenges, smooth shipments may not occur until 2027. With limited supply and expected strong demand, the foldable iPhone could be facing shortages until at least the end of 2026."</blockquote>The warning suggests Apple's ambitious foldable device will face manufacturing hurdles when it enters mass production.

            Apple is working on a 24-inch iMac featuring an OLED display, with the aim of completing development as early as 2027, claims a new report out of Korea.

<br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=45518">The Elec</a></em>, Apple has sent requests for information to Samsung Display and LG Display regarding development of a 24-inch OLED panel for the iMac. Current 24-inch iMacs use a 4.5K Retina display, which is an LCD panel with LED backlighting.
<br/>
<br/>
The specs apparently being discussed include 600 nits of brightness and a pixel density of 218 PPI. If accurate, that would match the current 24-inch iMac's resolution but deliver a 20% brightness boost over the existing 4.5K Retina display's 500-nit maximum, making it equivalent to the brightness of Apple's Studio Display – though that also us [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            An internal Apple kernel debug kit suggests Apple has tested a MacBook with the A15 chip, alongside a separate A18 Pro-based MacBook that appears to be closer to a shippable product.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The information comes from internal kernel debug kit files used by Apple engineers. The kit was accidentally released on Apple's website earlier this year, but it was quickly pulled after information started leaking out of it.
<br/>
<br/>
Within the Mac-related entries, there is a line that explicitly describes an unreleased MacBook configuration running an A15 chip. The row appears under a project label "mac14p" on a platform labeled H14P. <em>MacRumors</em> believes this A15 MacBook corresponds to the codename J267.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has made the battery replacement process easier for the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro, allowing users of its self-service repair program to replace just the battery, without removing other internal components.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030447" height="2160" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/macbook-pro-m5-battery-replacement@2x.jpg" width="3840"/>
<br/>
Before now, manual battery replacement on what is currently Apple's only M5-powered MacBook Pro required swapping out several modules alongside the battery itself. However, the new process Apple has introduced only requires removing the bottom case and the battery management unit flex cable before accessing the battery.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple is now selling standalone battery modules through its <a href="https://selfservicerepair.com/en-US/macbook-pro-14-inch-m5/battery">Self Service Repair Store</a>. Apart from the cost of the necessary repair tools, the replacement battery costs $209.25, and user [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Unlike some Android phones, iPhones don't have a dedicated notification LED that lights up when you get a call, text, or other alert. What iPhones do include is an optional Accessibility feature for the deaf and hard of hearing that blinks the rear camera flash and provides a visual cue for incoming notifications. And in iOS 26.2, Apple has added the ability to flash the front display, too.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025699" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-flash-alert.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
Even if your hearing is fine, having a visual cue for incoming alerts can be handy to have if, say, you're in a quiet environment like a library and don't want to create a disturbance. What's more, in iOS 26.2, you can choose for both the display and the camera LED to flash. That way, you'll see the alert flash whichever way your iPhone is lying on a table.
