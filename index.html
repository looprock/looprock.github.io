            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is investigating an issue where the display brightness briefly flickers or "pulses" on some Apple Watch models when Always On mode is enabled, according to an internal service memo shared with Apple Authorized Service Providers today.
<br/>
<br/>

The memo does not indicate which Apple Watch models are affected, but the issue appears to be most prevalent on the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 models released last month. There are complaints from customers about this issue across the <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-9-flickering-when-raising-to-wake-on-10-0-2.2407076/">MacRumors Forums</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/16y6ssa/apple_watch_ultra_2_screen_flickering/">Reddit</a>, and the <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255165682">Ap</a> [...]<br>

            X, the social network formerly known as Twitter, <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-x/not-a-bot">today announced</a> that it is testing a "Not A Bot" program that charges new, unverified users $1 per year to post and interact with content on X.

<br/>
Not A Bot is being tested in New Zealand and the Phillipines at the current time, and it only applies to new users. The X support account says that existing users are not affected "within this test."
<br/>

Charging users $1 per year is meant to "reduce spam, manipulation of [the X] platform, and bot activity." X claims that subscription options have "proven to be the main solution that works at scale" to combat these issues.<blockquote>This new program aims to defend against bots and spammers who attempt to manipulate the platform and disrupt the experience of oth</blockquote> [...]<br>

            A higher-end <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> with a mini-LED 32-inch display will come out in 2025, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1714350456565350625">Apple analyst Ming-Chi</a> Kuo. Kuo does not specify, but this machine could be positioned as an "‌iMac‌ Pro" to replace the 2017 model that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/19/imac-pro-officially-discontinued/">discontinued two years ago</a>.

Kuo's prediction is in line with previous rumors from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, who has also said that a new ‌iMac‌ is likely to come in 2024.

Kuo does not mention which chip Apple will use, but Gurman has claimed that Apple will use the M3 chip in the ‌iMac‌. The M3 chip is expected to feature an 8-core GPU and 10-core GPU, and because it is built on a new 3-nanometer process, it will have performance and efficiency improvements.
