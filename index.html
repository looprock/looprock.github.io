            <b>Published:</b> 2025-12-17 07:19:11-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            An internal Apple kernel debug kit suggests Apple has tested a MacBook with the A15 chip, alongside a separate A18 Pro-based MacBook that appears to be closer to a shippable product.
<br/>

<br/>
The information comes from internal kernel debug kit files used by Apple engineers. The kit was accidentally released on Apple's website earlier this year, but it was quickly pulled after information started leaking out of it.
<br/>
<br/>
Within the Mac-related entries, there is a line that explicitly describes an unreleased MacBook configuration running an A15 chip. The row appears under a project label "mac14p" on a platform labeled H14P. <em>MacRumors</em> believes this A15 MacBook corresponds to the codename J267.

In the same dataset, there is also a separate MacBook entry tied to the A18 Pro. It has the identifier J700 and is describe [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has made the battery replacement process easier for the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro, allowing users of its self-service repair program to replace just the battery, without removing other internal components.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030447" height="2160" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/macbook-pro-m5-battery-replacement@2x.jpg" width="3840"/>
<br/>
Before now, manual battery replacement on what is currently Apple's only M5-powered MacBook Pro required swapping out several modules alongside the battery itself. However, the new process Apple has introduced only requires removing the bottom case and the battery management unit flex cable before accessing the battery.

<br/>
Apple is now selling standalone battery modules through its <a href="https://selfservicerepair.com/en-US/macbook-pro-14-inch-m5/battery">Self Service Repair Store</a>. Apart from the cost of the necessary repair tools, the replacement battery costs $209.25, and user [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Unlike some Android phones, iPhones don't have a dedicated notification LED that lights up when you get a call, text, or other alert. What iPhones do include is an optional Accessibility feature for the deaf and hard of hearing that blinks the rear camera flash and provides a visual cue for incoming notifications. And in iOS 26.2, Apple has added the ability to flash the front display, too.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Even if your hearing is fine, having a visual cue for incoming alerts can be handy to have if, say, you're in a quiet environment like a library and don't want to create a disturbance. What's more, in iOS 26.2, you can choose for both the display and the camera LED to flash. That way, you'll see the alert flash whichever way your iPhone is lying on a table.

A macOS kernel debug kit distributed by Apple earlier this year included information on a number of upcoming devices, including the ‌HomePod mini‌ 2.

The garbage collector quietly does its job, and unlike C or C++, we rarely think about malloc or free. This doesn’t mean that there are no memory leaks in Python. Reference cycles, unreleased resources like connection pooling, global caches, etc can slowly inflate your process’s memory footprint. You might not notice it at first, until your worker starts OOM-ing, latency creeps up, or container restarts become mysteriously frequent.</p><p>In this post, we’ll share the story of a real-world memory leak we encountered during a Python upgrade — how we discovered it, the tools and techniques we used to investigate, and the lessons we learned.</p><h3>What happened after upgrading to Python 3.10?</h3> [...]<br>
