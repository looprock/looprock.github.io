            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>A little while ago, Etsy introduced a new feature in its iOS app that could place Etsy sellers' artwork on a user's wall using Apple's Augmented Reality (AR) tools. It let them visualize how a piece would look in their space, and even gave them an idea of its size options. When we launched the feature as a beta, it was only available in "wall art"-related categories, and after the initial rollout we were eager to expand it to work with more categories. </p>
<p>What differentiates Etsy is the nature of our sellers’ unique items. Our sellers create offerings that can be personalized in numbers of ways, and they often hand-make orders based on demand. Taking the same approach we did with wall art and attempting to show 3D models of millions of Etsy items – many of which could be further customized – would be a huge undertaking. Nevertheless, with inspiration from <a href="https://careers.etsy.com/global/en/guiding-principles">Etsy's Guiding Principles</a>, we decided to dig deeper into the feature. What could</p> [...]<br>
