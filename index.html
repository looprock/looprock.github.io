            Gradle version catalogs allow us to add and maintain dependencies in an easy and scalable way. Apps grow, and managing projects with several development teams increase the compilation time.

To address this issue, one potential solution involves segmenting the project into multiple modules. Compiling these modules in parallel and solely recompiling modified portions reduces the overall compilation time. However, a predicament arises: how can we effectively share common library dependencies and their respective versions, while evading compilation errors and the necessity to manually scrutinize Gradle files in each module to prevent synchronization issues?<br>
