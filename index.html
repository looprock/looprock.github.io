            <b>Published:</b> 2024-08-07 07:00:17-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18, currently in beta, Apple has broadened the customization options for the Home Screen on iPhone, and thanks to a new setting it is now possible to make app icons and widgets bigger by hiding their labels. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960988" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/big-icons-home-screen.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
With the setting enabled in iOS 18, the names of apps are removed from the grid, which increases the size of the icons and widgets on your Home Screen with the space saved. With larger icons, you still get a maximum of six icon rows with four icons each, the same that you're limited to when icon names are turned on.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're familiar enough with your favorite apps that you don't feel the need to see the names underneath the icons, then it's worth giving it a try. With the labels removed, the design of your app icons takes center stage, resulting in a cleaner look for your Home Screen. Note that [...]<br>

            Google has <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-nest/google-tv-streamer/">announced</a> the Google TV Streamer, a new device that replaces the Chromecast and directly rivals the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> 4K.

<br/>
The discontinuation of the Chromecast marks the end of an era for Google's original streaming dongle, which has been a staple in the market since its launch in 2013. Over 100 million Chromecast devices were sold during its 11-year run.

            Apple is considering launching the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup in Korea earlier than usual due to weakening demand in China, the <a href="https://koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2024/08/133_380047.html"><em>Korea Times</em></a> reports.

<br/>
If correct, this would mark a significant shift for Apple, as Korea has not been part of the initial release countries since the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 3GS in 2009. Apple is expected to launch the ‌iPhone 16‌ lineup in mid-September, with an announcement on the 10th being the most probable date based on the company's historical patterns.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-08-07 05:11:24-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18, Apple has added a control in the Camera app's Settings menu that lets you choose whether audio playing on your iPhone should pause or continue when you start recording in Video mode.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960959" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/allow-audio-playback-camera-setting.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
In previous versions of iOS, shooting in Video mode in the Camera app automatically pauses any playing audio including music and podcasts. This behavior is based on the assumption that you don't want any sound coming out of your iPhone's speakers to be picked up on the video recording, but it's no good if you want to play a soundtrack to accompany whatever you're shooting.
<br/>
<br/>
One way to get around this is to use the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-quicktake-iphone-11/">QuickTake method of recording video</a> in Photo mode, introduced in iOS 13, which allows any audio playback to continue duri [...]<br>

            Aqara today introduced <a href="https://www.aqara.com/us/product/presence-sensor-fp1e/">a new Presence Sensor</a> that is designed to keep smart home products like lights turned on when someone is in the room.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Flight tracking app <a href="https://www.flightyapp.com">Flighty</a> was today updated with a new feature that is designed to provide users with additional information on the reason behind delayed flights.

<br/>
Flighty is using aviation authority data and machine learning to provide early warnings of delays, and when a delay is official, the reason for the delay. Most delays are due to airspace issues and late aircraft, both of which Flighty will monitor.
<br/>
<br/>
The app is able to predict delays "hours in advance," and give information to Flighty users that airlines often decline to share. The result is more control over travel plans.<blockquote>For example, the airline might delay your flight by 30 minutes ... and then another hour. But with these updates, Flighty 4 can tell you that's likely to be at least a five-hour d</blockquote> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is preparing to release a minor iOS 17.6.1 update for the iPhone, according to a post shared today by an anonymous leaker on X, formerly known as Twitter. The leaker has a private account, so we are not identifying it or linking to it, but they have proven to be a consistently accurate source for upcoming iOS updates.

<em>MacRumors</em> can independently confirm that Apple is internally testing an iOS 17.6.1 update, which is present in our analytics logs.

Nothing is known about iOS 17.6.1, beyond the leaker claiming that the update will have a build number of 21G93. However, the update will almost certainly be a minor one, especially given that Apple is focused on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/ios-18-beta-5-features/">iOS 18</a> and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/20 [...]<br>
