            Starting with tvOS 26.2, Apple TVs began displaying a user profile selection screen every time you wake the device from sleep.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple in macOS Tahoe 26.2 introduced Edge Light, a clever new feature that turns your Mac's display into a virtual ring light during video calls. Instead of fumbling with external lighting equipment, your Mac can now illuminate your face automatically when you're sitting in a dark room.

<br/>
Basically, Edge Light adds a soft glow around the edges of your display to brighten your face during video conferences. But it's far from just a simple screen border effect. Edge Light uses your Mac's Neural Engine to analyze your face, size, and position in the frame to deliver accurate lighting, while the Image Signal Processor fine-tunes brightness to match your environment.

The feature is even aware enough to know when your cursor approaches the display edge. When it does, Edge Light automatically recedes, a [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's highly anticipated foldable iPhone could face supply shortages into 2027 despite a planned launch next year, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

Kuo said in a <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/iL4L5hcO7csXvK">new research note</a>:
<br/>
<blockquote>"Development of the foldable iPhone is behind earlier expectations, but the product is still expected to [sic] announce in 2H26. Due to early-stage yield and ramp-up challenges, smooth shipments may not occur until 2027. With limited supply and expected strong demand, the foldable iPhone could be facing shortages until at least the end of 2026."</blockquote>The warning suggests Apple's ambitious foldable device will face manufacturing hurdles when it enters mass production. Foxconn was expected to begin limited production of the device  [...]<br>
