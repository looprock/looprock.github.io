<br/>
Instead of the familiar split between standard and Pro models, Apple this year introduced the new ‌iPhone Air‌ and expanded the feature gap between tiers. The result is a predicament between the affordable and practical ‌iPhone 17‌, and the super-thin and all-new ‌iPhone Air‌, with distinct trade-offs in size, materials, camera hardware, and battery life along the way. While they both share brighter displays, ProMotion, and an all-new 18-megapixel camera, their designs, display sizes, and camera features are more specialized than ever before.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, Apple has added a new feature to its Home screen customization options that can match the color of your app icons with the actual color of your iPhone. The image below demonstrates the effect on the new iPhone 17 Pro in Cosmic Orange.

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020253" height="3212" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/tinted-app-icons-match-iphone-17-cosmic-orange.jpg" width="5711"/>
<br/>
In iOS 18, Apple introduced Tinted app icons. The option applies a color filter over app icons, widgets, and even system UI elements, and with iOS 26, Apple has built on the theme with a new option that matches the color of your iPhone model. 
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26 knows the exact finish and color variant of your iPhone – Deep Blue, Sage, or Lavender, for example – because Apple has the device's SKU mapped at the firmware level (SKUs are a unique identifier that companies use to track and manage inventory). This allows iOS to identify your model and matc [...]<br>

            Everything is changing. Adam is joined by his good friend Beyang Liu from Sourcegraph — this time, talking about Amp (ampcode.com). Amp is one of the many, and one of Adam's favorite agentic coding tools to use. What makes it different is how they've engineered to it to maximize what’s possible with today’s frontier models. Autonomous reasoning, access to the oracle, comprehensive code editing, and complex task execution. That's nearly verbatim from their homepage, but it's also exactly what Adam has experienced. They talk through all things agents, how Adam might have been holding Amp wrong, and they even talked through Adam's idea called "Agent Flow". If you're babysitting agents, this episode is for you.<br>
