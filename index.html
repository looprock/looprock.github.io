            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Over the last couple of years, we've made massive progress towards building the necessary tooling to run Wasm in cloud native applications. The community learned a great deal from these early experiences, and this influenced us to create a new standard which we now call the Component Model. The Component Model is at a lower-level than WASI, it works well with WASI but is not dependent upon WASI. This is the result of us envisioning a software ecosystem that is not just based around a portable unit of compute, but something entirely new with composable, interoperable, and platform virtualizable WebAssembly modules.<br>

            Not far from Avignon, on the right bank of the Rhône opposite the mouth of the Durance, is one of my favourite points for the observations about to be recorded. It is the Bois des Issarts. Let no one deceive himself as to the value of the word “bois”—wood, which usually gives the idea of a soil carpeted with fresh moss and the shade of lofty trees, through whose foliage filters a subdued light. Scorching plains, where the cicada grinds out its song under pale olives, know nothing of such delicious retreats full of shade and coolness.
The Bois des Issarts is composed of thin and scattered groups of ilex, which hardly lessen the force of the sun’s rays. When I established myself during the dog days in July and August, I used to settle myself at some spot in the wood favourable for observations. I took refuge under a great umbrella, which later lent me most unexpected aid of another kind, very valuable too, as my story will show in good time.
