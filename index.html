            Carol Lee (Clinical Scientist) shares her research on code review anxiety. We dive deep into her recent research paper “Understanding and Effectively Mitigating Code Review Anxiety”. We get into all the nooks and crannies of this topic — common code review myths, strategies for coping, the need for awareness and self-reflection, the value of exposure and practice to build confidence, the importance of team dynamics, respect, empathy, and connection, and more. This show is jam-packed with goodies for everyone…and we even give a nod to the work we did on our podcast Brain Science.<br>

<br/>
When Apple Watch Ultra 2 debuted last year, key new features included a 50% brighter display, a faster S9 chip, a "Double Tap" gesture for interacting with the watch without touching the screen, on-device Siri, and increased internal storage. Unfortunately, the next version of the device is unlikely to reach those lofty heights. Here's what the rumors say.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-07-02 04:24:17-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When Apple released macOS Monterey in 2021, some key features required a Mac with Apple silicon. The same scenario played out with macOS Ventura in 2022, and then again the following year with the release of macOS Sonoma. With macOS Sequoia set to arrive in the fall, which new features can Intel Mac owners expect to be unavailable to them this time around?
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954631" height="1102" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-hero-240610.jpg" width="1960"/>
<br/>
Apple says that macOS Sequoia is compatible with the same Macs as macOS Sonoma other than the 2018 and 2019 MacBook Air, but Apple's fine print reveals that certain new features won't work on Intel machines that are otherwise compatible with macOS Sequoia. If you're still on an Intel Mac, here's what you won't have access to.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is said to have upped its order of next-generation chips from TSMC to between 90 million and 100 million units, following heightened demand expectations for its iPhone 16 series. 
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Last year's initial chip order volume for the iPhone 15 series launch is believed to have been in the region of 80-90 million units, suggesting Apple is anticipating higher demand for its 2024 devices in the region of 10 million units, according to Taiwanese outlet <em><a href="https://www.ctee.com.tw/news/20240701700050-430501">CTEE</a></em>. 
<br/>
<br/>
The arrival of Apple Intelligence in iOS 18 is expected to boost initial sales of the devices. One of the reasons is that Apple Intelligence requires at least an iPhone 15 Pro to run, which means owners of last year's iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will miss out on Apple's new [...]<br>
