            Meta this week unveiled $800 smart glasses that include an in-lens display. The new <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/meta-ray-ban-display-ai-glasses-connect-2025/">Meta Ray-Ban Display</a> AI glasses allow you to check messages, view photos, and interact with Meta AI without the need to use a smartphone.

<br/>
There is a full-color, high-resolution display included in the glasses, along with cameras, microphones, and speakers. Meta says that the included monocular display has a custom light engine and custom module that provides sharp contrast and high brightness. There are 42 pixels in each degree of the field of view.
<br/>
<br/>
Meta placed the display off to the side to prevent it from obstructing the view through the glasses, and the display is also not designed to be on constantly. It is meant for short interactions.

<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The battery inside the accessory has an unusual shape, leading iFixit to conclude that it's possible that Apple is using the same battery for the ‌iPhone Air‌ and the ‌iPhone Air‌ ‌MagSafe‌ Battery.
<br/>
<br/>
iFixit compared the battery in the ‌MagSafe‌ Battery pack to the ‌iPhone Air‌ battery that Apple showed off when introducing the new device, and it does appear to be a close match if not identical.

<br/>
The battery has a 12.26Wh capacity, and it is 2.72mm thick, which means it is thin enough to fit inside the 5.6mm ‌iPhone Air‌.

Available in version 25.25.74 of WhatsApp, the feature allows you to long press on any message in a conversation thread and select a new "Remind me" option in the popup menu.

Amp is one of the many, and one of Adam's favorite agentic coding tools to use. What makes it different is how they've engineered to it to maximize what’s possible with today’s frontier models. Autonomous reasoning, access to the oracle, comprehensive code editing, and complex task execution. That's nearly verbatim from their homepage, but it's also exactly what Adam has experienced. They talk through all things agents, how Adam might have been holding Amp wrong, and they even talked through Adam's idea called "Agent Flow".

No one really knows what will work and what they’re doing yet. As we learned in the digital transformation craze of the 2010’s, this means failure == learning. And learning is what you need to do a lot of.</p>
<p>More so, this kind of rapid learning, innovation, and sense making is exactly what a platform like Tanzu Platform with Cloud Foundry is excels at, and has a long, proven history of supporting.</p>
<p>You focus on learning new business models, features for your apps, and what works by writing and deploying code instead of building containers and configuring infrastructure.</p>
<p>And, as I like to say, if your organization writes a lot of their own code, there’s a good chance you already have the Tanzu Platform in place, ready to use. Just ask around.</p>

<p>There’s a creeping notion that Claude Code (and OpenAI Codex, I guess) are very useful for things that are not code. In the Obsidian community, where you keep your decades of notes as plain text, markdown files, some people are using Claude Code to do analysis, reformatting, etc. of their notes. I can see that you could do the same thing with the pile of Dungeons &amp; Dragons stuff I have laying around.</p>
<p>This makes sense, really. Source code is just plain text as well.</p>
