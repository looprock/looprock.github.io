            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Just ahead of Apple unveiling the iPhone 17 series <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/watch-iphone-17-apple-event-sep-9/">on Tuesday</a>, it appears that battery capacities for the devices have surfaced in a Chinese regulatory database.

<br/>
The table below lists the alleged battery capacities for each model, which were shared in a post on X today <a href="https://x.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1964884846100254931">by an account known as ShrimpApplePro</a>. 
<br/>
<br/>
The database suggests that the iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will be available with and without a physical SIM card slot, depending on the country of sale. For the base model iPhone 17, however, it appears that only one battery capacity for that device has been discovered in the database so far.

            In July 2024, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said he expected Samsung to begin shipping 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera sensors to Apple for iPhones <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/2026-iphone-48mp-camera-sensor-samsung/">as early as 2026</a>, which is when some iPhone 18 models are expected to be released.

<br/>
In a <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1964534143850860987">follow-up post</a> this weekend, however, Kuo said he now expects the first iPhone models with Samsung's sensor to be released in 2027. In other words, this rumor seemingly now applies to some iPhone 19 models, instead of iPhone 18 models.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, Apple's Spatial Scenes feature can transform ordinary photos into dynamic, three-dimensional pictures that respond to your movements. By adding depth and subtle motion to flat images, this clever AI-powered feature can bring to life photos in your iPhone's library – and your iPhone doesn't need Apple Intelligence to make use of it.

Spatial Scenes works by intelligently separating subjects from backgrounds in your photos. When you move your iPhone, the foreground elements stay relatively stable while background elements shift slightly. This creates a parallax effect that mimics how your eyes naturally perceive depth.

<br/>
The feature works using generative AI that analyzes your photos to identify different elements and create depth maps. Importantly, it doe [...]<br>

            <p>Every day, shoppers from Etsy's community of nearly 90M buyers visit our marketplace to search for unique, handmade, and vintage items. But with over 100 million listings, how do we help each buyer find exactly what they're looking for? Traditional search and recommendation systems often fall short of capturing the nuanced interests that make each Etsy buyer unique, from specific styles to aesthetic preferences. At Etsy, understanding our buyers' interests is central to delivering engaging, personalized experiences. </p>
<p>Recently, we explored enhancing our personalization by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to create detailed buyer profiles based on buyers’ browsing and purchasing behaviors. We build these profiles in alignment with privacy laws and requirements such as the GDPR and the CCPA/CPRA. Buyers have the ability to opt-out, so that they can choose not to have a profile generated at all.</p>
