            Google today announced the launch of its next-generation Pixel 10 smartphones, including the <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold/">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, the Pixel 10 Pro XL, the Pixel 10 Pro, and <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-xl/">the Pixel 10</a>.

<br/>
All of the new smartphones are equipped with the latest <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/tensor-g5-pixel-10/">Tensor G5 Chip</a>. Google's Tensor chips are the equivalent of Apple's A-series chips, and are designed in-house by Google. The G5 is built using 3-nanometer technology, and Google claims that it "unlocks the most advanced on-device AI on any phone." Gemini Nano runs 2.6x faster and it is 2x more efficient than the prior chip, plus CPU performance is up 34 percent.

Two years ago, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-finewoven/">stopped selling leather iPhone cases</a>, as part of the company's efforts to reduce its carbon emissions. As an alternative, Apple introduced a new "FineWoven" line of fabric iPhone cases made from 68% post-consumer recycled content, but they were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apples-finewoven-iphone-cases-poor-reviews/">prone to scratches and stains</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-discontinues-finewoven-cases/">ultimately discontinued</a>.

Parkinson's disease can cause hand tremors, which could ordinarily result in a hand-held video recording appearing shaky, but the Camera app's Action mode automatically stabilizes video recordings so that footage appears smooth.

"The simple act of filming can be challenging for people with Parkinson's," says Apple.
