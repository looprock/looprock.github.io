            <b>Published:</b> 2025-05-19 16:25:23-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today stopped signing iOS 18.4.1, a week after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/apple-releases-ios-18-5/">releasing the iOS 18.5 update</a>. Because iOS 18.4.1 is no longer being signed, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users who upgraded to iOS 18.5 are no longer able to downgrade to the previous version of iOS.

<br/>
"Signing" is a server-side verification check that Apple does when iOS is downloaded onto an ‌iPhone‌. An update can't be downloaded and installed unless it passes the verification check, and the unsigning process prevents customers from installing outdated versions of iOS that are not as secure.

Apple typically stops signing older software about a week after releasing an update, and doing so ensures that customers have the latest secu [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Twenty-four years ago today, Apple embarked on what many industry experts considered a risky venture that would ultimately transform not just the company's fortunes, but retail itself. On May 19, 2001, Apple opened its first retail store at Tysons Corner Center in Virginia, with Steve Jobs personally showing the press around the revolutionary space.

Some 500 eager visitors lined up before dawn to experience the store's hardwood floors, bright lighting, and clean lines. The aesthetic drew comparisons to trendy clothing retailer Gap. Not surprising, given that Gap CEO Mickey Drexler had been on Apple's board for two years at that point.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Epic Games on Friday filed a court motion asking District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers to order Apple to approve Fortnite for the US App Store, in another escalation of the ongoing legal battle between the two companies.

<br/>
In the filing, Epic claims Apple is in contempt of the judge's April order that restricted Apple from rejecting apps over their use of outside payment links. Epic argues that Apple's refusal to review its Fortnite submission until after a pending Ninth Circuit ruling amounts to retaliation for its legal challenges.

According to a letter from Apple <a href="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/05-15-25-letter-from-apple-14bad27bb985.pdf">shared by Epic</a>, Apple stated it "won't take action on the Fortnite app submission until after the Ninth Circuit rules on our pending request for a partial st [...]<br>
