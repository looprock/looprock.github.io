            In case you missed it — this is the post for people who mainly only read headlines — Apple has announced that it will be releasing iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1 later today. Apple shared this information in a press release on its Newsroom website.

            Apple is working on a refreshed version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a>, and it will have an updated processor that's based on the S-series chips inside the Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Series 10, and the upcoming Apple Watch Series 11.

<br/>
A reference to a ‌HomePod mini‌ equipped with a chip that uses T8310 microarchitecture was discovered in Apple code by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris. The device has a B525 codename, which likely corresponds to the next-generation ‌HomePod mini‌, since the current model's codename is B520.
<br/>
<br/>
The existing S9 and S10 chips in the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Series 10 have T8310 cores, and we're expecting the S11 in the Apple Watch Series 11 to use the same technology.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Rumors suggest that Apple is working on an updated version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> that's slated for launch later this year. Information about the upcoming device that was found in Apple code indicates that it will be equipped with the A17 Pro chip.

<br/>
There have been multiple rumors about a new ‌Apple TV‌ coming in 2025 with a new A-series processor, but it hasn't been clear which chip Apple would use until now. 
<br/>
<br/>
The A17 Pro was designed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Pro models, but Apple still makes it for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-mini-7/">iPad mini 7</a>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is still working on a next-generation version of the Studio Display, and <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris discovered signs of the new display in Apple code.

<br/>
The upcoming Studio Display 2 has a codename of J427, and references to J427 were tucked away in software code that Apple didn't mean to publish. Rumors suggest that the next-generation Studio Display will come out in early 2026, so it makes sense that Apple is testing it now.
<br/>
<br/>
We don't know a lot about the next-generation Apple display, but it is possible it will use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-mini-led-studio-display/">mini-LED backlighting</a>.
