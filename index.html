<br/>

With the update, Apple overhauled how Spotlight works, enabling new functionality that allows it to be used to complete all kinds of actions like sending emails without having to open up an app. There are also changes to a number of apps, including Messages, Safari, and Notes.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            A hit-or-miss leaker known as "Majin Bu" has doubled down on the possibility of Apple releasing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/06/iphone-17-liquid-silicone-cases-rumor/">so-called "Liquid Silicone" cases</a> for the iPhone 17 series.

<br/>
The leaker today <a href="https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1957434864375878052">shared a brief video on X</a> that shows a silicone case for what appears to be a standard iPhone 17 dummy model, based on the two rear cameras. Notably, the case has a pair of tiny holes in the bottom-left and bottom-right corners for attaching a lanyard, which would likely be sold separately by third-party brands. With a lanyard, you could keep your iPhone secured to your wrist while taking photos and more.
