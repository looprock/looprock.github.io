            Apple's motion to stay an Apple Watch sales ban for the duration of its appeal was denied today by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, according to a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/699619677/Federal-Circuit-Denies-Apple-Motion-to-Stay">court document</a> viewed by <em>MacRumors</em>.

Apple's AirPods firmware updates often do not come with details on new features, so it is unclear what might be included in the software.

Apple also does not offer instructions on how to upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ââAirPodsââ are connected to an iOS device. Putting the âââââAirPodsâââââ in the case, connecting the âââââAirPodsâââââ to a power source, and then pairing the âââââAirPodsâââââ to an iOS device or Mac should force the update.
