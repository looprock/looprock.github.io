Starting with iOS 18.1 later this year, developers will be able to offer in-app contactless transactions, separate from ‌Apple Pay‌ and Apple Wallet, using new APIs.

Apple's built-in apps have both Light and Dark color options in ‌iOS 18‌, and third-party apps will likely provide their own Light and Dark icon alternatives to match your preferred aesthetic when ‌iOS 18‌ is released to the public, but until then your ‌iPhone‌ will happily generate dark versions of them, too.

Apple calls the button the Capture Button internally, and it is going to be one of the most advanced buttons that's been introduced to date with support for multiple gestures and the ability to respond to pressure. Here's everything the button will be able to do, according to rumors:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>Lightly press on the button to autofocus while capturing an image or video.</li>

            When introducing the new Pixel 9 models today, Google didn't miss an opportunity to denigrate Apple Intelligence. All of the new Pixel 9 devices are integrated with Google's AI technology, Gemini, and there are a host of new AI features that Google introduced.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Like Apple Intelligence, Gemini works using on-device processing power, but Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-pixel-9-new-ai-features/#pixel9phones">made sure to point out</a> that Gemini is capable enough to answer complex queries without handing a task off to another AI service. The comment was a dig at Apple's plan to add ChatGPT integration to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, as ChatGPT will be able to do things that ‌Siri‌ can't. From Google:
<br/>
<blockquote>Gemini is deeply integrated with Google apps and Android and can handle complex queries without hand-off to third-party AI providers you may not know or trust.</blockquote>

            Next year's iPhone SE 4 will almost certainly come with 8GB of RAM, up from 4GB in the 2022 model, due to the hardware requirements of Apple Intelligence.

Currently in Apple's smartphone lineup, only the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/does-my-iphone-support-apple-intelligence/">iPhone 15 Pro models support Apple Intelligence</a>, Apple's suite of AI features coming in iOS 18.1, because the features require a minimum of 8GB of RAM. There is only 6GB RAM in the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, so they will miss out.

Following the release of the iPhone 16 lineup in September, Apple will release the fourth-generation iPhone SE as early as the beginning of 2025, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-11/iphone-16-preview-bigger-screens-new-colors-camera-button-ai-and- [...]<br>

<br/>
One of the reasons Apple limited region access to Apple Intelligence was that it only supports US English. Another reason Apple Intelligence was previously not available in the EU was because Apple geo-locked access within the bloc, likely due to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/21/apple-intelligence-europe-delay/">regulatory issues</a> related to the Digital Markets Act.

Group chats allow users aged 16 and over to share and comment on TikTok videos with friends and family members without having to open a separate messaging app like WhatsApp or Messenger.

Starting a group chat can be done in a couple of ways. Users can tap a Chat button at the top of the TikTok inbox and select the names of people they want to include, or they can tap Start Group Chat when sharing a post with several people.
