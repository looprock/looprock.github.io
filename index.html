            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-22 15:48:08-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has stopped signing iOS 18.6.2, which means that if you've upgraded to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, you're no longer able to downgrade to a version of iOS 18. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/15/apple-releases-ios-26/">released iOS 26</a> a week ago.

<br/>
When software is "signed," it means that it has passed a server-side verification check that Apple performs when a new version of iOS is downloaded on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. An update can't be installed unless it passes the verification check.
<br/>

Unsigning software prevents Apple customers from installing outdated, less secure versions of iOS.

Apple isn't forcing users to install ‌iOS 26‌, and there is an option to continue using iOS 18,  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, Live Translation enables hands-free communication by allowing users who don't share the same language to speak naturally while wearing AirPods. For conversations with non-AirPods users, the iPhone can display live transcriptions horizontally, showing translations in the other person's preferred language. Keep reading to learn how to use it.

            Happy <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> day! The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> and the other new ‌iPhone 17‌ models are now available in stores and in the hands of customers. We picked up the ‌iPhone Air‌, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, and ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max for a first impressions video.
