            This week on The Changelog Adam is joined by Zach Lloyd, Founder & CEO of Warp. We talked with Zach last year about what it takes to build the terminal of the future, and today Adam catches up with Zach to see where they are at on that mission. They talk about the business model of Warp, how they measure success, reaching product/market fit, building features developers love, integrating AI, and the pros and cons of going open source (again).<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-08-30 02:51:59-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Google <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> users on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> can now lock their most sensitive images and videos in a special passcode-protected folder, thanks to a new feature rolling out to the iOS app.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-885298" height="787" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/google-photos-app.jpg" width="1400"/>
<br/>
Previously only available on Android phones, the privacy-oriented Locked Folder feature allows users to save photos and videos in the app within a separate space that requires <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>, or a passcode to access.
<br/>
<br/>
Media saved in the folder remains hidden, meaning the sensitive photos don't show up as users scroll through their Google ‌Photos‌ or any other apps on their device.
