            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple appears to be internally testing an iOS 17.2.1 update for the iPhone, based on evidence of the software in our website's analytics logs this week.

<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.2.1 would likely be a minor update with fixes for bugs and/or security vulnerabilities. Following the release of iOS 17.2 last week, some users have complained about a bug that <a href="https://twitter.com/akhimohammed1/status/1736641886746562922">causes the Messages app to</a> [...]<br>

Demoing PCs with the new chipset, the San Diego manufacturer told <em><a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/qualcomm-is-ready-to-compete-with-m3-series-in-2024/">Digital Trends</a></em> that the Snapdragon X Elite records a multi-core Geekbench score of 15,300, whereas Apple's M3 obtains a score of 12,154. What Qualcomm did not mention however is the Snapdragon-powered machine's power consumption as a benchmarking vector, which is an important indicator of efficiency performance.

            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> could feature an upgraded Ultra Wide camera with a 48-megapixel sensor, according to a Weibo leaker.

<br/>
The rumor comes from Weibo user "<a href="https://weibo.com/u/5143897135">Instant Digital</a>" and suggests that 2024's ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ models will be the first to feature more than one 48-megapixel sensor, leaving the Telephoto camera as the only rear-facing lens with a 12-megapixel resolution. The Ultra Wide camera's upgrade to a 48-megapixel sensor should allow it to capture more light, resulting in enhanced photos when shooting in 0.5× mode, especially in low-light environments.

            Apple has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=6e9odqgu">announced</a> an App Store pilot program called "contingent pricing" that lets app developers offer discounts to customers with multiple subscriptions.

<br/>
Developers can offer contingent pricing to customers who already have subscriptions "from one developer or two different developers." For example, a developer could attract customers to a subscription by offering discounted pricing if they have an active subscription with another developer.

<blockquote>Contingent pricing for subscriptions on the App Store — a new feature that helps you attract and retain subscribers — lets you give customers a discounted subscription price as long as they're actively subscribed to a different subscription.</blockquote>As noted by <em>&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/1</em> [...]<br>
