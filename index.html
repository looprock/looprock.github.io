            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Jean Yang’s research on programming languages at Carnegie Mellon led her to realize that APIs are the layer that makes or breaks quality software systems. Unfortunately, developers are underserved by tools for dealing with, securing & understanding APIs. That realization led her to found Akita Software, which led her to join Postman by way of acquisition. That move, at least in part, also led her to join us on this very podcast.

<br/>
This limitation has existed since the first Apple silicon Macs with the M1 chip were released in 2020, but users can connect multiple external displays to M1, M2, and M3 Macs with DisplayLink adapters as an unofficial workaround. One exception is the Mac mini, which will likely be updated with the M3 chip next year and should retain support for up to two external displays, given that it lacks a built-in display.

<br/>
The 2021 ‌iMac‌ was the first of its kind to feature an Apple silicon chip, replacing previous Intel-based models with 21.5- and 27-inch displays. It offered an all-new ultra-thin design, a 24-inch Retina display, a six-speaker system with force-cancelling woofers, and an array of seven two-tone color options. The 2021 ‌iMac‌ has now been discontinued by Apple and prices at third-party resellers are falling. As such, some customers may be weighing up whether to upgrade to a 2021 or 2023 ‌iMac‌.

The 14-inch MacBook Pro has a larger display than the 13-inch model for more screen real estate, and it features much more modern-looking thin bezels. There's also a notch that houses the front-facing camera, a necessity for those slimmed down bezels. It is a mini-LED Liquid Retina XDR display, which is an upgrade over the LCD of the prior-generation 13-inch model.

<br/>
The Macs will ship with a custom version of ‌macOS Sonoma‌ 14.1 with a build number of 23B2073, but new users will need to download and install a new version with a build number of 23B2077.
<br/>
<br/>
Day one updates are not unusual for new devices as Apple often has to begin manufacturing with an older version of the software. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-releases-macos-sonoma-14-1/">first released macOS Sonoma 14.1</a> on Wednesday, October 25, and the current version has a build number of 23B74.

<li>Data sets which are so large that they cannot be efficiently processed by a single server
  </li><li>Write-heavy workloads that cannot be efficiently written by a single server
</li></ul>
<p>Postgres is a great general-purpose database, and it might be fine if Postgres were deemed unacceptable for such workloads, especially if supporting such workloads required a major redesign of Postgres. 
However, could Postgres be modified incrementally to support such workloads?  This is what the Postgres development community has been working on since
