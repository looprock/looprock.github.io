Tulsi Gabbard said in a <a href="https://x.com/DNIGabbard/status/1957623737232007638">post on X (Twitter)</a> the UK had dropped its plans to force Apple to provide a back door that would have "enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties."
