            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            This week we’re going deep on security and what it takes to shift left, seriously. Adam is joined by Justin Garrison (co-host of Ship It), plus two members of the BoxyHQ team — Deepak Prabhakara, Co-founder & CEO and Schalk Neethling, Community Manager and DevRel as well as fellow Changelog Slack member. We discuss how to shift left, the role of the developer and the burden of security, the importance of tooling, the difference between authentication and authorization, and a mindset change for when security takes place — it’s a matter of “when” not “who.”<br>

            Apple this week <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">updated its website</a> to confirm that the first U.S. vehicle models with next-generation CarPlay support will debut in 2024, but it did not provide a more specific timeframe, or indicate when availability will begin in other countries.

In this article, we've rounded up everything new in iOS 17.4 beta 1. 
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>EU Changes</h2>
<br/>
Apple implemented several major changes to the way the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> and apps operate in the European Union in order to comply with the Digital Markets Act.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            App developers in the European Union who choose to opt in to Apple's new business terms must pay an €0.50 "<a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/core-technology-fee/">Core Technology Fee</a>" or CTF for every app install over one million installs, a model that has the potential to bankrupt free or freemium app developers.

<br/>
Apple does not charge for the first one million "first annual installs" per iOS account each year, but after that, developers will begin racking up charges. A free or freemium app that goes "viral" and is downloaded more than one million times could be forced to pay astronomical fees, as <a href="https://mastodon.social/@stroughtonsmith/111818345294643786">demonstrated in estimates</a> shared by developer Steve Troughton-Smith.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apps that are distributed through alternative app stores in EU countries will need to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu#ios-app-eu">submit to a notarization process</a> that's similar to the notarization process for Mac apps. According to Apple, Notarization applies to all apps, and it is a process focused on privacy, security, and maintaining device integrity.

<br/>
Apple is aiming to ensure that apps do not have viruses, malware, or other security threats, and that they function as promised without exposing users to "egregious fraud."
<br/>
<br/>
Notarization will check for the following:

<ul>
<br/>

<br/>
The ‌Epic Games‌ Store will include popular game Fortnite, which means ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ users will be able to install and play the title without having to use a cloud gaming service. Fortnite has been banned from the iOS <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> for the last several years due to the legal dispute between Apple and ‌Epic Games‌.

With the 10th-generation ‌iPad‌, Apple relocated the front-facing camera to the side of the device so that it would be usable in landscape mode rather than portrait mode, and it appears that Apple is making this change with future iPads as well.
