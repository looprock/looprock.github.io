            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple plans to release its delayed Apple Intelligence Siri features in the fall, according to a new report by <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/technology/apple-issues-trump-tariffs.html">The New York Times</a></em>.

<br/>
In early March, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">said</a> that it was going to take longer than expected to roll out the more personalized ‌Siri‌ experience, and that these features would be rolled out "in the coming year." Subsequently, <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-says-some-ai-improvements-siri-delayed-2026-2025-03-07/">Reuters</a></em> reported that the ‌Apple Intelligence‌ ‌Siri‌ features have been delayed until 2026.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-04-11 04:33:34-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's current struggles with Apple Intelligence and Siri began in early 2023 when AI head John Giannandrea sought approval from CEO Tim Cook to purchase more AI chips for development, according to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/technology/apple-issues-trump-tariffs.html">The New York Times</a></em>.

<br/>
Cook initially approved doubling the team's chip budget, but CFO Luca Maestri reportedly reduced the increase to less than half that amount, and instead encouraged the team to make existing chips more efficient.
<br/>
<br/>
The lack of adequate GPU resources meant Apple's AI team had to negotiate for computing power from providers like Google and Amazon.

At the time, Apple's data centers had about 50,000 GPUs that were more than five years old – far fewer than the hund [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            On a Mac that has a top row of function keys, Apple includes volume and brightness controls that can be used to make adjustments in stepwise increments. However, there may be times when you want to make more fine grained adjustments to these settings than the default increments allow – in which case, read on.

<br/>
Whenever you tap the volume or brightness controls on your keyboard, you'll see an indicator appear on your Mac's screen with 16 fixed increments separated by lines. With the help of a keyboard modifier, it's actually possible to make more nuanced quarter-step changes to sound volume and screen brightness using a total of 64 increments.
