            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> received a major update today, with Apple introducing a slimmed down design that shaves more than two inches off of the size so it takes up less space on a desktop or in a rack. Despite the size change, the ‌Mac mini‌ uses Apple's most powerful M-series chips, including the new M4 Pro.

<br/>
Combining the smaller form factor and updated chips necessitated a redesigned thermal architecture. The foot of the ‌Mac mini‌ allows it to pull in air from the surrounding environment, and the air is able to circulate throughout before being vented back out through the bottom foot.

Apple says that air is guided to each level of the system, and that combined with the power efficiency of the M4 chips, the ‌Mac mini‌ can [...]<br>

            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-mini/">M4 Mac mini</a> has an overhauled design that adds more ports in a slimmed down package, and to make everything fit, Apple needed a new place for the power button.

            Apple dropped a surprise today with the announcement of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/apple-announces-redesigned-mac-mini/">new redesigned Mac mini</a> when it revealed that the M4 Pro model comes with three Thunderbolt 5 ports, making it the first Mac to support the next-generation connectivity standard.

<br/>
The newest specification of Thunderbolt offers 80 Gb/s of bi-directional bandwidth, and with Bandwidth Boost it will provide up to 120 Gb/s, enabling triple the maximum bandwidth of Thunderbolt 4 for an optimal display experience. 
<br/>
<br/>
Given that the current 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M3 Pro and M3 Max chips only support the older protocol, you can almost consider it a given that Apple's upcoming MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max will support Thunderbolt 5.

<br/>
The new ‌Mac mini‌ looks dramatically different to previous models thanks to a markedly smaller enclosure and two front USB-C ports, but it is also much more powerful thanks to the M4 and M4 Pro chips.
