            We're still counting down the days until the 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference, and Apple's big event is creeping closer.

<br/>
<h2>Naming</h2>
<br/>
Rather than naming the next-generation version watchOS 12, Apple is going to call it watchOS 26. All of the software updates coming this year will be numbered "26," reflecting the September 2025 to September 2026 release cycle.
<br/>
<br/>
watchOS 26 will launch alongside <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a>, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26, all of which are being renamed.
