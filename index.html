            <b>Published:</b> 2024-01-11 10:56:40-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is planning to produce between 60,000 and 80,000 Vision Pro units for the February 2 launch of the device, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1745516663867629912">analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. With the small size of the shipment, Kuo believes that the Vision Pro will "sell out soon after the release."

<br/>
According to Kuo, though Apple has not yet defined the key applications for the Vision Pro and the price is high, the "groundbreaking technology innovations" and Apple's "base of core fans and heavy users" will exhaust supplies of the device.

Kuo made similar comments <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/kuo-apple-vision-pro-may-sell-out-fast/">earlier this week</a> when he said that demand for the headset would cause it to sell out during pre-orders,  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>

Microsoft has briefly overtaken Apple as the most valuable company since 2018, most recently in 2020 and 2021 when concerns about supply chain shortages dented Apple's stock price and a boom in remote working bolstered Microsoft. Over the past year, Microsoft's support for artificial intelligence tools by backing OpenAI has helped boost its value, while equivalent offerings from Apple have been noticeably absent.

Despite Apple's announcement that Vision Pro will launch on February 2, Apple has yet to expand on the specifics of how the two devices work together. But sift through code and marketing materials, and there are subtle indications about what is possible - and what the limitations are likely to be. Here's what we know.

In a document filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, ITC lawyers said "Apple presents a weak and unconvincing case to invoke the extraordinary remedy of a stay pending appeal," adding that Apple's arguments "amount to little more than an indisputably adjudicated infringer requesting permission to continue infringing the asserted patents."

            Apple today seeded the third betas of upcoming iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 updates to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the software ahead of its release. The second public iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 betas come almost a month after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/14/apple-seeds-ios-17-3-public-beta-1/">released the first betas</a>. Note that while Apple is calling these the third betas of iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3, there was technically never a second public beta. Apple had to pull the second developer betas of iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3, and opted to go straight to the third beta rather than releasing an updated public beta version.

<br/>
Evidence that the feature was in development first appeared in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/28/google-maps-preparing-live-activities/">August</a>, but further work on it had appeared to have come to a standstill until now, suggesting it could become functional soon. 
<br/>
<br/>
The Google Maps team announced in February 2023 that it would roll out Live Activities support "in the coming months," so support is now long overdue based on the company's own internal roadmap.

When support rolls out, Google Maps users will be able to view turn-by-turn directions and their ETA in a  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>As of this writing, I know of three ways to make use of the incremental backup feature that I committed near the end of last month. I'll be interested to see how people deploy in practice. The first idea is to replace some of the full backups you're currently doing with incremental backups, saving backup time and network transfer. The second idea is to do just as many full backups as you do now, but add incremental backups between them, so that if you need to do PITR, you can use <span style="font-family: courier;">pg_combinebackup</span> to reach the latest incremental backup before the point to which you want to recover, reducing the amount of WAL that you need to replay, and probably speeding up the process quite a bit. The third idea is to give up on taking full backups altogether and only ever take incremental backups.</p><span></span><a href="https://rhaas.blogspot.com/2024/01/incremental-backups-evergreen-and-other.html#more">Read more »</a><br>
