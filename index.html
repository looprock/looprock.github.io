            A Texas federal district judge granted a preliminary injunction blocking the enforcement of a controversial age verification law set to enter force September 1.

Much of the app has been rebuilt from scratch to make the app more intuitive to use.

Aimed at photography enthusiasts, Obscura has a wide range of features, but it is also simple enough that it can be used casually. The updated design puts the camera controls that you need most front and center so they're easily accessible, with additional tools packed into radial menus.

As we have learned in our previous blogs, the Dark Web constitutes a part of the Deep Web, where unindexed and non-searchable content lies hidden from traditional search engines. This obscured domain is accessible only through specialized software like Tor (The Onion Router), providing users with anonymity and privacy. However, the Dark Web’s anonymity has also made it a haven for illicit activities, making OSINT all the more crucial in understanding and combating cybercrime.</p>
