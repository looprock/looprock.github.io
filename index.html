            It's nearly the end of the road for the Apple Watch Series 4, which was added to Apple's public-facing <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102772">vintage products list</a> today.

<br/>
All aluminum and stainless steel 40mm and 44mm models of the Apple Watch Series 4 are now considered vintage worldwide. Apple considers a device to be vintage once five years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale. Apple and Apple Authorized Service Providers may offer repairs for vintage devices if parts remain available.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple Watch Series 4 models launched in 2018, ushering in a major new design with a thinner case and a 30% larger display than before.

With the year now coming to an end, this means that the device may no longer be in active production.

Citing multiple people "directly involved" in making components for the headset, the report said that the scaling back of production began in the early summer. This indicated that Apple now has a sufficient number of Vision Pro units i [...]<br>

<br/>
With the exception of Vision Pro, Apple's 2024 hardware releases largely marked a year of steady refinement. It wasn't a year of massive overhauls across the board, but it did feature some key themes. 
<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro, released in February, stands out as Apple's biggest product launch. While its $3,499 price tag keeps it squarely in early-adopter territory, Apple's first spatial computing device provides a hint at where the company expects technology to move over the coming years. Despite both excitement and criticism surrounding its capabilities, it's clear that 2024 was about laying the foundation, with its true impact likely to unfold in the years to come.
