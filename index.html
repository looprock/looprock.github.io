            <b>Summary:</b><br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In Safari on iPhone, it's not unusual for the number of tabs you have open to quickly get out of hand. Here's how to temporarily clean things up without losing your tabs.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1000087" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/safari-tabs-hand.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
If you have no use for all your open tabs, you can simply select one, then press and hold on the tabs button in the bottom-right corner of the screen. This will bring up an option to "Close All [x] Tabs," X being the number open. 
<br/>
<br/>
Using the close all tabs option is one solution for restoring order to your browser session, but that's no good if you're not finished looking at the open tabs, especially if you're busy researching a project or a vacation, let's say.
<br/>
<br/>
You could always bookmark the open web pages for later reference. But you don't have to bookmark each tab one by one – that could take a while depending on how many are o [...]<br>
