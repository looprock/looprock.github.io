            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the launch of the refreshed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models, Apple introduced a new "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> Pro." No ‌Apple Pencil‌ options have been discontinued, which means there are now four total Apple Pencils to choose from.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
While the updated ‌iPad Pro‌ and ‌iPad Air‌ are compatible with the ‌Apple Pencil‌ Pro and the USB-C ‌Apple Pencil‌, they do not work with the ‌Apple Pencil‌ 2. Older iPads are also not able to work with the ‌Apple Pencil‌ Pro.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple at its "Let Loose" event today <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-event-live-blog-may-2024/">announced</a> new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models, and there are smaller changes compared to the previous generation devices that did not get mentioned during the event but are worth knowing about.

<br/>
One of the differences worth noting is the lack of a physical SIM card slot. On the previous generation models, the cellular versions of both the ‌iPad Air‌ and the ‌iPad Pro‌ included a physical SIM card slot. In the new devices, that's no longer the case. All cellular models now support eSIM only.

At its core, this bill is still an unconstitutional censorship bill that restricts protected online speech and gives the government the power to target services and content [&#8230;]<br>

No, no - not at all. How much it cost to make a thing has little to do with what price the thing sells for. And there’s the arbitrage: a business model is all about making the difference between the cost of goods sold and the price paid for goods as big, large, and mysterious as possible.
