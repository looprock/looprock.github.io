Nowadays, many applications help us to edit our photos and images. With these applications, we can add some artistic effect or a filter that makes our image look with better color or maybe without color or look like an old photo, etc.</p>
<p>\
Apps such as Instagram offer editing options with many predefined filters and the option to create one by ourselves. This makes me wonder: “How do filters work on digital images? How are they created, or what do they do to the image?”.</p>
<p>\
I’m not going to address issues such as image processing with graphics or algorithms, but I would like to develop an application that allows us to add filters to an image.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>\
PID controllers were invented at the beginning of the 20th century. Nevertheless, their mathematical description was obtained much later. Today, this mechanism finds various applications in different industries, from autopilots to industrial automation. When working with PID controllers, one of the most challenging tasks is to tune them properly. In this paper, we analyze the mathematical representations of PID controller gains used to tune the algorithm.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Proportional–integral–derivative controllers</strong>, or PID controllers, find many applications. They are used in controllers for BLDC motors, flight controllers, and power factor correction units. You can find dozens of them in electric vehicles. PID controllers are a part of temperature and humidity control systems used in the manufacturing, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries. PID controllers are used in power electronics (particularly in converters), industrial furnaces, and almost all automated processes in manufacturing.</p> [...]<br>

            NAT (Network Address Translation) technology, vital for internet infrastructure, poses challenges for direct device-to-device connections. This article explores solutions, including NAT Punch-Through, TCP/UDP Hole Punching, ICMP Hole Punching, STUN, and Relay Fallback, for real-time multiplayer games. These techniques overcome NAT limitations, allowing efficient direct connections or using relay servers when needed. Understanding NAT's impact on game development is crucial for optimizing multiplayer experiences. Next article will cover data encoding and compression principles.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Opside's NCRC (Native Cross Rollup Communication) protocol offers a trustless solution for Rollup interoperability. The NCRC protocol doesn't involve adding an additional third-party bridge to each Rollup; Instead, it transforms the native bridge of ZK-Rollup at the system level, allowing direct utilization of the native bridges of different ZK-Rollups for cross-Rollup communication. This approach is more streamlined and comprehensive, inheriting the absolute security of native bridges while avoiding the system complexity and trust costs associated with third-party bridges.<br>
