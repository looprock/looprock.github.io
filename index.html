As of shortly after 6 a.m. Pacific Time today, nearly all iPhone 17 Pro Max configurations on Apple's online store in the U.S. are facing an additional 1-3 week shipping delay beyond the Friday, September 19 launch day. This means that some configurations are now expected to be delivered in mid-October.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's claim that the Apple Watch Series 11 offers 24 hours of battery life has drawn scrutiny as closer examination of Apple's own testing data reveals that the increase from the Series 10's 18-hour rating is largely attributable to changes in testing methodology rather than a major hardware change.

<br/>
Apple lists the Apple Watch Series 11 as capable of lasting up to 24 hours on a single charge, a notable increase over the Series 10's 18-hour claim, which had been the company's published standard since the launch of the original Apple Watch in 2015.
