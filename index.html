In a research note with investment bank Haitong International this week, Pu reiterated his previous claim that both the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will feature a 48-megapixel Telephoto rear camera and a 24-megapixel front camera.

He also expects the iPhone 17 Pro models to be equipped with 12GB of RAM, up from 8GB in iPhone 16 Pro models. This increase in memory would contribute to improved performance for Apple Intelligence and multitasking.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-10-18 06:58:12-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Just like iPhone 16 models, the new iPad mini is likely to launch without Apple Intelligence, but the features should be available on the device soon.

<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/ipad-mini-7-benchmarks-confirm-8gb-ram/">Geekbench results</a> for the iPad mini with the A17 Pro chip list the device as running iPadOS 18.0, instead of iPadOS 18.1 with Apple Intelligence.
<br/>
<br/>
Last month, a private account on social media platform X with a proven track record of sharing upcoming iOS versions mentioned a special build of iPadOS 18.0 for the iPad mini 7, and it appears that the device will indeed come preinstalled with iPadOS 18.0 out of the box when it begins arriving to customers on Wednesday, October 23.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            This week we're going back in time to one of our top performing shows of all time where we talk with Matt Rickard about his blog post Reflections on 10,000 Hours of Programming. These reflections are about deliberately writing code for 10,000 hours. Most don't apply to beginners. He was clear to mention that these reflections are purely about coding, not career advice or soft skills. If you count the reflections we cover on the show and be the first to comment the amount of reflections on this thread in Zulip, we'll give you a coupon code to use for a 100% free t-shirt from the merch store. Good luck...<br>

<p id="ZcGGw9">In 2024, you can go onto YouTube, one of the most popular media distributors in the United States and the world, and you can pull up Janet Jackson’s 2004 performance at the Super Bowl. There are videos with her whole 11-minute performance and others that show only the three seconds that shook the country. Justin Timberlake, standing to Jackson’s left and singing “better have you naked / by the end of this song” from his song “Rock Your Body,” reaches across her body, grabs her garment, and yanks. A “wardrobe malfunction” ensues, and instead of revealing a pretty red bra, you — for not even a full second — see her nearly bare breast, a star-sh</p> [...]<br>

<p id="Gv7Ld5">In 2004, I was an undiagnosed neurodivergent teenager who had given up on trying to fit in. It felt like <em>everyone</em> was trying to mold me into their version of perfect by chastising me when I did something “wrong.” It was confusing, exhausting, and demoralizing.
