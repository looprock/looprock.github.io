The DMA comes into full effect in March 2024. That leaves just a few weeks for WhatsApp and others to bring their services into compliance. However, <em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-interoperability-messaging/">Wired</a></em> reports that WhatsApp has actually  [...]<br>

The full ruling is under seal as of now due to confidentiality requests from Apple and AliveCor, but the filing makes it clear that the case went in Apple's favor and the Cupertino company was not found to have engaged in anticompetitive behavior.
