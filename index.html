            Chrome and Mozilla will stop trusting Entrust’s public TLS certificates issued after November 2024 due to concerns about Entrust’s compliance with security standards. In response, Entrust is partnering with SSL.com to continue providing trusted certificates.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's rumored in-house Wi-Fi chip might debut in devices as early as next year, according to Taiwanese industry publication <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240917PD201/apple-5g-2025-modem-chips.html"><em>DigiTimes</em></a>.

<br/>
The report cites insiders from Apple's supply chain who suggested that at least some new iPad models launching in 2025 might be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi chip, although they said there is a chance that the chip might not debut until the iPhone 18 series in 2026. Apple's plans to design its own Wi-Fi chip were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/16/apple-chip-team-irvine/">first reported in 2021</a>, so the project has seemingly been in development for quite some time now.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-09-19 04:10:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18, Apple has made a significant enhancement to the Notes app, introducing a built-in audio recording feature that streamlines the process of capturing and transcribing voice notes. The new functionality is available on iPhone 12 and later models, and allows you to record audio directly within a note, eliminating the need to use separate apps or share files.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962314" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-notes-app-voice-recording.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
The new audio recording tool in Notes offers more than just simple voice capture. As users record, the app automatically generates a real-time transcript, making it easier to review and search through recorded content. This feature is particularly useful for students attending lectures, professionals in meetings, or anyone who needs to quickly capture and reference spoken information.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The European Union today issued a warning to Apple, demanding that the tech giant open up its iOS operating system to rival companies and third-party developers or potentially face significant fines. The move is part of the EU's efforts to enforce the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to ensure fair competition in the digital marketplace.

The European Commission has initiated two specification proceedings to guide Apple towards compliance with its interoperability obligations under the DMA.

            Next year's iPhone 17 series will feature processors made using TSMC's enhanced N3P 3-nanometer chip technology, but only iPhone 18 Pro models in 2026 are likely to use the Taiwanese chipmaker's next-generation 2nm processor technology because of cost concerns, according to <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1836674446763208925">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.

<br/>
The terms "3nm" and "2nm" describe generations of chip manufacturing technology, each with its own set of design rules and architecture. As these numbers decrease, they generally indicate smaller transistor sizes. Smaller transistors allow more to be packed onto a single chip, typically resulting in increased processing speed and improved power efficiency.

The batteries use a type of adhesive that can be loosened with low-voltage electrical current, such as from a 9V battery, according to Apple. The battery can then be easily removed from the devices, with this new process considered to be easier than the adhesive pull tabs that are found under batteries in some previous iPhone models.

            Apple has introduced significant updates to its Messages app in iOS 18, with a particular focus on enhancing the popular Tapback feature. Tapbacks, the quick reactions users can add to messages by long-pressing on them, have received a colorful makeover and expanded functionality.
