            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> was introduced in March last year, adding the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip, Center Stage on the front-facing camera, a faster USB-C port, and several new color options, but it was still a fairly minor upgrade over the previous model from September 2020. As we near a year and a half since the fifth-generation ‌iPad Air‌ was introduced, what can users expect from the sixth-generation model and when will it launch?

As of 2023, it has been some time since the ‌iPad Air‌ had a major hardware refresh.

found two ways to improve the talk.  First, in researching my <a class="txt2html" href="https://momjian.us/main/presentations/performance.html#beyond" style="text-decoration: none;"><em>Beyond Joins and Indexes</em></a> talk, I was reminded (slide 65) of the
difference in NULL handling between NOT IN and NOT EXISTS.  I realized this information should be my nulls talk, so I added slide 25 to cover this.
</p>
<p>Second, someone asked during the Q&amp;A if I could summarize how to avoid problems with NULLs so I added slide 44 at the end.  Humorously my major recommendation was to liberally use NOT
NULL column constraints where appropriate to prevent their existence.  Fewer nulls, fewer prob</p> [...]<br>

            Award-winning iPhone camera app <a href="http://halide.cam/download">Halide</a> was today updated for iPhone 15 Pro models, and features a set of in-app triggers that work with the devices' new Action button.

<br/>
With the Halide 2.13 app open on an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max, the Action button can be pressed to trigger manual focus, auto/manual exposure, RAW capture, 12/48-megapixel capture, cycle through lenses, take a picture, and more.
<br/>
<br/>
To achieve the feat, Halide developers built a custom Shortcut that when selected in iOS Settings ➝ Action Button, automatically triggers a pre-set option in the app's dedicated new Action button menu when the app is active.
