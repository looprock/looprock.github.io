            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is introducing a new camera-based "Capture" button on at least some iPhone 16 models this year, and a new rumor claims that Apple's own silicone cases will have a design that is specially made so as not to impede the use of the capacitive button's multiple functions.

<br/>
Several rumors have suggested that the iPhone 16 models are going to have an all-new button that's designed to make it easier to capture photos when the devices are held in landscape mode. Apple plans to put the button on the right side of the ‌iPhone‌, in the space where the mmWave antenna is on iPhones that are sold in the United States.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            As Apple's iPhone 16 launch approaches, questions are swirling about a potential leap in storage capacity for the iPhone 16 Pro models. According to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/iphone-16-pro-2tb-option-rumor/">January report</a>, the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max will double their maximum storage to 2TB.

<br/>
This speculation stems from Apple's rumored adoption of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/1tb-iphone-16-pro-could-face-performance-setback/">Quad-Level Cell (QLC) NAND flash memory</a>. QLC technology could allow Apple to pack more storage into a smaller space while potentially reducing costs compared to the current Triple-Level Cell (TLC) NAND.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-09-03 19:08:44+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit concluded, in Anderson v. TikTok, that algorithmic recommendations aren’t protected by Section 230. Because they’re the platforms’ First Amendment-protected expression, the court reasoned, algorithms are the platforms’ “own first-party speech,” and thus fall outside Section 230’s liability shield for the publication of third-party speech.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            There are a number of ways that Apple, Google, Amazon, Meta, ByteDance, and Microsoft are failing to comply with the Digital Markets Act, according to <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/sites/default/files/publications/BEUC-X-2024-062_Summary-non-compliance-reports-gatekeepers.pdf">an analysis published</a> by the European Consumer Organization (BEUC). The BEUC advocates for consumer rights and provides guidance to European lawmakers.

<br/>
In regard to Apple, the BEUC outlines several ways that the company's DMA compliance efforts fall short, but it is worth noting that Apple has addressed many of these issues in its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/app-store-external-links-european-union/">most recent DMA updates</a>, which will be implemented starting later in 2024.
