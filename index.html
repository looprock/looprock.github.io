This also means that your interactions, inputs, and results may also be shared with our service provider xAI for these purposes. Learn more</blockquote>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's User Privacy Engineering Manager Katie Skinner and Privacy Product Marketing Lead Sandy Parakilas recently sat down with YouTuber Andru Edwards for a wide-ranging discussion on Apple's privacy policies.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Topics covered include Apple's approach to privacy, the ways Apple contends with privacy laws in different countries, and how Apple deals with government requests, plus there's a good deal of information on the new features in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Some of what's discussed covers privacy information that Apple has reiterated over and over again, but there are some interesting tidbits on Apple's adoption of ChatGPT, Maps privacy, the Passwords app, and accessory pairing in ‌iOS 18‌.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a long discussion at almost 45 minutes, but worth it for those who want a bit more insight into Apple's philosophy on privacy.<br/>This article, "&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.co [...]<br>

            <p>Like in many companies, you probably have some databases lying around that are starting to cost a lot in terms of storage. You are paying more and more every week; the more you wait, the more money will be spent for nothing. It’s time for a cleanup.</p><p>The basic approach is to write a script that will scan your DB and delete the items that aren’t useful anymore (e.g., really old data).</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong> that can be extremely expensive with Dynamo DB, so expensive that it will take years to pay off…</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> One way to tackle this is to migrate all the data you need to a new table. From there, you can delete your old data altogether (which is free). This way, you pay only to migrate the data you need, which is usually a small percentage of your total table.</p><p>In this post I’ll do a small overview of how we did that at Medium and the tools we used to estimate the costs of the different scenarios.</p><figure>&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024</figure> [...]<br>
