            The first benchmark results for the standard M3 chip surfaced <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/search?q=mac15%2C3">in the Geekbench 6 database</a> today, providing a closer look at the chip's CPU performance improvements.

<br/>
Based on the results so far, the M3 chip has single-core and multi-core scores of around 3,000 and 11,700, respectively. The standard M2 chip has single-core and multi-core scores of around 2,600 and 9,700, respectively, so the M3 chip is up to 20% faster than the M2 chip, as Apple claimed during its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/">"Scary Fast" event</a> on Monday.

            <p>While Postgres excels at supporting many workloads, including modern ones, there are still some workloads it cannot handle.  Two areas that Postgres is currently unable to handle involve large data

  </li><li>Write-heavy workloads that cannot be efficiently written by a single server
</li></ul>
<p>Postgres is a great general-purpose database, and it might be fine if Postgres were deemed unacceptable for such workloads, especially if supporting such workloads required a major redesign of Postgres. 
However, could Postgres be modified incrementally to support such workloads?  This is what the Postgres development community has been working on since

            Apple today seeded the fifth beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, the software that runs on the Vision Pro headset. The fourth beta <a href="">came out in early October</a>, so it has been nearly a month since Apple last released a ‌visionOS‌ update.

<br/>
Only a limited number of developers have access to Vision Pro at this time, with the headsets used for app testing purposes. Most people do not have access to the ‌visionOS‌ beta outside of Xcode, and it is not entirely clear what Apple is adding in each ‌visionOS‌ update. Apple has said that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> will be coming to ‌visionOS‌ soon, and it appears that it may be present in this fifth beta.
