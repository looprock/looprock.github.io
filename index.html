</p>
<p>I think "community edition" has several problems.  First, it suggests that there is a non-community edition, i.e., an enterprise edition.  While some companies do produce modified enterprise-focused
versions of Postgres, the community <em>only</em> produces one version of the source code which is designed for hobbyists, developers, small businesses, and large enterprises.

<p>A second problem is that companies that control the development of open source software often create a "community edition" of their software which is free, and an "enterpr</p> [...]<br>
