            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's latest series of custom silicon chips designed for the Mac come just over a year after the introduction of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip in 2022, so how much better really is M3?
<br/>

<br/>
With the introduction of the M3 series, encompassing the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips, Apple once again set new benchmarks in performance, efficiency, and capabilities for the Mac. The transition from ‌M2‌ to M3 is marked by significant enhancements, primarily thanks to Apple's move to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> process, among other key architectural improvements such as a completely redesigned GPU.

Sonos very rarely offers straight cash discounts on individual products, with typical sales throughout the year focusing on bundle sales. For Black Friday, the company is finally back with steep markdowns on numerous products, and you don't need to bundle or enter a code for the savings.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            This week on we’re joined by Emil Sjölander from Figma — talking about bringing Dev Mode to Figma.
