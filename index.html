            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's latest macOS Sequoia 15.3 update appears to have resolved a bug that prevented popular backup utility <a href="https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper</a> from creating bootable backups, according to developer Dave Nanian.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Threads is rolling out the ability for users to share custom feeds they've made, the social media platform announced on Tuesday.

"Shared feeds are a new way for you to connect with people around similar interests and find profiles and conversations that are relevant to you," said the Meta-owned company in a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/02/share-custom-feeds-on-threads/">newsroom post</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
The change means that users will be able to explore public feeds under a new Feeds tab on profiles, and pin feeds they like for quick access to their favorite people and topics.
<br/>
<br/>
Before custom feeds can be shared, they must be made public. This can be done by tapping and holding a feed, selecting "Edit feeds," and then toggling on the switch next to "Public feed."

Open source models like Llama, R1 from DeepSeek, etc have all contributed to this. It’s become even more clear the model calls themselves are commoditizing quickly. And this is great! If the variable ‘COGS’ component of marginal API call approaches zero, many of the questions listed above start to go away. You don’t worry about your margins shrinking, changing the pricing doesn’t become a must, etc. This in turn leads to a LOT more experimenting with AI features / functionalities.
