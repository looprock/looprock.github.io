            Ecovacs today announced the launch of its latest vacuuming and mopping robot, the Deebot X11 Omnicyclone. The HomeKit-compatible vacuum has several new features, including battery improvements, support for agentic AI and a 4WD climbing system that can cross higher room thresholds.

The X11 includes PowerBoost GaN fast-charging technology, allowing the robot to charge incrementally while cleaning its mop and emptying its dust container. The rapid bursts of charging power ensure that it cleans for a longer period of time without needing to stop for a long recharge.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            ASUS recently came out with a new 32-inch 6K ProArt Display that's priced at $1,399, so we thought we'd check it out to see how it compares with the Studio Display and the Pro Display XDR from Apple.

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>
<br/>
At 32 inches, the ProArt 6K is larger than the 27-inch Studio Display, but it is on par in size with the Pro Display XDR. ASUS doesn't have the same design aesthetic as Apple, so the ProArt 6K's design isn't impressive. There's a square-shaped base, an arm that attaches to the display, and thin bezels at the top and the sides. There's a thicker bottom bezel that houses some quick access control buttons.

<br/>
ASUS' display has the same 218 pixels per inch as the Pro Display XDR, and text looks crisp. Colors are accurate out of the box and can be further tweaked in the Settings menu with different profiles. HDR [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-03 12:00:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Astropad today announced the launch of <a href="http://astropad.com/freshcoat">Fresh Coat</a>, a new anti-reflective screen protector that's designed to make the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> easier to see outdoors and under bright lights.

<br/>
Fresh Coat is a glass screen protector that cuts down on up to 75 percent of reflections while preserving color accuracy.
<br/>
<br/>
We were able to try out Fresh Coat ahead of launch, and can confirm that it does indeed cut down on reflections without impacting the ‌iPhone‌'s color or display visibility, with no sign of haze. Astropad includes a tray that ensures a precise alignment and makes applying the screen protector foolproof, and it comes with an app clip that walks you through the installation process.

<br/>
This integration allows you to view and change modes (Stay, Away, and Disarm) directly from an Ecobee smart thermostat's tile in the Home app, or by using Siri voice commands on an iPhone or iPad.
