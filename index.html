            While the so-called "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/#iphone_17_air">iPhone 17 Air</a>" is not expected to launch until September, there are already plenty of rumors about the "ultra-thin" device.

<br/>
Overall, the "iPhone 17 Air" is shaping up to be a mixed bag. Due to its thinness, the device is expected to have some limited specifications compared to the iPhone 17 Pro models, including only a single rear camera, only a single speaker, no SIM card slot worldwide, and an A19 chip instead of the more powerful A19 Pro chip. Of course, the device will also be equipped with a smaller battery than other iPhone 17 models.
