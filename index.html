"Apple has blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the US App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union," Epic stated via its <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1923293522234356169">Fortnite account</a> on X (Twitter).

The good news is that the company has brought back the foldable design that was absent from its predecessor, the WH-1000XM5. The bad news is that it's stuck with the same naming convention, which sounds less like headphones and more like a dot-matrix printer from the 70s.
