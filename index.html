            <b>Published:</b> 2025-04-03 03:37:38-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is currently evaluating a new small-sized OLED display for its next iPad mini model, according to a Chinese leaker with sources in Apple's supply chain.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-972028" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/ipad-mini-7-feature-red-and-blue.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
Weibo-based account <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/Plxw01oFM">Digital Chat Station</a> today made the claim in a brief preview of upcoming tablets from different brands. The leaker went on to say that the OLED display in question is made by Samsung, but that they remain unsure if it features a higher refresh rate than the 60Hz LCD display used in the existing iPad mini 7. 
<br/>
<br/>
Reports last year claimed that Apple had requested OLED display panels designed for future iPad mini models from its suppliers.

In May 2024, it was reported that Samsung Display had &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/24/apple-developing-oled [...]<br>

Apple has worked to move some of its manufacturing to countries like India, Vietnam, and Thailand, all of which are facing steep tariffs in addition to China and Taiwan. There is a minimum 10 percent tariff for all U.S. trading partners, and "reciprocal tariffs" on several countries where Apple suppliers are located. Some of the tariffs:
