            The Phone app doesn't often get a lot of attention with iOS updates, but that's changing in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>. There are multiple new features to prevent unwanted calls and to save you time.

<h2 id="unified_design">Unified Design</h2>
<br/>
The Phone app has a new unified design, but there is an option to use the original <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> layout as well. The unified design puts recent calls, missed calls, and voicemails on a single screen.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-01 16:16:32-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            We're on the fourth developer beta and first public beta of macOS Tahoe, which means we're getting closer to the launch version that's set to come out in September. With macOS Tahoe now available to the public, we thought it would be a good time to share an initial review of the update.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>
<br/>
Like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, macOS Tahoe adopts the Liquid Glass design. It's used for the Dock, widgets, Control Center, menu bars, navigation bars in apps, app icons, and a few other places, but its implementation is less widespread than it is in iOS and iPadOS. It's clear that Liquid Glass was not a Mac-first design, and the glass parts of the interface feel cobbled together with the previous design language.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-01 15:40:23-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            CalDigit recently came out with the TS5 Plus, which is designed to work with Apple's Thunderbolt 5 Macs.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012987" height="1216" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/caldigit-ts5-plus.jpg" width="2162"/>
<br/>
The TS5 Plus looks like CalDigit's prior docks, featuring a simple rectangular shape and an aluminum build with some ridging at the top, bottom, and sides for visual interest and heat dissipation.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a black aluminum color that matches the Space Black of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macbook-pro/">M4 MacBook Pro</a> models, and it comes with a hefty 330W power brick. In fact, the power brick is longer than the dock itself, but it's flat and tucks away under a desk fairly well. The TS5 Plus is six inches long, five inches wide, and 1.8 inches thick, while the power brick is seven inches long, 3.5 inches wide, and a little under an inch thick.

"Apple must do this. Apple will do this. This is sort of ours to grab. We will make the investment to do it," Cook told employees.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple now considers second-generation Apple Watch Series 1 models released in 2016 to be obsolete, according to the company's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102772">vintage and obsolete products list</a>.

<br/>
Apple updated the list to move the Series 1 Apple Watch models from the vintage section to the obsolete section, as it has now been more than seven years since the devices were last offered for sale. The Series 1 models were sold alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-2/">Apple Watch Series 2</a> models, and were the successor to the original Apple Watch models. The Series 1 Apple Watch was almost identical to the original Apple Watch, but it had a faster S1P processor.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, currently in beta, your iPhone gains a handy new charging feature that takes the guesswork out of knowing when your device will be fully powered up. Instead of waiting around or checking your battery percentage every few minutes, you can now see exactly how much time remains until your device reaches 100%.

<br/>
"It's wonderful to see great momentum building for our platforms," said Cook, on a <a href="https://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/">conference call</a> discussing Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/31/apple-3q-2025-earnings/">quarterly earnings results</a>. "iOS 26, macOS 26, and iPadOS 26 are by far the most popular developer betas we've had."

Apple released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/get-ios-26-developer-beta-iphone/">developer betas</a> immediately following its WWDC 2025 keynote in June.
