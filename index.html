<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The approach is similar to existing industry techniques that use micro-perforated or nano-patterned glass to selectively improve IR transmission in a localized region above the sensor array.
<br/>

The report also suggests Apple's work has already prompted related suppliers to accelerate pr [...]<br>

            <p>I have attended over one hundred Postgres meetups over the years.  The usual format is:  food with individual discussion, lecture with group questions, and finally more individual
discussion.  I just spoke at an Armenia PostgreSQL User Group <a class="major" href="https://www.meetup.com/armenia-postgresql-user-group/events/312154434/" style="text-decoration: underline;">meetup</a> and the event organizer
<a class="txt2html" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emma-saroyan" style="text-decoration: none;">Emma Saroyan</a> did something different — she did a group mobile phone quiz after my lecture.  To create the quiz questions before the
event, she studied my slides and viewed a previous recording of my talk.  The winner got a copy of her book.
</p>
<p>I think the quiz was a great post-lecture group activity, and gave dynamism to the content.  I know people will remember the quiz fondly when they think about the meetup.  I encourage
all meetups to try similar quizzes, though they do take work to create.

            <p>The PostgreSQL Hacking Workshop will be taking a well-earned Christmas break in December of 2025. The future of the workshop is a little bit unclear, because I'm continuing to have a bit of trouble finding enough good talks online to justify doing one per month: the best source of talks for the event is <a href="http://pgconf.dev">pgconf.dev</a>, but not all of those talks are about hacking on PostgreSQL, and not all of those that are about hacking are equally interesting to potential attendees. Also, we've already eaten through much of the backlog of older hacking-related talks that are posted online. Many conferences have few hacking-related talks, or just don't post any videos (which are expensive and time-consuming to produce).<span></span></p><a href="https://rhaas.blogspot.com/2025/12/the-future-of-postgresql-hacking.html#more">Read more »</a><br>

<p>ChatGPT 5.1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p><em>Anodyne</em> (adj. or noun):</p>
<ol>
<li>Something that relieves pain or soothes;</li>
<li>By extension, a remark, policy, or idea that is inoffensive, bland, and so safe it has essentially no substance.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How it’s actually used</strong></p>
<p>In modern writing, people usually mean sense #2: an <em>anodyne statement</em> is technically fine, offends no one, and also does fuck-all to advance the conversation. It’s the corporate press-release vibe: “We take your concerns seriously and are committed to moving forward together.” Totally smooth, totally empty.</p>
<p><strong>Why it feels like a shibboleth</strong></p>
<p>You’re right that <em>anodyne</em> functions as a kind of soft flex:</p></blockquote> [...]<br>
