            iOS 26 improves the Apple Music Replay viewing experience.

<br/>
As spotted <a href="https://x.com/hiddecollee7/status/1933049424898388428">by Hidde Collee</a> and others, Apple Music Replay is now a completely native feature on iOS 26. This means that you can see your monthly and yearly listening statistics directly in the Apple Music app, rather than in a popover web view.
<br/>
<br/>
This change is minor in the grand scheme of things, but for many Apple Music enthusiasts, it is a long-awaited improvement.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple Music Replay is similar to Spotify Wrapped, showcasing the top songs and artists that you listen to each year, complete with a year-end highlight reel.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple Music Replay is available for most of the year, though.

<br/>
AutoMix is designed to transition from one song to another as the song that's playing ends, using time stretching and beat matching for a seamless shift. Apple says that it's meant to work "like a DJ."
<br/>
<br/>
Songs are designed to transition at the "perfect moment," based on an analysis of the key and tempo of the music. AutoMix replaces Crossfade, and can be enabled when opening up ‌Apple Music‌ after updating to ‌iOS 26‌.

            Apple's iPhone development roadmap runs several years into the future and the company is continually working with suppliers on several successive iPhone models simultaneously, which is why we often get rumored features months ahead of launch. The iPhone 17 series is no different, and we already have a good idea of what to expect from Apple's 2025 smartphone lineup.
<br/>

<br/>
If you skipped the iPhone 16, or if you're just plain curious about what's on the horizon, here are 17 rumored features that we are expecting to arrive in time for Apple's successor lineup, the iPhone 17 series, which is likely to be released around mid-September.

Software engineer <a href="https://x.com/wongmjane/status/1932282217218400556">Jane Manchun Wong discovered</a> that iOS 26 can automatically fill in one-time verification codes from third-party apps, like Google Voice.

iPhone users will be able to wirelessly stream videos to the CarPlay screen using AirPlay, according to Apple. For safety reasons, video playback will only be available when the vehicle is parked, to prevent distracted driving. The connected iPhone will be able to detect when the vehicle is in motion and end playback.

Apple says that automakers need to add support for CarPlay with AirPlay video, so it will likely take some time to roll out.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iOS 26, Apple has introduced some major changes to the iPhone experience, headlined by the new Liquid Glass redesign that's available across <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/ios-26-supports-iphone-11-and-newer/">all compatible devices</a>. However, several of the update's features are exclusive to iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 models, since they rely on Apple Intelligence.

<br/>
The following features are powered by on-device large language models and machine learning, which require the advanced neural processing capabilities found in Apple's latest A-series chips. Here's what iPhone 15 Pro users and newer can expect from iOS 26 that older device owners will miss out on.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iPadOS 26, Apple has introduced a new multitasking UI that allows for several open apps at the same time. You can change the size of ‌iPad‌ app windows, move them on top of each other, and rearrange them as desired, much like on the Mac. In a new interview with <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/apples-craig-federighi-on-the-long-road-to-the-ipads-mac-like-multitasking/">Ars Technica</a></em>, Apple's software chief Craig Federighi has explained why the iPad took so long to gain proper windowed multitasking.

<br/>
The delay apparently stemmed from early hardware limitations. According to Federighi, original iPads lacked the power for true multitasking, and the touch-first interface demanded perfect responsiveness.

            Barnes &amp; Noble has updated its Nook app for iPhone and iPad with a new "buy on BN.com" button that redirects users to the company's website to complete e-book and audiobook purchases (via <em><a href="https://goodereader.com/blog/barnes-and-noble-nook-ereader-news/barnes-and-noble-nook-app-for-ios-can-buy-books-in-the-app">GoodReader</a></em>).

<br/>
The button appears alongside book listings and opens the user's default browser to the corresponding product page on Barnes &amp; Noble's website. After completing the purchase, content automatically syncs to the Nook app and any connected Nook devices.

Apple has multiple Accessibility options that are designed to customize iOS for different visual needs, and one of these options is Reduce Transparency.
