            Apple today shared a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6K4eUO53-UE">"Blue Screen of Death" ad</a> that appears to mock a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/19/global-it-outage-limited-to-windows-pcs/">major Windows computer outage</a> that occurred last year, following a faulty CrowdStrike security update. Macs were unaffected, and they were unlikely to ever be, as Apple has gradually restricted low-level access to the macOS operating system.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The humorous ad stars "The Underdogs," a fictional team of workers who overcome obstacles by using Apple products and features. 
<br/>
<br/>
"The Underdogs are ready for their first-ever trade show until a PC outage strikes and the Blue Screen of Death threatens their beloved Container Con," says Apple, in the video's description. "Thanks to the security of their Apple products, the Underdogs are unaffected and experience extraordinary success."

            If you make a call and are placed on hold, a new feature in ‌iOS 26‌ will do the waiting for you so you can do other things. Hold Assist listens for hold music playing, and then alerts you when a person comes on the line so you can pick up the call.

Hold Assist is available on any iPhone that supports iOS 26 (i.e. it's not an Apple Intelligence feature).

When you're placed on hold during a phone call, Hold Assist will launch automatically after 10 to 15 seconds. You'll know about it when a notification appears on your screen asking "Hold this Call?" Tap the <strong>Hold</strong> [...]<br>
