            The third beta of tvOS 18.2 that Apple provided to developers today adds a selection of new Snoopy screen savers that can be set as an alternative to the aerial, memory, and portrait screen saver options.

<br/>
Apple first announced the Snoopy screen savers way back in June when tvOS 18 was first unveiled, but there has been no sign of them since then. With tvOS 18.2, Snoopy fans will finally be able to set Snoopy as their screen saver.
<br/>

Apple has an existing partnership with Peanuts, and there is already a Snoopy watch face available on the Apple Watch.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            New M4-based Macs are reportedly unable to run virtual machines of older macOS versions prior to macOS Ventura 13.4, according to user reports and developer findings.

According to an <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2024/11/14/m4-macs-cant-virtualise-older-macos/">in-depth write-up</a> by the <em>Eclectic Light Company</em>'s Howard Oakley, security researcher Csaba Fitzl highlighted the issue, which has been documented in Apple Feedback and affects popular virtualization software including <a href="https://mac.getutm.app">UTM</a>. When attempting to run a virtual machine with an earlier version of macOS on M4 Macs, users encounter a black screen, and the VM fails to boot entirely.

            With the introduction of Apple Intelligence in iOS 18.1, communicating with Siri has become more flexible since you can easily type your requests instead of speaking them. It's a subtle but powerful change that's perfect for those moments when you need to be quiet or discrete.

Enabling Type to Siri is straightforward. Head to <strong>Settings -&gt; Apple Intelligence &amp; Siri</strong>, tap <strong>Talk &amp; Type to Siri</strong>, and make sure the <strong>Type to Siri</strong> toggle is switched on.

The typing interface includes suggested requests to help you get started, and you can type virtually anything you'd normally say to Siri. Simply enter your query and tap the up arrow to submit. Siri will resp [...]<br>
