<br/>
In Reminders, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> can now suggest relevant tasks and items automatically, such as to-dos pulled from emails or notes, or grocery items based on your habits and patterns. These suggestions are contextual, personalized, and designed to reduce the friction of capturing tasks manually.
<br/>
<br/>
Beyond that, Reminders can now intelligently organize your lists by automatically categorizing related tasks into grouped sections—such as separating groceries, errands, or work-related items—without the need for manual sorting.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple at WWDC announced iOS 26, introducing a comprehensive visual redesign built around its new "Liquid Glass" concept, alongside expanded Apple Intelligence capabilities, updates to core communication apps, and more.

Liquid Glass is a translucent material that reflects and refracts surroundings to create dynamic, responsive interface elements, according to Apple. The new design language transforms the Lock Screen, where the time fluidly adapts to available space in wallpapers, and spatial scenes add 3D effects when users move their iPhone. Meanwhile, app icons and widgets gain new customization options, including a striking clear appearance.

The centerpiece of the multitasking improvements is a new macOS-style windowing system.
