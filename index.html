            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today stopped signing the iOS 17.2.1 update, preventing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users from downgrading to that version of iOS going forward. iOS 17.2.1 is no longer being signed following the January 22 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/22/apple-releases-ios-17-3/">release of iOS 17.3</a>, which introduced Stolen Device Protection for the ‌iPhone‌ <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-3-features/">and other changes</a>.

<br/>
It is not unusual that iOS 17.2.1 is no longer being signed. Apple routinely stops signing older versions of iOS after new releases in order to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date and to prevent users from downgrading to older, less secure versions of the ‌iPhone‌ operating system.

Apple does not provide details on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware, so it is unclear what's new. The <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/106340">limited release notes</a> for the update list only "bug fixes and other improvements."
