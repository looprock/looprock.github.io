            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 12:48:32-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the watchOS 11.4 update that's set to be released soon, Apple is making a small but useful change to the way that alarms work on the Apple Watch. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996385" height="800" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/watchos-11-4-alarm.jpg" width="1422"/>
<br/>
The update includes an option to allow the Wake Up alarm you set up for Sleep mode to break through when Silent Mode is activated on your watch, which means you'll be less likely to sleep through your alarm going off. 
<br/>
<br/>
Right now, if you have Silent Mode turned on, your Apple Watch alarm will use haptic feedback vibrations to tap you on the wrist to wake you, but it won't make noise. Some people are able to easily sleep through the gentle tapping of the alarm, but a loud noise is harder to ignore. 
<br/>
<br/>
The Break Through Silent Mode option can be found by going to the Sleep app on Apple Watch, tapping on Sounds &amp; Haptics, and toggling on the setting. Fr [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In a <a href="http://www.theresistornetwork.com/2025/03/thinking-different-thinking-slowly-llms.html">blog post</a> this week, software engineer Andrew Rossignol (my brother!) detailed how he managed to run generative AI on an old PowerBook G4.

<br/>
While hardware requirements for large language models (LLMs) are typically high, this particular PowerBook G4 model from 2005 is equipped with a mere 1.5GHz PowerPC G4 processor and 1GB of RAM. Despite this 20-year-old hardware, my brother was able to achieve inference with Meta's LLM model Llama 2 on the laptop.
<br/>
<br/>
The experiment involved porting the open-source llama2.c project, and then accelerating performance with a PowerPC vector extension called AltiVec.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 09:47:45-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Earlier this month, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ios-19-macos-16-major-design-update/">reported</a> that Apple is planning "one of the most dramatic software overhauls in the company's history" – an update that aims to bring iOS, iPadOS, and macOS into closer visual alignment. The redesign is said to be "loosely based" on visionOS, the software behind Apple's Vision Pro headset, and will reportedly update the look of icons, menus, apps, windows, and system buttons.

<br/>
These changes are expected to arrive later this year with iOS 19, iPadOS 19, and macOS 16, and are said to go "well beyond a new design language and aesthetic tweaks." More specific details are scarce, but it's supposedly the biggest update to iOS since iOS 7, and the biggest update to macOS since Big Sur.
