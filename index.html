Statistics continually show migrants commit fewer crimes than American citizens while doing other useful things like paying taxes and providing an incredibly reliable workforce. [&#8230;]<br>

ESPN held the rights to "Sunday Night Baseball" through the 2028 season, but the network and MLB mutually opted out of the $550-million contract earlier this year, so ESPN's rights now expire after the 2025 season.

Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1945871948468404342">said</a> Samsung's next-generation Galaxy Z Fold 8 will use the same laser-drilled metal display plate as the foldable iPhone, with the component to be supplied by South Korean company Fine M-Tec.
<br/>
<br/>
Samsung's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/samsung-galaxy-z-fold7/">new Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> still has a visible crease in the middle of its inner screen. However, Kuo said that Apple's stricter crease-free requirement for the foldable iPhone has essentially raised the bar for foldable devices, so it sounds like next year's Galaxy Z Fold 8 will feature a "crease-free" screen as well.

            A new rumor out of China today has sparked speculation that Apple may be readying a unique new iPhone 17 Pro color that somehow reflects the new design language of its iOS 26 software.

<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1011198" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iPhone-17-Pro-Iridescent-Feature-2.5.jpg" width="2500"/>

Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://t.co/nBP4VF7qri">Instant Digital</a> on Thursday hinted that the iPhone 17 Pro has a "special" color variant that is said to be "connected to the iOS 26 Liquid Glass design."

While speculative, a white base material that subtly shifts hues depending on light and angle could add a dynamic, refractive quality to the color. Combined with the Liquid Glass UI [...]<br>

            Earlier this year, I was a part of a CNN documentary, Twitter: Breaking the Bird, which gave me much pause for reflection about the state of social media and how we got here.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-07-17 04:27:46-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            You may have missed it, but select Apple Watch models are gaining a new Wrist Flick gesture in watchOS 26 that allows users to dismiss notifications and return to their watch face with a simple wrist movement.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1007304" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/watchos-26-gradient-light.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
The gesture works by turning your wrist over and back, using the accelerometer and gyroscope to detect the motion. With the gesture, you can dismiss incoming notifications, mute calls, silence alarms and alerts, and return to the watch face without needing to use your other hand.
<br/>
<br/>
Wrist Flick joins the existing Double Tap gesture as another one-handed control option for Apple Watch users. The feature can be toggled on or off in Settings ➝ Gestures ➝ Wrist Flick.
<br/>

The new gesture is only available on Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch 10, and Apple Watch Ultra 2 – the same models that s [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            OpenAI has expanded access to Record Mode in ChatGPT for macOS, bringing the AI-powered transcription feature to Plus subscribers after its initial rollout to business users <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSRViLugE0">last month</a>.

<br/>
The new capability adds a simple "Record" button to the input window in the desktop app that allows you to capture both microphone and system audio during meetings or calls. 
<br/>
<br/>
When recording stops, ChatGPT processes the audio on OpenAI's servers, generating structured notes complete with summaries, action items, and timestamped references. Microphone and system audio permissions must be enabled by the user first.

Sessions are limited to 120 minutes, with the original audio deleted after transcription. It's likely to be a convenient addition for some paying ChatGP [...]<br>
