            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WhatsApp for iPad finally appears to be nearing a release. In the latest version of WhatsApp Beta for TestFlight, Meta has introduced an option to use WhatsApp on an iPad independently of an iPhone, thanks to an update to its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-whatsapp-account-multiple-phones/">Link a Device</a> feature.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
WhatsApp currently allows users of the encrypted messaging platform to link up to four devices to their account even when their main smartphone is not connected to the internet. Each linked device connects to WhatsApp independently, ensuring that personal messages, media, and calls are end-to-end encrypted. The feature also supports Macs, but not iPads – until now.

They migrated their data marts from Amazon Aurora to TiDB, a Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP) database, to overcome scalability, data integrity, and latency issues. TiDB's architecture separated computing from storage, providing easy scaling, ACID compliance, high availability, and real-time analytics. Delhivery's TiDB infrastructure spans multiple availability zones and underwent critical tuning for optimal performance. They reported improved query performance, easy data migration, and strong support from PingCAP.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>A little while ago, Etsy introduced a new feature in its iOS app that could place Etsy sellers' artwork on a user's wall using Apple's Augmented Reality (AR) tools. It let them visualize how a piece would look in their space, and even gave them an idea of its size options. When we launched the feature as a beta, it was only available in "wall art"-related categories, and after the initial rollout we were eager to expand it to work with more categories. </p>
<p>What differentiates Etsy is the nature of our sellers’ unique items. Our sellers create offerings that can be personalized in numbers of ways, and they often hand-make orders based on demand. Taking the same approach we did with wall art and attempting to show 3D models of millions of Etsy items – many of which could be further customized – would be a huge undertaking. Nevertheless, with inspiration from <a href="https://careers.etsy.com/global/en/guiding-principles">Etsy's Guiding Principles</a>, we decided to dig deeper into the feature. What could</p> [...]<br>
