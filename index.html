            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            It&#8217;s been a decade since a federal court declared the New York Police Department&#8217;s stop-and-frisk program (mostly) illegal.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-09-13 19:00:05-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The new iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max all support DisplayPort for up to 4K HDR video mirroring and video output to an external display or TV, according to Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-15-pro/specs/">tech specs</a> for the devices.

<br/>
DisplayPort support is built into the USB-C port on all iPhone 15 models, meaning that the devices can output video at up to 4K/60Hz natively to a DisplayPort-equipped external display or TV with a supported USB-C to DisplayPort cable. Alternatively, you can use Apple's $69 <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUF82AM/A/usb-c-digital-av-multiport-adapter">USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter</a> to mirror video from any iPhone 15 to an HDMI-equipped TV or display at up to 4K/60Hz, but HDR is not supported this way.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-09-13 18:05:01-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The new iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are equipped with a customizable Action button that replaces the traditional mute switch on previous iPhones. By default, the button is set to toggle between Ring and Silent modes, but it can also be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-action-button-everything-it-can-do/">assigned to a different action</a> for quick access to the camera, flashlight, Voice Memos, and more.

<br/>
One of the options for the Action button will be the Translate app, allowing you to quickly start translating between two languages without having to open the app. However, fine print on Apple's website says the Translate option will not be available for the Action button until later this year, suggesting that it will be enabled in a future iOS 17 update.

            With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-releases-ios-17-rc/">iOS 17 release candidate</a> that came out yesterday, Apple added a new "Grid Forecast" section to the Home app. The feature is designed to use your location to tell you when "clean" energy is available to use, so you can be mindful of when you're using energy.

<br/>
According to Apple, the energy sources that are used to power a home can change throughout the day. When the forecast reads "Cleaner," it means that the available energy sources may have lower carbon emissions. When it reads "Less Clean," available energy sources that are powering the grid may emit more carbon into the atmosphere.

Apple suggests that users can take advantage of this forecast to decide when to use electricity in situations where energy usage can be timed. [...]<br>
