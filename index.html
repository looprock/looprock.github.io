            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            All four iPhone 17 models launching later this year will feature an upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera, according to analyst Jeff Pu.

<br/>
In a research note today with investment firm GF Securities, Pu shared a chart in which he reiterated that the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will each be equipped with a 24-megapixel front camera. By comparison, all four iPhone 16 models are equipped with a 12-megapixel front camera.
<br/>
<br/>
Another analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo, also claimed that at least one iPhone 17 model <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/kuo-iphone-17-to-feature-24mp-front-facing-camera/">would be equipped with a 24-megapixel front camera</a>, so this upgrade has been rumored by multiple sources. Kuo said it will "significantly improve the image quality."

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            While the iPhone 17 series is still around six months away, a rumor pertaining to next year's iPhone 18 series has already surfaced.

<br/>
In a research note with investment firm GF Securities today, analyst Jeff Pu said the A20 chip for the iPhone 18 models will be manufactured with TSMC's third-generation 3nm process, known as N3P. That is the same process that is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/18/a19-and-a19-pro-n3p-rumor/">expected to be used for the A19 and A19 Pro chips</a> coming in the iPhone 17 models, so the iPhone 18 models could have relatively small overall performance improvements compared to the previous generation.

Pu does expect the A20 chip to have one upgrade that he said will benefit Apple Intelligence capabilities. Specifically, he said the chip will use TSMC's so-called &lt;a  [...]<br>

            Yesterday, analyst Jeff Pu said Apple's first two foldable devices will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/apple-foldables-mass-production-2026/">enter mass production in the second half of 2026</a>. Today, he provided some additional details about these devices, which are expected to launch in 2026 or 2027.

<br/>
In a research note with investment firm GF Securities, Pu said the two devices will include a foldable iPhone with a 7.8-inch inner display, along with a larger foldable device with an 18.8-inch display. He described the larger foldable as a MacBook-iPad hybrid, and he believes that the device will likely run macOS, rather than iPadOS.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            All four iPhone 17 models will feature an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip, according to Jeff Pu, an analyst who covers companies within Apple's supply chain.

<br/>
In a research note with investment firm GF Securities today, Pu said he believes that the Wi-Fi 7 chip's design was finalized in the first half of 2024. He expects the chip to debut in the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max later this year.

            Snap, the company behind the Snapchat social network, has been quietly working on AR glasses for the last several months, and this week, the developer-only AR Spectacles were <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/six-months-of-spectacles">updated with some new features</a>.

<br/>
Developers can now build GPS-based experiences for things like creating interactive walking paths, getting directions, tracking fitness metrics, and playing games.

Snap also added updated hand tracking capabilities for grabbing items and improving typing with the AR keyboard, plus new features like leaderboard support and opening links to Lenses from message threads.

<br/>
<br/>
Apple's new store at Crocker Park will be larger and more modern than its original store at the shopping center, which first opened in 2008. At many of Apple's newer stores, there is an Apple Pickup station where customers can collect online orders, along with a Genius Bar with counters set at varied heights for improved accessibility.

<br/>
I've spent a few weeks testing out the Ark Pro, and I've found that it packs a nice punch with 27,600 mAh of juice and a trio of USB ports and the ability to charge a laptop at up to 140 watts.
<br/>
<br/>
You'll find a lot of beefy power banks coming in at around this same mAh rating, and that's because 27,600 mAh translates to 99.36 Wh in this battery, which is just under the 100 Wh limit for carrying it on an airplane without needing to get approval from the airline.

Apple's website says the extra trade-in credit for Macs is available with the purchase of an eligible new Apple device through April 2, yet the values listed have already decreased before that date, which is something the average customer likely wouldn't realize.

As of February 9, the listed trade-in values had increased by between $10 and $50 in the U.S., but some of the values have already decreased since then.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 06:42:47-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In an investor research note today with British bank Barclays, analyst Tim Long said Apple's first foldable iPhone could have a starting price in the $2,300 range in the United States, which would make it by far the most expensive iPhone model ever.

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964745" height="1009" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-pro-models-1.jpg" width="1794"/>
<br/>
If the first foldable iPhone starts at $2,299, that means it would cost nearly twice as much as the iPhone 16 Pro Max, which starts at $1,199.
<br/>
<br/>
Long shared this pricing estimate following a recent trip to Asia, where his team met with hardware manufacturers. He said there is increasing discussion within the supply chain about a foldable iPhone launching in late 2026 to early 2027, but he believes that the device's higher starting price would unsurprisingly limit sales volume.
