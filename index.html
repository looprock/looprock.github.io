            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Instead of implementing the code that works, start with code structure first, but use your imagination - imagine someone already implemented all the parts you need for your feature, and your task is to integrate these parts. Use components that don't exist yet, functions that are not yet implemented, and custom hooks you just made up. Avoid writing primitive expressions. Refine the design until it looks like it's going to work. Use the same principles on lower levels if applicable. Only after that, start implementing.<br>

<p>The Feature Systems team at Etsy is responsible for the platform and services through which machine learning (ML) practitioners create, manage and consume feature data for their machine learning models. We recently made new real-time features available through our streaming feature platform, Rivulet, where we return things like “most recent add-to-carts.” While timeseries data itself wasn’t new to our system, these newer features from our streaming feature service would be the first timeseries inputs to be supplied to our ML models themselves to inform search, ads, and recommendations use cases.</p>
<p>Not too long after we made these features available to users for ML model training, we received a message from Harshal, an ML practitioner on Recommendations, warning us of "major problems" lying in wait.
