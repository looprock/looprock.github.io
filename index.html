            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In a <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/UeiC07s0qRrd1L">research note</a> today, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that MacBook Pro models with M5 chips might not launch until 2026.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974025" height="2160" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-MacBook-Pro-M4-hero.jpg" width="3840"/>
<br/>
Kuo discussed how the A20 chips in iPhone 18 models will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/iphone-18-pro-a20-chip-with-new-design/">packaged with WMCM (Wafer-Level Multi-Chip Module) technology</a>, which integrates the so-called "underfill and molding processes" for more efficient manufacturing and increased yield, a term that refers to the percentage of functional chips that can be obtained per silicon wafer.
<br/>
<br/>
Kuo went on to say that high-end M5 chips in 2026 MacBooks — likely referring to the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips — will continue to have separate underfill and molding processes during pro [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-12 08:19:22-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's Wallet app in iOS 26 includes a new feature that lets you store physical card information alongside your digital payment cards. This allows you to quickly access account numbers, expiry dates, and other details without carrying the physical card.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899453" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Wallet-16x9.jpeg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
It's a simple addition in iOS 26, but it brings the Wallet app closer to being a comprehensive card management tool, filling the gap that third-party apps like 1Password typically fill. With the full card information to hand, you can check your card's expiry date for a subscription service or provide account details over the phone, without needing to dig through your physical wallet or memorize card numbers. It also means you don't have to delve into settings to find Safari's Autofill fields.

            Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 Air will include an A19 Pro chip with a 5-core GPU, according to Weibo leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/5821279480/PFt8mzQAF">Fixed Focus Digital</a>. The Chinese account, which has over two million followers, claims that only the iPhone 17 Pro models will have the full 6-core GPU A19 Pro configuration.

<br/>
It's the second time in as many months that Fixed Focus Digital has claimed to reveal accurate details about the ultra-thin device's chip specifications. The reduced GPU core count suggests Apple is using binned chips based on yields, or may be managing thermal constraints in the slimmer form factor, but most users are unlikely to notice the performance difference during typical usage.

            There’s a trick at the center of American political discourse—so deeply embedded that even well-meaning people don’t realize they’re performing it. It goes like this: if you’re a fair-minded individual, you must believe that both political parties are fundamentally the same.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            An in-person Live Translation feature could soon be available on the AirPods, according to imagery found in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> beta 6.

<br/>
There's a picture of the AirPods with Hello in several different languages, along with a suggestion that the feature will be activated with a double press. The file itself is named "Translate," which certainly seems to imply that there will be a gesture to activate a Live Translation option.
