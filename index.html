            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Google today announced the launch of a new "Help me Write" feature that is available for the Chrome browser on both Macs and Windows PCs. It is a tool that is able to help users start writing something, or refine something that's already been written.

<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937562" height="889" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/google-help-me-write-example-1.jpg" width="1581"/>
<br/>
Help me Write uses the Gemini model that Google announced back in December. At the time, Google said that Gemini was its most capable and general model to date, created through large-scale collaborative efforts by teams across Google.
<br/>
<br/>
According to Google, the Help me Write feature can be used for everything from online reviews to support requests to product listings. The AI model is able to understand the context of the webpage that the user is on to provide suggestions for relevant content.
