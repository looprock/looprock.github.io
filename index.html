The change allows users to experience immersive audio that enhances the spatial perception of sound, previously achievable only with external hardware.

<br/>
On iPhone and iPad, Live Photos bring your pictures to life by adding a few seconds of video before and after the shot, creating a living memory rather than a static image. 
<br/>
<br/>
While Live Photos are great on their own, it's also possible to weave several together to create a video montage. This process transforms a collection of moments into a cohesive narrative, and offers an easier way to share and relive your memories.

As noted by David Tesler (via <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/30/screenshots-suggest-tiktok-is-circumventing-apple-app-store-commissions/">TechCrunch</a></em>) TikTok has been offering a limited number of TikTok app users an option to purchase coins on TikTok.com instead of in the app. "Try recharging on tiktok.com to avoid in-app service fees," reads the text. "You can save the service fee and get access to popular payment methods."

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iOS 17.5, Apple is adding a "Repair State" feature that is designed to allow an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to be sent in for service without deactivating <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> and Activation Lock. The fourth iOS 17.5 beta that came out today adds a "Remove This Device" option for all devices in ‌Find My‌, and using it with an ‌iPhone‌ puts that ‌iPhone‌ into the new Repair State.

            Apple today released a firmware update for the USB-C <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> that came out last year.

<br/>
There is no word on what features, fixes, or updates might be included in the new firmware, and Apple does not offer release notes for ‌Apple Pencil‌ software releases.

The USB-C ‌Apple Pencil‌ is nearly identical in design to the ‌Apple Pencil‌ 2, but it is shorter and has a hidden USB-C port for charging and pairing. It cannot wirelessly charge, and it lacks some of the features available with the more expensive ‌Apple Pencil‌ models such as pressure sensitivity.
