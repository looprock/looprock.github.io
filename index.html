<br/>
According to technology columnist <a href="https://www.culpium.com/p/apple-doubles-down-with-second-chip">Tim Culpan</a>, TSMC has now started producing Apple's S9 System-in-Package (SiP) chip near Phoenix, Arizona at its Fab 21 plant. The company commenced production of the A16 Bionic chip for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus at the facility last year.
<br/>
<br/>
The S9 debuted in the Apple Watch Series 9 in late 2023, based on processing features derived from the A16 Bionic chip. Both products are produced using TSMC's 4-nanometer process technology, known simply as "N4." This shared te [...]<br>

            Apple in October 2024 overhauled its 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, adding M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips, Thunderbolt 5 ports on higher-end models, display changes, and more. That's quite a lot of updates in one go, but if you think this means a further major refresh for the MacBook Pro is now several years away, think again.

Indonesia's minister of industry, Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita, reportedly met with Apple's VP of global government affairs, Nick Ammann, on January 7 to discuss Apple's investment proposal. However, Agus later implied that the company's proposal was not yet adequate. "If it is $1 billion, then that is not enough," he told reporters after the meeting.

            Razer <a href="https://press.razer.com/product-news/ces-2025/">today introduced</a> Project Arielle, a next-generation conceptual gaming chair that it is developing. The mesh gaming chair has integrated heating and cooling functions thanks to a bladeless fan system located at the base of the backrest.

<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The chair offers three adjustable fan speeds for personalized cooling, and Razer says that the heat dissipation offered by the airflow can reduce perceived temperatures by up 2°C to 5°C in dry environments.

<br/>
When it's cooler, there's a built-in heating system that uses energy-efficient PTC heatings delivering up to 30°C of warm air. According to Razer, the chair's noise level is as "soft as a whisper," with the various functions able to be controlled through a touch panel on the chair's arm.

In a follow-up <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1876731783586136304">social media post</a>, Gurman said an iPhone SE replacement and new iPads are "being developed on the iOS 18.3 train," but that "doesn't mean" the software updates and the devices will launch simultaneously.

<h2>The Freedom to Choose – Why It Matters</h2>

The freedom to choose default apps on iPhone represents a marked shift in Apple's traditionally closed ecosystem, giving you more control over how you interact with your device. Rather than being locked into Safari for web browsing or Apple Mail for email, you can now set third-party alternatives like Chrome, Firefox, Gmail, or Outlook as your go-to apps.

This means when you tap a link or email address, your iPhone will automatically open your preferred app instead of Apple's built-in options. The change effectively elimin [...]<br>
