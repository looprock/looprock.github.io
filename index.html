I was able to test the Doorbell Camera Hub G410 ahead of launch, and it's a solid doorbell camera, and even better if you have an Aqara setup or plan to get more Aqara products. The G410 includes a Matter controller and it is able to serve as a hub for other Aqara Zigbee devices, like Aqara's door locks, so you don't need a standalone hub that doesn't serve another purpose. For Thread-based devices, it's also a Thread border router that can improve connectivity.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple will launch its new iPhone 17 series in two months, and the iPhone 17 Pro models are expected to get a new design for the rear casing and the camera area. But more significant changes to the lineup are not expected until next year, when the iPhone 18 models arrive.

<br/>
If you're thinking of trading in your iPhone for this year's latest, consider the following features rumored to be coming to the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max models – as well as a rumored new premium iPhone model for 2026. Taken together, they may just give you pause for thought.
