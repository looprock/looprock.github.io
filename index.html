Not A Bot is being tested in New Zealand and the Phillipines at the current time, and it only applies to new users. The X support account says that existing users are not affected "within this test."

            A higher-end <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> with a mini-LED 32-inch display will come out in 2025, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1714350456565350625">Apple analyst Ming-Chi</a> Kuo. Kuo does not specify, but this machine could be positioned as an "‌iMac‌ Pro" to replace the 2017 model that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/19/imac-pro-officially-discontinued/">discontinued two years ago</a>.

There have been multiple rumors of a larger ‌iMac‌ over the last couple of years, but the information has been confused with standalone display options and products that Apple ultimately shelved, leading to some confusion over if and when we would see a larger ‌iMac‌ option. The 27-inch ‌iMac‌ was also nixed in 2022.

Kuo does not mention which chip Apple will use, but Gurman has claimed that Apple will use the M3 chip in the ‌iMac‌. The M3 chip is expected to feature an 8-core GPU and 10-core GPU, and because it is built on a new 3-nanometer process, it will have performance and efficiency improvements.

            <p>Postgres's <a class="txt2html" href="https://momjian.us/main/presentations/extended.html#non-relational" style="text-decoration: none;">non-relational</a> data type support has greatly increased its adoption in recent years.  The use cases I have heard is that
Postgres supports relational data, and it supports non-relational data like JSON.  This ability is often called <a class="txt2html" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-model_database" style="text-decoration: none;">multi-model.</a>
</p>
<p>However, I am not sure if that is the right focus — it highlights Postgres's ability to store <em>two</em> types of data workloads in the same system, but it doesn't highlight the power of supporting data that
can be seamlessly organized using both systems — let me explain.

<p>People normally say, "Oh, I can store my financial data using Postgres's relational data types, and I can store my browser data in JSONB."  However, what about storing most of your financial data
