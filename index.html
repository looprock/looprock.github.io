            <b>Published:</b> 2024-09-26 04:47:44-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Disney+ has announced a new "Paid Sharing" program across multiple countries, including the United States, Canada, and parts of Europe, as its global account sharing crackdown kicks up a gear. The move, which was announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/disney-plus-password-sharing-crackdown/">earlier this year</a> by Disney CEO Bob Iger, aims to boost revenue and subscriber growth for the streaming service.

<br/>
Similar to Netflix's approach, the new system restricts account usage to members of a single household. Disney+ <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/paid-sharing-disney-explainer/">defines a household</a> as "a collection of devices associated with your primary personal residence that are used by the individuals who reside there."

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18, Apple added several new accessibility features, and one feature in particular that is likely to have widespread appeal among car passengers is Vehicle Motion Cues, which aims to prevent motion sickness when looking at an iPhone or iPad.
<br/>

<br/>
According to Apple, research shows that motion sickness is commonly caused by a sensory conflict between what a person sees and what they feel, which can prevent some users from comfortably using an ‌iPhone‌ or ‌iPad‌ while riding in a moving vehicle.

Vehicle Motion Cues are designed to avoid this sensory conflict with the use of visual elements on the display that indicate real-time changes in motion. Apple explains:

<blockquote>With Vehicle Motion Cues, animated dots on the edges of the screen represent changes in vehicle motion to help reduce sensory conf</blockquote> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Facebook parent company Meta today unveiled "the most advanced pair of AR glasses ever made," called Orion. Meta claims Orion looks and feels like a regular pair of glasses, but with augmented reality capabilities.

<br/>
The glasses have been in development for the last five years, and Meta describes them as lightweight and great for indoor and outdoor use. Unlike a VR headset, AR glasses augment the real world rather than shutting it out, providing digital experiences that are not constrained by the display of a smartphone or headset.<blockquote>Orion has the largest field of view in the smallest AR glasses form to date. That field of view unlocks truly immersive use cases for Orion, from multitasking windows and big-screen entertainment to life-size holograms of people - all digital content that can seamlessly blend with </blockquote> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's latest iPhone 16 models include a new Camera Control button (located on the lower right-hand side when holding the phone in portrait mode). The new button aims to make it easier to adjust photography settings when shooting with the iPhone in both portrait and landscape orientation.

A simple press of the Camera Control button brings up the Camera app when the iPhone is unlocked. Once the Camera app is open, another press takes a picture, while pressing and holding the button records video for as long as you hold it down.
<br/>

Within the Camera app, a light press on the button engages a haptic click that also allows for adjusting things like manual exposure and zoom, thanks to a handy sliding interface that operates similarly to a camera dial. This gesture also reveals a clean preview of the scene you'r [...]<br>

<p id="EkLaRj">Amazon Prime Day is one of the biggest shopping events of the year outside of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, with this year’s autumnal incarnation (once again dubbed Prime Big Deal Days) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/17/24244180/amazon-october-prime-day-big-deal-days-fall-dates-2024">running from October 8th through the 9th.</a> The two-day shopping affair will likely grant Prime members access to some of the best prices of the year on Amazon devices, as well as products from Sony, Sonos, Peloton, Withings, and other well-known brands. This applies to items spanning a range of categories, including gaming peripherals, laptops, 4K TVs, phones, PC accessories, and more. </p>
