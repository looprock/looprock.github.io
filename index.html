Sources familiar with the matter speaking to the <em>Korea Herald</em> claim that LG Display is set to initiate OLED production for the new ‌iPad Pro‌ as early as February next year at their facility in Paju, Gyeonggi Province – a time frame around three months sooner than previously expected.

Yuryev decided to perform several real-world tests on two 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro models, one with 8GB and the other upgraded to 16GB of u [...]<br>
