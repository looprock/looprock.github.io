            Apple recently refreshed the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, adding a new M5 chip for improved performance. There aren't design changes, but Apple did introduce a new Dual Knit Band that's supposed to be more comfortable. <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera picked up one of the new Vision Pro headsets to see how it compares to the prior-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> versions.

            Apple's iPhone development roadmap runs several years into the future and the company is continually working with suppliers on several successive iPhone models at the same time, which is why we often get rumored features months ahead of launch. The iPhone 18 series is no different, and we already have a good idea of what to expect for the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max.

<br/>
One thing worth noting is that Apple is reportedly planning a major change to its iPhone release cycle next year, adopting a two-phase rollout starting with the iPhone 18 series. That means the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and iPhone Fold will be released in September 2026, followed by the iPhone 18 and iPhone 18e in spring 2027.

Those ten companies together account for €49 million of digital-industry lobbying out of a total €151 million recorded in the EU Transparency Register for 2025. Apple previously disclosed spending between €3.5 million and €3.75 million per year in 2021, revealing a near-doubling of declared expenditure within four years.

Apple is working on a next-generation version of the iPad mini (codename J510/J511) that features the A19 Pro chip, according to information found in code that Apple mistakenly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/ipad-mini-a19-pro-chip/">shared</a> in August.

Apple's A19 Pro chip since debuted in the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro models. The iPhone 17 Pro models include the higher-end version of Apple's A19 Pro chip with a 6-core CPU and a 6-core GPU, while the iPhone Air uses a mid-tier A19 Pro chip with one fewer GPU core tha [...]<br>

            IPv4 scarcity drives widespread use of Carrier-Grade Network Address Translation, a practice in ISPs and mobile networks that places many users behind each IP address, along with their collected activity and volumes of traffic.

            Many products at Cloudflare aren’t possible without pushing the limits of network hardware and software to deliver improved performance, increased efficiency, or novel capabilities such as soft-unicast, our method for sharing IP subnets across data centers. Happily, most people do not need to know the intricacies of how your operating system handles network and Internet access in general. Yes, even most people within Cloudflare. But sometimes we try to push well beyond the design intentions of Linux’s networking stack. This is a story about one of those attempts.<br>
