            The Phone app doesn't often get a lot of attention with iOS updates, but that's changing in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>. There are multiple new features to prevent unwanted calls and to save you time.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            We're on the fourth developer beta and first public beta of macOS Tahoe, which means we're getting closer to the launch version that's set to come out in September. With macOS Tahoe now available to the public, we thought it would be a good time to share an initial review of the update.

Like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, macOS Tahoe adopts the Liquid Glass design. It's used for the Dock, widgets, Control Center, menu bars, navigation bars in apps, app icons, and a few other places, but its implementation is less widespread than it is in iOS and iPadOS. It's clear that Liquid Glass was not a Mac-first design, and the glass parts of the interface feel cobbled together with the previous design language.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-01 15:40:23-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            CalDigit recently came out with the TS5 Plus, which is designed to work with Apple's Thunderbolt 5 Macs.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012987" height="1216" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/caldigit-ts5-plus.jpg" width="2162"/>
<br/>
The TS5 Plus looks like CalDigit's prior docks, featuring a simple rectangular shape and an aluminum build with some ridging at the top, bottom, and sides for visual interest and heat dissipation.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a black aluminum color that matches the Space Black of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macbook-pro/">M4 MacBook Pro</a> models, and it comes with a hefty 330W power brick. In fact, the power brick is longer than the dock itself, but it's flat and tucks away under a desk fairly well. The TS5 Plus is six inches long, five inches wide, and 1.8 inches thick, while the power brick is seven inches long, 3.5 inches wide, and a little under an inch thick.

            Apple now considers second-generation Apple Watch Series 1 models released in 2016 to be obsolete, according to the company's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102772">vintage and obsolete products list</a>.

Apple updated the list to move the Series 1 Apple Watch models from the vintage section to the obsolete section, as it has now been more than seven years since the devices were last offered for sale. The Series 1 models were sold alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-2/">Apple Watch Series 2</a> models, and were the successor to the original Apple Watch models.

            In iOS 26, currently in beta, your iPhone gains a handy new charging feature that takes the guesswork out of knowing when your device will be fully powered up. Instead of waiting around or checking your battery percentage every few minutes, you can now see exactly how much time remains until your device reaches 100%.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-971681" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/iPhone-16-Battery-Life-Feature.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
A real-time estimate appears right in your Battery settings while your iPhone is plugged in, making it ideal for planning your day around charging cycles or working out if you have enough time for a quick top-up before heading out.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Check Remaining Charge Time</h2>
<br/>
The process is pretty straightforward once you know where to look:
<br/>
<ol>
<br/>
<li><strong>Open Settings</strong> on your iPhone.</li>
<br/>
<li><strong>Tap Battery</strong>.</li>

Steve Jobs served as Apple's CEO across two distinct stretches: first as interim CEO from September 16, 1997 to January 5, 2000, a period lasting 841 days, and then as official CEO from January 5, 2000 until his resignation on August 24, 2011, a span of 4,249 days.
