            In 2023, Apple didn't make any updates to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> lineup, and it's been even longer since the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> was refreshed. Apple last unveiled a new ‌iPad Air‌ in March 2022, so we're at the two-year mark and it's overdue for an update. Luckily, rumors suggest that we're going to get new iPads as soon as March, and there are exciting changes in store for the Air lineup.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-02-26 14:27:21-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Netflix subscribers who still pay their monthly fees through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> in-app purchase system will soon need to add a new payment method to keep their accounts active, Netflix is telling customers.

<br/>
Though Netflix stopped allowing customers to subscribe to its streaming service on iOS devices <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/12/28/netflix-no-more-itunes-billing-options/">way back in 2018</a>, it has allowed customers that were already subscribed that way to continue using in-app purchase to pay. Payment through Apple's platform is set to stop, however, because Netflix does not want to continue to pay Apple a 15 percent cut of those subscription fees.

Following the release of the second beta version of iOS 17.4, it emerged that Apple had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/ios-17-4-nerfs-web-apps-in-the-eu/">restricted the functionality of iOS web apps in the EU</a>. Web apps can no longer launch from the ‌Home Screen‌ in their own top-level window that takes up the entire screen, relegating them to a simple shortcut with an option to open within Safari instead.

            Starting at $3,500, Apple's Vision Pro price puts it at the top-end of the AR/VR headset market, but a significant portion of the cost is down to the device's premium "bill of materials," which is thought to come in at just over $1,500.

The most expensive component is said to be the two 1.25-inch micro-OLED displays inside the headset, one for each eye. The displays provide a total of 23 million pixels, which Apple says is "more pixels than a 4K TV." Omdia estimates that Apple pays $228 for each display, or $456 per headset.
