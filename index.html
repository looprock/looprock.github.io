            Apple today released the fifth beta of the upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> update to developers for testing purposes, and the Cupertino company continues to make small tweaks and refinements to the operating system.

Like Nomad's other Sport Band options, the Glow in the Dark model is made from FKM fluoroelastomer rubber, and it is waterproof, so it can be worn when swimming, in the ocean, and during sweaty activities. The material is stiffer than Apple's version of the Sport Band, but it is comfortable on the wrist.

There's a pin-and-tuck mechanism to close the band for a secure closure, and interior ventilation channels add breathability to keep the watch band from getting too moist underneath, similar to Apple's Nike bands. In our testing, the Sport Band does in [...]<br>
