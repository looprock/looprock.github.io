The iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max are all equipped with a new "Camera Control" button that allows you to quickly launch the camera, take a photo, start video recording, and more.

<p id="IqlY5X">Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will meet on the presidential debate stage for the first time on Tuesday night. </p>
<p id="tLqtZz">Though it’s technically the second presidential debate of the general election, it’s the first since Harris became the Democratic nominee, replacing President Joe Biden as the party’s candidate. That happened after Biden’s disastrous debate exacerbated concerns about his age, leading to a fracturing of support in the party and his eventual decision to step down and endorse his VP for the top of the ticket.</p>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-09-09 17:09:07-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Though pre-launch Apple Watch rumors suggested that Apple would update its entire Apple Watch lineup this year, Apple ended up focusing primarily on the Apple Watch Series 10. We didn't get a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> or a new Apple Watch Ultra 3, with Apple only adding a new color option for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>.

<br/>
As late as last Friday, rumors pointed toward refreshes for the standard Apple Watch, the ‌Apple Watch SE‌, and the Apple Watch Ultra. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-06/apple-sept-9-event-preview-iphone-16-apple-intelligence-airpods-and-watches"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, for example, said in his Friday "Everything to Expect" article th [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple is adding a new option that will let you pause a video in the middle of a recording, providing an option for capturing multiple shots in a single video rather than having to start and stop new videos each time.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964755" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ios-18-pause-video-button.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
When you start a video in ‌iOS 18‌, you'll see a new pause button on the left side. Pressing it pauses the video, and pressing the button again unpauses. You can still stop a video at any time using the middle stop button.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple added the new video pausing feature in the ‌iOS 18‌ release candidate that was provided to developers and public beta testers today.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            There are no major differentiating features between the two Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models this year, with Apple aiming for feature parity between the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964745" height="1009" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-pro-models-1.jpg" width="1794"/>
<br/>
Last year, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max was updated with a 5x Telephoto lens that used Tetraprism technology, but the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ was limited to 3x zoom. This year, Apple has made improvements that allow both models to offer the 5x Telephoto lens.
<br/>
<br/>
Some pre-launch ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ rumors suggested that Apple might introduce <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/21/iphone-16-pro-dual-48mp-cameras/">a new camera sensor</a> t [...]<br>

Apple did not mention JPEG-XL support during today's event, but this feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/22/iphone-16-lineup-wave-of-camera-improvements/">was rumored</a> ahead of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> launch.

            Apple began transitioning to USB-C instead of Lightning with the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup, and USB-C is also used for charging for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models.
