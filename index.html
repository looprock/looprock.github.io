A user known as "UnclePan" on Chinese social media platform Weibo this week <a href="https://weibo.com/5367283758/PCIUckade">shared an image</a> of third-party MagSafe cases that are apparently for the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max.

On the iPhone 17 Pro cases, the MagSafe layout has changed slightly, with the magnets no longer forming a complete circle on those devices.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Apple did prototype a version of the current iMac with an Apple logo in the "chin" area, according to a post on X today <a href="https://twitter.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/1949849046937747857">from a user known as Kosutami</a>.

The tipster claimed to be familiar with an iPhone 17 Pro commercial that is allegedly being produced by a film company that has publicly listed Apple as one of its clients. <em>MacRumors</em> has not independently confirmed any of the information shared by the tipster, so skepticism is obviously warranted for now.

The tipster revealed three alleged iPhone 17 Pro features that have not been rumored previously:<ul><li>An upgraded Telephoto lens with up to <strong>8× optical zoom</strong>, compared to up to 5× optical zoom on the iPhone 16 Pro models. The lens can apparently move, allowing for continuous optical zoom at various focal lengths.</li></ul> [...]<br>
