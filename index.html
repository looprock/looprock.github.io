<br/>
The change was first spotted by users on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chromecast/comments/1ox7in3/rant_netflix_no_long_has_casting_support_you_must/">Reddit</a> and confirmed in an updated <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/58351">Netflix support page</a> (via <em><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/netflix-casting-chromecast-google-tv-streamer-3620784/">Android Authority</a></em>), which now states that the streaming service no longer supports casting from mobile devices to most TVs and TV-streaming devices. Users are instead directed to use the remote that came with their TV hardware and use its native Netflix app.

            The updated specs of the M5 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> may point toward a major new feature for Apple's next-generation Studio Display expected in early 2026.

<br/>
Apple's latest ‌iPad Pro‌ debuted last month and contains one display-related change that stands out: it can now drive external monitors at up to 120Hz with Adaptive Sync. The feature should deliver lower latency, smoother motion, and fewer visual artifacts during workflows such as gaming and video editing, with Adaptive Sync further minimizing latency for rapid-response tasks.

<br/>
This is the first time an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> has supported 120Hz output to an external monitor and the timing aligns closely with Apple's development of a next-generation Studio Dis [...]<br>

OpenAI's free ChatGPT app for iPhone lets you interact with the chatbot using text or voice. What's more, if you assign voice mode directly to the Action button, you can use it to jump straight into a spoken conversation, giving you quick, handsfree access to a far more capable assistant.

Apple was the top-selling smartphone brand throughout this year's month-long Singles Day period in China, accounting for 26% of all smartphone sales, according to a new report from Counterpoint Research shared by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/apple-single-handedly-drives-singles-day-smartphone-sales-growth-2025-11-27/"><em>Reuters</em></a>.

<p>I’m guessing part of the reason is that <a href="https://x.com/SethBurn/status/1993549909388316845">the incumbent gate-keepers hate AI</a>.

Bill has been heavily involved with this "8th wonder of the modern world" for two decades and even built a career on it, founding Beutler Ink –a digital agency known for its pioneering work in Wikipedia public relations.

We discuss: the official (and not so official) rules, the editor cabal (which isn't one), the business model (which really isn't one), how an edit sticks (or not), how AI chatbots threaten the future of the site (or don't), and a whole lot more.<br>
