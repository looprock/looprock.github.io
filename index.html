            Apple is facing calls to remove its AI-powered notification summaries feature after it generated false headlines about a high-profile murder case, drawing criticism from a major journalism organization.

<br/>
<br/>
Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has urged Apple to disable the Apple Intelligence notification feature, which rolled out globally last week as part of its iOS 18.2 software update. The request comes after the feature created a misleading headline suggesting that murder suspect Luigi Mangione had shot himself, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd0elzk24dno">incorrectly attributing the false information to BBC News</a>.

Apple began integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT into its devices globally <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/apple-releases-ios-18-2-update/">earlier this month</a> with the release of iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2, but ChatGPT is not accessible in China due to regulatory restrictions.

            OpenAI today announced support for a new phone-based ChatGPT experience, which can be accessed by calling or texting 1-800-ChatGPT (1-800-242-8478). The feature was introduced as part of OpenAI's ongoing 12 days of OpenAI event.

The 1-800-ChatGPT phone number is designed for situations where a data connection is unavailable, but a cellular connection works.

Priced at $20, TimeCapsule is an ‌AirTag‌ enclosure that houses two AA batteries that offer 14x more battery capacity than the CR2032 battery that the ‌AirTag‌ runs on.
