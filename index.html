            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iPhone development roadmap runs several years into the future and the company is continually working with suppliers on several successive iPhone models at the same time, which is why we often get rumored features months ahead of launch. The iPhone 18 series is no different, and we already have a good idea of what to expect for the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1018297" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/iPhone-17-Pro-Cosmic-Orange.jpg" width="1960"/>
<br/>
One thing worth noting is that Apple is reportedly planning a major change to its iPhone release cycle next year, adopting a two-phase rollout starting with the iPhone 18 series. That means the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and iPhone Fold will be released in September 2026, followed by the iPhone 18 and iPhone 18e in spring 2027.

            <p>Everyone needs to stop thinking about enterprise AI as a way to fire people and think about how to use AI to make people more productive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/29/forrester_ai_rehiring/">Forresterâs analysis</a> found that using AI for financially driven layoffs can backfire: 55 percent of employers regret laying off workers because of AI. More people in charge of AI investment expect it to increase headcount (57 percent) than to decrease it (15 percent) over the next year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Either that, or start by replacing the executives with an AI. A more retention friendly alternate would be to give staff a month long sabbatical and require executives to only use AIs for a month. If they wanted to be really 9-9-6, make that quarter sabbatical .</p>

Apple is identified by the report as one of the ten largest tech-sector lobby spenders in Europe. Those ten companies together account for â¬49 million of digital-industry lobbying out of a total â¬151 million recorded in the EU Transparency Register for 2025. Apple previously disclosed spending between â¬3.5 million and â¬3.75 million per year in 2021, revealing a near-doubling of declared expenditure within four years.

<br/>
Apple is working on a next-generation version of the iPad mini (codename J510/J511) that features the A19 Pro chip, according to information found in code that Apple mistakenly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/ipad-mini-a19-pro-chip/">shared</a> in August.

            Apple researchers have released <a href="https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19808">Pico-Banana-400K</a>, a comprehensive dataset of 400,000 curated images that's been specifically designed to improve how AI systems edit photos based on text prompts.

The massive dataset aims to address what Apple describes as a gap in current AI image editing training. While systems like GPT-4o can make impressive edits, the researchers say progress has been limited by inadequate training data built from real photographs. Apple's new dataset aims to improve the situation.

Pico-Banana-400K features images organized into 35 different edit types across eight categories, from basic adjustments like color changes to complex transformations such as converting people into Pixar-style characters or LEGO figures. Each image went throu [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Samsung has been working on a smartphone with not just one fold, but two, and the first photos of the upcoming device surfaced today (via <em><a href="https://www.chosun.com/economy/tech_it/2025/10/28/ESKL75Q5QJESLKTFUZRR4RWQRI/">The Chosun Daily</a></em>).

<br/>
Samsung displayed the tri-fold smartphone at APEC 2025 Korea. The device is designed to transform from a ~6.5-inch smartphone into a ~10-inch tablet-style display. It will fold twice, rather than just once like the standard Galaxy Fold smartphones.

<br/>
There was no opportunity for APEC attendees to try the smartphone because it was displayed in a transparent case, but <em><a href="https://www.kedglobal.com/tech,-media-telecom/newsView/ked202510280009">The Korea Economic Daily</a></em>  [...]<br>

Apple created a new speaker system for the âiPad miniâ that uses vibration-based technology, allowing for the speaker holes in the device to be removed. Removing the speaker holes would cut down on areas where water could get into the crevices of the âiPad miniâ.
