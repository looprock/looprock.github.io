            The next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a> won't include Apple's new N1 networking chip, according to code analysis provided by a <em>MacRumors</em> tipster.

<br/>
A macOS kernel debug kit distributed by Apple earlier this year included information on a number of upcoming devices, including the ‌HomePod mini‌ 2. Code associated with the ‌HomePod mini‌ 2 mentions the "Sunrise" wireless system, which is what Apple calls Bluetooth/Wi-Fi chips sourced from MediaTek. The N1 is called "Centauri" in Apple's internal systems.

<br/>
Based on the Sunrise mention, it appears that the ‌HomePod mini‌ 2 won't be upgraded with the N1 networking chip, which contradicts some prior rumors we've heard about it. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s  [...]<br>

            Apple's next-generation iPad mini will be equipped with an A20 Pro chip, according to a <em>MacRumors</em> tipster who analyzed a macOS kernel debug kit containing internal Apple codenames. The kit was accidentally released on Apple's website earlier this year, but it was quickly pulled after information started leaking out of it.

Earlier this year, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/">said</a> the foldable iPhone would have a 7.8-inch inner display, and a 5.5-inch outer display, so the sizes shared in today's report are slightly smaller.

These details came from a version of a Kernel Debut Kit for macOS that was not supposed to be released to the public — it was later pulled by Apple.

For the ‌iPhone‌ 17e, the code showed the device may be equipped with either the C1 or C1X modem, but no N1 wireless chip. <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/inside-apples-iphone-road-map-foldable-screens-curved-glass-cases"><em>The Information</em> today reported</a> that the  [...]<br>

The claim centers on an agreement from October 2018, from which point it is alleged that Amazon restricted third-party sellers from offering Apple products on Amazon's marketplace, while Apple gave Amazon better wholesale terms for Apple products sold directly by Amazon as a retailer.

As a result of these changes, the report said the iPhone 18 Pro models will not have a pill-shaped Dynamic Island cutout at the top of the screen.

<br/>
In its latest projection for the smartphone market next year, the firm has downgraded its forecast from a previously expected 0.45% growth, citing a memory shortage that has pushed component costs up 10% to 25%. Chinese brands like Honor and Oppo are said to face greater pressure due to lower profit margins, particularly in the entry-level segment where costs have jumped 20% to 30% since early 2025.

The Weibo-based account claims Apple is adopting this strategy – foldable first, 20th anniversary iPhone second – to gauge consumer reaction to the under-screen camera, where the lens is literally concealed behind the panel with no visible cutouts in the display.

Apple's foldable is also understood to be utilizing side-button integrated Touch ID over Face ID for biometric authentication due to internal space constraints. This means the "iPhone Fold" will have the first all-screen display of any Apple device – a d [...]<br>

<br/>
In some cases, it's obvious what the feature flags are referring to, while some are more vague and harder to interpret. We've included the feature flag and a short explanation of what it might reference, but keep in mind that Apple doesn't provide full explanations because this is all internal code. We're working off of titles and internal organization, but there are still hints of what may be coming in the future.

The garbage collector quietly does its job, and unlike C or C++, we rarely think about malloc or free. This doesn’t mean that there are no memory leaks in Python.

You might not notice it at first, until your worker starts OOM-ing, latency creeps up, or container restarts become mysteriously frequent.</p><p>In this post, we’ll share the story of a real-world memory leak we encountered during a Python upgrade — how we discovered it, the tools and techniques we used to investigate, and the lessons we learned.</p><h3>What happened after upgrading to Python 3.10?</h3> [...]<br>

<blockquote>
<p>This capability allows for seamless task completion, such as linking internal ticketing systems directly through to code commitment, significantly reducing the time required for ticket resolution. Specifically, developers can utilize natural language processing to direct an AI agent to find their next task, have the AI coding assistant implement the requested changes, and automatically submit a pull request. While this process introduced complexity by layering authorization, the resulting gains in speed and efficiency are highly transformational.</p>

<p>Heroku and early cloud worked because they <em>removed</em> friction: no tickets, no permission, no approved stack. Developers could move fast, make local tradeoffs, and live with the consequences.</p>
<p>Enterprise adoption usually means re-introducing the friction the tech was designed to eliminate. It&rsquo;s called maturity. It feels like regression.</p>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-12-15 10:18:03+01:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Eventually, software is very hard to change. There are numerous reasons for this, and they often don’t even involve the software. The systems that run the software are old, regulators don’t let you change things, security controls, people have just forgotten how to program COBOL. There is so much code that it’s hard to know what the code does.</p>
<p>So when you want to change it, you don’t know what to do. The ultimate sign of legacy software is that you don’t know how to test it after making changes. If you can’t test software, you can’t safely make changes, the Michael Feathers definition of legacy code.</p>
<p>I could get distracted by discussing the reasons, but we all know that <a href="https://cote.io/legacytrap/">software just becomes “legacy” at some point</a>.</p>
<p>This means that you have to figure out building software that will be valuable in the long-term before the software calcifies. Early on you can change things, more or less at will</p> [...]<br>
