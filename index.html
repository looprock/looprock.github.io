<br/>
Apple's first-ever mixed reality headset offers both augmented and virtual reality features, and it is controlled with a combination of your eyes, hands, and voice. Apple describes the device as a "spatial computer" instead of a headset.
<br/>
<br/>
"The era of spatial computing has arrived," said Apple CEO Tim Cook. "Apple Vision Pro is the most advanced consumer electronics device ever created. Its revolutionary and magical user interface will redefine how we connect, create, and explore."

Speaking to investors on Thursday during Meta's Q4 earnings call, Zuckerberg called Apple's new rules "so onerous" that he would not be surprised if any developer adopted them.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is considering launching its first foldable in the next few years in the form of a 7- to 8-inch device that could ultimately replace the 8.3-inch iPad mini.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934078" height="1265" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/FoldPad-Redux-24-Magenta-and-Blue.jpg" width="2250"/>
<br/>
That's the latest claim to come out of Korean outlet <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=25724">The Elec</a></em>. According to the report, Apple is reviewing a launch timeframe for the device between 2026 and 2027.
<br/>
<br/>
However, Apple is also actively developing an OLED iPad mini, so there remains uncertainty within Apple about the nature and specifications of the foldable. Speculation reportedly remains rife in the industry around whether it will be a foldable iPhone or foldable iPad model.
