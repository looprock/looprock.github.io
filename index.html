            <b>Published:</b> 2024-09-16 11:40:49-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has seemingly leaked the rumored next-generation Mac mini with five USB-C ports, according to a code change within Apple software that was discovered today <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1835739463751782807">by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris</a>.

<br/>
The code refers to an unreleased Mac mini model with an Apple silicon chip and five ports, which lines up with a previous report from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman that said the next Mac mini <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/02/new-m4-mac-mini-5-usb-c-ports/">will be equipped with five USB-C ports</a>. Similar to the Mac Studio, Gurman said two of the ports will be located on the front of the new Mac mini. Technically speaking, at least some of these ports will likely be Thunderbolt 4 ports, which use the USB-C connector design.
