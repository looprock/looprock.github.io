            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Samsung is considering introducing a new premium smartphone brand that would exist alongside or even replace its iconic "Galaxy" branding, according to Korean publication <em><a href="https://www.etoday.co.kr/news/view/2413937">E-Today</a></em>.
<br/>

<br/>
The potential rebranding initiative reportedly aims to differentiate Samsung's high-end devices from its budget offerings. Currently, the company's broad use of "Galaxy" spans from entry-level Galaxy A and M series phones priced around $100-200 to premium Galaxy S flagships and Galaxy Z foldables that can cost upwards of $1,800.
<br/>
<br/>
Industry analysts suggest the wide price range under a single brand may dilute the premium perception of Samsung's high-end devices. The belief is that when consumers associate the Galaxy name with budget-friendly options, it becomes mo [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has reportedly designed a new AI-based system that will summarize reviews in the App Store to highlight the most common customer feedback for users before they download an app.
<br/>

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-876046" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/app-store-awards-2022.jpg" width="1600"/>

According an unlisted App Store article seen by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/10/29/app-store-summary-app-reviews/">9to5Mac</a></em>, AI-generated summaries will appear on app product pages alongside existing elements like descriptions and screenshots.
