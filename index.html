In 1976, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak co-founded Apple Computer Company to market Wozniak's Apple I, a pioneering personal computer. Their collaboration led to the introduction of the Apple II in 1977, which significantly influenced the personal computing industry.

<br/>
In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, notable for its graphical user interface and the iconic "1984" Super Bowl commercial directed by Ridley Scott. However, internal conflicts led to Jobs' departure from Apple in 1985. He then founded NeXT Inc., focusing on advanced computer platforms.

<br/>
As we noted in our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/everything-new-ios-18-4-beta-1/">list of iOS 18.4 features</a>, CarPlay now shows a third row of icons, up from two rows previously. However, this change is only visible in vehicles with a larger center display. For example, a MacRumors Forums member <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-4-beta-1-bug-fixes-changes-and-improvements.2449908/post-33753569">noticed the change</a> in a Toyota Tundra, which can be equipped with up to a 14-inch screen.

In our testing, CarPlay still showed two rows of four icons in a Honda Civic with a 9-inch screen.

When I started focusing on TDE, it was going to require changes to buffer reads/writes, WAL, and require a way to store secret keys.  I thought those changes

            <p>I’d like to thank everyone who’s been reaching out and expressed support for another Monitorama event. Like many of you, I truly enjoy the community and environment we’ve created together, and look forward to each upcoming event with a palpable sense of excitement (and panic).</p><p>Unfortunately, we’re going to take a pause this year. The short story is that things just didn’t click into place like I’d hoped, and rather than deliver a compromised experience, I figure it makes more sense to just step back, regroup, and plan for an even more amazing event in the not-too-distant future.</p><p>If you have any questions or would just like to chat, feel free to connect at <a href="mailto:info@monitorama.com">info@monitorama.com</a> (or in the community Slack if you’re already a member). In the meantime I hope you’ll keep us in mind for 2026.</p><p>Yours truly,<br/>Jason Dixon</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*c8xKg-A0nok_LxUTMfpfmQ.jpeg"/></figure>&lt;img alt="" height="1" sr [...]<br>
