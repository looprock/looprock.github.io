            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1903469694159642784">reiterated</a> that the A20 chip in iPhone 18 models will be manufactured with TSMC's 2nm process.

<br/>
Kuo said TSMC's trial production of 2nm chips has now reached yields well above the 60-70% range. The yield refers to the percentage of functional chips that can be obtained per silicon wafer, which is essentially a large, circular disc of chips.
<br/>
<br/>
Kuo first said that the A20 chip would be 2nm <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/19/kuo-iphone-17-3nm-chips/">around six months ago</a>, and another analyst Jeff Pu <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/iphone-18-a20-chip-2nm-rumor/">said likewise earlier this week</a>.
