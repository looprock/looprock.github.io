            Way back in 2018, we discussed how the Ravinia Festival Association, which operates the Ravinia Festival venue north of Chicago, attempted to shut down or force a rename for the then new Ravinia Brewing Company brewery and restaurant in Highland Park.

iFixit's petition calls attention to some of the "blocks" that manufacturers have put in place that prevent customers and independent repair shops from repairing their electronics, such as proprietary screws or repairs that require software authentication, which is a method that Apple employs. iFixit wants the FTC to consider the following rules:

Peripheral neuropathies are one of the most common diabetic complications, according to Withings, and as of now, are checked for only at annual doctor visits.

Apple is no longer signing iOS 17.1 following the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/apple-releases-ios-17-1-1/">release of iOS 17.1.1</a>, which came out on November 7.

<br/>
It is not unusual that iOS 17.1 is no longer being signed. Apple routinely stops signing older versions of iOS after new releases in order to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date and to prevent users from downgrading to older, less secure versions of the software.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-11-14 07:32:00-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Phone brand Nothing today <a href="https://us.nothing.tech/pages/nothing-chats">announced</a> plans to introduce a new "Nothing Chats" app that features iMessage compatibility later this month.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The app is powered by Sunbird, an unofficial iMessage client that debuted last year with over 10,000 downloads on the Google Play Store. To use the Nothing Chats app with iMessage, users will need to log in with their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a>. The app touts end-to-end encryption in line with Sunbird's privacy policy.
<br/>
<br/>
In a new video, Nothing CEO Carl Pei explained that the app will support individual and group chats, typing indicators, full-size media sharing, and voice notes. Features like read receipts, message reactions, and replies will be added later.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Next year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> could feature a more power-efficient display thanks to a new OLED material set that is reportedly being developed by Samsung specifically for Apple.

<br/>
A material set includes a variety of components for OLED screens, such as capping layers (CPL), which adjust the optical characteristics of the screen. Each component is produced by a specialist manufacturer and supplied to Samsung, which then uses them to construct the final OLED panel. 
<br/>
<br/>
A different composition of materials in the set can alter attributes of the OLED panel, such as lifespan, brightness, color accuracy, or manufacturing efficiency.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When Meta launched Threads in July, one of the complaints users had about the platform was that it was impossible to delete your Threads profile <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/06/deleting-threads-profile-also-deletes-instagram/">without also deleting your Instagram account</a>.

<br/>
Up until now, the only alternative was to "temporarily" deactivate your Threads profile. This option makes your posts and interactions with others invisible on the platform, but it leaves your posts on Meta's servers unless you go through them and manually delete them one by one.

From the violin melody accompanying a pivotal scene to the soaring orchestral arrangement and thunderous sound-effects propelling an edge-of-your-seat action sequence, the various components of the audio soundtrack combine to evoke the very essence of story-telling. To uncover the magic of audio soundtracks and further improve the sonic experience, we need a way to systematically examine the interaction of these components, typically categorized as <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16t8zf9">dialogue, music and effects</a>.</p><p>In this blog </p> [...]<br>
