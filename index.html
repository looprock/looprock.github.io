            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In Safari on iPhone, it's not unusual for the number of tabs you have open to quickly get out of hand. Here's how to temporarily clean things up without losing your tabs.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If you have no use for all your open tabs, you can simply select one, then press and hold on the tabs button in the bottom-right corner of the screen. This will bring up an option to "Close All [x] Tabs," X being the number open.

There’s always this trade-off between building shiny new features and slogging through tech debt to upgrade dependencies. And let’s be honest, new features almost always win. They’re the ones driving business value, after all.</p><p>What if we flipped the script? Imagine upgrading libraries, handling breaking changes, and adopting new features happening seamlessly — without pulling developers away from their real work.

            Apple is preparing to launch a dramatically thinner iPhone this September, and if recent leaks are anything to go by, the so-called iPhone 17 Air could boast one of the most radical design shifts in recent years.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            OpenAI has reversed a recent update to GPT-4o, the model powering ChatGPT, following widespread complaints about the chatbot's strange behavior.

<br/>
Deployed late last week, the update made ChatGPT excessively agreeable and unnaturally effusive in its praise, and the responses quickly became the subject of mockery on social media.
<br/>
<br/>
CEO Sam Altman announced Tuesday that the company had completed the rollback for free users and was working to restore the previous version for paid subscribers. "We're working on additional fixes to model personality and will share more in the coming days," Altman wrote on <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1917291637962858735">X (Twitter)</a>.

            Apple is making another round of leadership changes across two key divisions ahead of its earnings report on Thursday, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-30/apple-aapl-reshuffles-government-affairs-and-music-units-in-latest-changes">Bloomberg</a></em>'s Mark Gurman.

<br/>
The company's Apple Music division will now be co-managed by longtime Apple executive Rachel Newman and former TikTok music veteran Ole Obermann. Both will report to Oliver Schusser, who has taken on additional responsibilities over the past year including Apple TV+ and sports initiatives.
<br/>
<br/>
The restructuring appears designed to ease Schusser's workload as he continues to oversee the Beats brand and international services while reporting to Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of online services.

            Researchers at cybersecurity firm Oligo today outlined a series of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> vulnerabilities that impact millions of Apple devices (<em>via <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/airborne-airplay-flaws/">Wired</a></em>) and accessories that connect to Apple devices.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's Pro Display XDR has now been on the market for over five years, and while persistent rumors hint at a second-generation model, surprisingly little definitive information has emerged about Apple's plans for its premier external monitor. Here's everything we know so far.
