            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-03 14:44:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            ASUS recently came out with a new 32-inch 6K ProArt Display that's priced at $1,399, so we thought we'd check it out to see how it compares with the Studio Display and the Pro Display XDR from Apple.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>
<br/>
At 32 inches, the ProArt 6K is larger than the 27-inch Studio Display, but it is on par in size with the Pro Display XDR. ASUS doesn't have the same design aesthetic as Apple, so the ProArt 6K's design isn't impressive. There's a square-shaped base, an arm that attaches to the display, and thin bezels at the top and the sides. There's a thicker bottom bezel that houses some quick access control buttons.
<br/>
<br/>
ASUS' display has the same 218 pixels per inch as the Pro Display XDR, and text looks crisp. Colors are accurate out of the box and can be further tweaked in the Settings menu with different profiles. HDR [...]<br>

            <p>Every day, shoppers from Etsy's community of nearly 90M buyers visit our marketplace to search for unique, handmade, and vintage items. But with over 100 million listings, how do we help each buyer find exactly what they're looking for? Traditional search and recommendation systems often fall short of capturing the nuanced interests that make each Etsy buyer unique, from specific styles to aesthetic preferences. At Etsy, understanding our buyers' interests is central to delivering engaging, personalized experiences. </p>
<p>Recently, we explored enhancing our personalization by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to create detailed buyer profiles based on buyers’ browsing and purchasing behaviors. We build these profiles in alignment with privacy laws and requirements such as the GDPR and the CCPA/CPRA. Buyers have the ability to opt-out, so that they can choose not to have a profile generated at all.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Astropad today announced the launch of <a href="http://astropad.com/freshcoat">Fresh Coat</a>, a new anti-reflective screen protector that's designed to make the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> easier to see outdoors and under bright lights.

<br/>
Fresh Coat is a glass screen protector that cuts down on up to 75 percent of reflections while preserving color accuracy.
<br/>
<br/>
We were able to try out Fresh Coat ahead of launch, and can confirm that it does indeed cut down on reflections without impacting the ‌iPhone‌'s color or display visibility, with no sign of haze. Astropad includes a tray that ensures a precise alignment and makes applying the screen protector foolproof, and it comes with an app clip that walks you through the installation process.

            Netflix today <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/netflix-moments">announced</a> an update to its Moments feature that lets users save and share favorite scenes as standalone clips, available now in the streaming service's iOS app.

            In iOS 26, currently in beta, Apple Notes has gained new Markdown support, letting you seamlessly import and export files in the popular plain-text formatting language.

For those unfamiliar with Markdown, it's a simple way of writing that uses plain text symbols (like ** for bold or # for headings) to format documents without complicated menus. It's popular because the same text works both as easy-to-read notes and as polished, styled content when exported.
