            Last Friday, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/19/global-it-outage-limited-to-windows-pcs/">a major CrowdStrike outage</a> impacted PCs running Microsoft Windows, causing worldwide issues affecting airlines, retailers, banks, hospitals, rail networks, and more.

<br/>
The failure was caused by an update to the CrowdStrike Falcon antivirus software that auto-installed on Windows 10 PCs, but Mac and Linux machines were not affected even though they received the same software. A report from <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/cybersecurity/microsoft-tech-outage-role-crowdstrike-50917b90">The Wall Street Journal</a></em> delves into what happened and includes some critical information from Microsoft on why Macs did not get taken out by the update.
