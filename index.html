            The popular weather app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather-alerts-radar/id961390574">CARROT Weather</a> today was updated with two key new features: CarPlay support and automatic Live Activities.

<br/>
When accessed via CarPlay, CARROT Weather becomes a navigation app like Google Maps. You can enter your destination and receive turn-by-turn directions, with the added benefit of being able to view the weather along your driving route. The weather features include live radar, severe weather warnings, wind speeds, visibility levels, and more. 
<br/>
<br/>
CARROT Weather's turn-by-turn directions are as snarky as its weather forecasts, so prepare for remarks such as "turn left on Rodeo Drive, meatbag," or "you went the wrong way, idiot, now I have to recalculate your entire route."
