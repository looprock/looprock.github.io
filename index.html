            With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-2-features/">launch of iOS 17.2</a>, Apple added a camera feature that allows <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max models to record 3D spatial video that will be viewable on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> when it becomes available for purchase.

<br/>
To demonstrate the feature, Apple this week invited several members of the media to record spatial video with their iPhones and then view it on an ‌Apple Vision Pro‌ headset. Those who were able to experience their videos in 3D have now written about the experience and what it's like using the Vision Pro for reliving memories.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Philips Hue line has long been focused on lighting products, but this year, Hue parent company Signify expanded the lineup with a set of Philips Hue Secure cameras and sensors designed for home security.

<br/>
I was able to test out the $200 Hue Secure Wired Camera to see how it measures up to some of the other smart camera options on the market.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            TSMC has officially mentioned its work on 1.4nm fabrication technology that is likely destined to underpin future Apple silicon chips.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-924673" height="800" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-silicon-1-feature.jpg" width="1422"/>
<br/>
In a slide (via <em>SemiAnalysis</em>'s <a href="https://x.com/dylan522p/status/1734766944774193291?s=20">Dylan Patel</a>) from its Future of Logic panel, TSMC disclosed the official name of its 1.4nm node for the first time, "A14." The company's 1.4nm technology is expected to follow its "N2" 2nm chips.
<br/>
<br/>
N2 is scheduled for mass production in late 2025, to be followed by an enhanced "N2P" node in late 2026. As a result, it is unlikely that any A14 chips will arrive before 2027.

Apple was the first company to utilize TSMC's 3nm technology with the A17 Pro chip in the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, and the company is likely to follow suit with the chipmaker [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-12-14 05:53:54-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple in iOS 17 added inline predictive text for iPhones, but did not include a way to turn it off independently of predictive suggestions above the keyboard. In the latest iOS 17.2 update, that's changed. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926577" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/inline-predictive-text.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
Apple has improved its machine learning technology on iPhones in an effort to make iOS a lot more helpful, and one of the features in which this tech has been deployed is inline predictive text. 
<br/>
<br/>
Predictive text does just what it says - it predicts what you're going to type next, and offers to autocomplete it. As you type, the predicted text appears ahead of the cursor. If it has accurately predicted what you intend to type, all you need to do is tap the spacebar and iOS fills it in for you.
