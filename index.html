Google says that the new "SGE while browsing" feature is meant to help people "more deeply engage" with long-form content from creators. It shows key points on articles freely available on the web, and will not summarize articles that are paywalled.

            ZAGG today introduced the Pro Stylus 2, which is designed to be an alternative to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>. It comes in a range of fun colors, such as blue, pink, yellow, gray, and white, and it is compatible with all iPads from 2018 and later.

            <p>Grand Theft Auto is one of the most well-known series known for its open-world exploration, complex storytelling, and cutting-edge gameplay. When Rockstar Games, the creator of the GTA series, hinted about a new game, it was not just an announcement but a fundamental change in the gaming industry.

Rockstar Games announced GTA VI's existence in February 2022, stating, "Active development for the next entry in the Grand Theft Auto series is well underway."  It was a masterful act of understatement that set the tone for one of the most anticipated games of the decade.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Off-chain games have been a standard in the gaming industry for many years. However, new opportunities and technologies emerge as time passes, and on-chain games provide a slightly different approach for developers and players. In creating <a href="https://twitter.com/mamkinma">my own game</a>, I discovered many of these nuances.</p>
<p>\
Nowadays, it is challenging to make an in-demand game based purely on blockchain because the speed and responsiveness of the game are often crucial for a pleasant <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/gaming">gaming</a> experience, and the speed of blockchain networks is not enough to provide such an experience. Therefore, my game can be called a hybrid game: for things where speed is required, the classical approach is used, and for things related to economics and statistics (player parameters, their level, and so on), the on-chain component is used.</p>

            <p>As per Twilio's 2023 report, about 92% of companies are leveraging AI-powered personalization. Even amid the economic downturn, 69% of business leaders plan to increase their investments in personalization initiatives.</p>
<p>\
This inclination towards tailoring user experiences isn't merely a byproduct of technological maturity. It's, in fact, deeply intertwined with what users prefer and how costly it can be for businesses not to suffice these preferences.</p>
<p>\
For example, McKinsey outlines that 71% of consumers expect personalization, and 76% get frustrated when the experiences are not tailored to them. The consulting giant further stresses that "loyalty is up for grabs" and that non-personalized communications are a risky endeavor "in a low-loyalty environment."</p>

            Stacking is a three-dimensional conceptualization of web pages, where an imaginary z-axis runs perpendicular to the screen. On the xy plane elements can overlap and the browser needs to figure out which one should be on top. There are three types of elements to consider when it comes to the default stacking order: the root, non-positioned, and positioned elements. The root element goes at the bottom of this imaginary stack, then the non-positioned elements, and finally the positioned elements.<br>

<h2>Wi-Fi 7</h2>
<br/>
Wi-Fi 7 devices will be able to send and receive data over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously, resulting in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. With technologies such as 4K QAM, Wi-Fi 7 is expected to offer peak data transfer speeds of over 40 Gbps, a 4× increase over Wi-Fi 6E.
