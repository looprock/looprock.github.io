Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/specs/">tech specs page for the AirPods Pro 3</a> confirms the USB-C charging cable is sold separately.

<br/>
Apple previewed the Jupiter environment for WWDC attendees in June, but this is the first time that Vision Pro owners have been able to try it out for themselves in the comfort of their own home.
<br/>
<br/>
In visionOS 26, the Morning Light environment has made way for Jupiter, which needs to be downloaded first to experience it. 
<br/>
<br/>
Jupiter is the fastest rotating planet in our solar system, with a day that is only 10 hours long, and Apple gives you a taste of it thanks to a new "Explore Jupiter" option that makes this Environment more interactive than others.

            When Apple previewed watchOS 26 in June at WWDC, the company didn't reveal any new watch faces, but now we know Apple was just holding them back to show off with the new Apple Watch models that it unveiled on Tuesday.

During its "Awe dropping" event, Apple also dropped the release candidate of watchOS 26. As it turns out, there are four new watch faces included in the upcoming update, some of which you may have already seen adorning the Apple Watch Series 11 and Apple Watch Ultra 3.
<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple's release notes, they are as follows:<blockquote><ul>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has added a "groundbreaking" new memory security feature to its new iPhone 17 lineup called Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE), which the company describes as "the most significant upgrade to memory safety in the history of consumer operating systems."

<br/>
The new security feature targets spyware tools like Pegasus that exploit vulnerabilities to hack targeted devices. According to Apple, MIE provides comprehensive, always-on memory-safety protection covering the kernel and over 70 userland processes, built on the Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE).

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Spotify has officially rolled out lossless audio streaming to Premium subscribers after years of delays. The feature, which was first promised in 2021, is gradually becoming available in 50 markets including the US, UK, Australia, and Germany.

<br/>
Thankfully, Spotify includes lossless streaming at no additional cost for existing Premium members.

ProRes RAW captures unprocessed data straight from the camera sensor, giving editors more flexibility when color grading and adjusting footage later. The format also takes up less storage space than other RAW video formats while maintaining quality.
