            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Social network X, previously known as Twitter, may soon offer more than one subscription tier. Code in the app suggests that the Premium offering could be split into three, including Premium Basic, Premium Standard, and Premium Plus.

<br/>
Premium Basic lists "full ads" in the For You feed, while Premium Standard says it has "half ads" in For You. Premium Plus says there will be no ads in For You. Given the specific mention of the For You feed, it sounds like all of the tiers will continue to have ads in replies. Revenue from reply ads is used for paying content creators on the social network.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Having delivered my <a class="major" href="https://momjian.us/main/presentations/sql.html#nulls" style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Nulls Make Things Easier?</em></a> talk at <a class="txt2html" href="https://momjian.us/main/events/2023.html#October_3-5_2023" style="text-decoration: none;">PGConf NYC</a> this week, I
found two ways to improve the talk.  First, in researching my <a class="txt2html" href="https://momjian.us/main/presentations/performance.html#beyond" style="text-decoration: none;"><em>Beyond Joins and Indexes</em></a> talk, I was reminded
(<a class="txt2html" href="https://momjian.us/main/writings/pgsql/beyond.pdf#page=65" style="text-decoration: none;">slide 65</a>) of the difference in NULL handling between NOT IN and NOT EXISTS.  I realized this information should
be my nulls talk, so I added <a class="txt2html" href="https://momjian.us/main/writings/pgsql/nulls.pdf#page=25" style="text-decoration: none;">slide 25</a> to cover this.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> was introduced in March last year, adding the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip, Center Stage on the front-facing camera, a faster USB-C port, and several new color options, but it was still a fairly minor upgrade over the previous model from September 2020. As we near a year and a half since the fifth-generation ‌iPad Air‌ was introduced, what can users expect from the sixth-generation model and when will it launch?

<br/>
As of 2023, it has been some time since the ‌iPad Air‌ had a major hardware refresh. Yet due to its positioning between the entry-level <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, it is not immediately  [...]<br>
