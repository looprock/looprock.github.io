            <b>Published:</b> 2025-04-23 07:57:09-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If you're a Mac user with a Windows PC background, you'll probably know how to use the typical copy and paste commands in macOS. But there's a handy clipboard trick that's worth keeping in mind.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-999495" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/copy-paste-shortcut.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
In Windows, the Copy and Paste key combinations are <strong>Control-C</strong> and <strong>Control-V</strong>, respectively. On the Mac, it's very similar – all you do is use the <strong>Command (⌘)</strong> key instead of Control. 
<br/>
<br/>
But did you know that you can also paste text without its original formatting? Not knowing that this is possible on a Mac, many users paste text into a plain-format text editor to strip it of any styling before copying and pasting it again to its intended destination. But you don't have to do that.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Netflix recreated an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> from the ground up for its newly released thriller "iHostage," a dramatization of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/22/apple-store-amsterdam-robbery/">real-life hostage crisis</a> that took place at Apple's Leidseplein retail store in Amsterdam in 2022.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Since filming inside an actual ‌Apple Store‌ was not possible, Netflix and the production team behind "iHostage" reconstructed a full-scale replica of the Amsterdam location. The recreation was designed to match the original ‌Apple Store‌'s layout and architecture, using advanced virtual production techniques to replicate the store's surrounding environment. 
<br/>
<br/>
To build the replica, the production team constructed the interior set on a soundstage, surrounded by a high-resolution LED wall. This display allowed the filmmakers to render a photorealistic virtual version of th [...]<br>

            xAI has launched a new Voice Mode for its Grok chatbot, introducing a feature called Grok Vision that lets users interact with the world through their smartphone camera. Much like ChatGPT and Google Gemini, Grok can now interpret what your phone sees and respond in real time.

Using Grok Vision, iPhone users can point their camera at an object and ask "What am I looking at?" – and the chatbot will reply aloud with a context-aware response. The feature is now available on the Grok iOS app, but Android users will need to wait a little longer for access.

In addition to visual recognition, Voice Mode now supports multilingual audio, allowing users to converse with Grok in multiple languages. Real-time search is also integrated, giving the chatbot the ability to provide instant answers that reflect the latest information. [...]<br>

            The narrative during Trump&#8217;s first term is that he was going after the &#8220;worst of the worst&#8221; undocumented immigrants. But ICE and other DHS components ran out of actual dangerous criminals pretty quickly, largely because immigrants tend to be more law-abiding than regular US citizens. Trump&#8217;s return to office came coupled with promises to deport [&#8230;]<br>

            Apple plans to release an all-new super thin <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> this year, debuting it alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, and ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max.

The ‌iPhone 17 Air‌ is expected to be around 5.5mm thick (with a thicker camera bar area), making it the thinnest ‌iPhone‌ to date. With the ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ models rumored to be around 8.725mm thick, there will be a notable difference between the ‌iPhone 17 Air‌ and the rest of the ‌iPhone 17‌ models.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple Intelligence features are no longer marketed as being "available now," following a U.S. National Advertising Division (NAD) inquiry.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple devices support a relatively unknown three-finger gesture that lets you share a photo across your devices in super-quick time. It's a neat trick to fall back on if AirDrop is playing up or your iCloud Photos are taking ages to sync.

<br/>
Universal Clipboard is usually associated with copying and pasting text, but by using this gesture, you can make it work really well for sharing images between your devices too.

<br/>
It can be used to quickly copy images across nearby devices for pasting into Messages, Notes, emails, Pages, and other apps with input fields.

For the following steps to work, you'll need to have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned on and your devices signed into the same Apple Account and connected to the same network.
