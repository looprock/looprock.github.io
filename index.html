            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            OpenAI says it has uncovered evidence that Chinese AI startup DeepSeek used its proprietary models to train a competing open-source model, potentially violating the company's terms of service.

<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-987615" height="3030" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/deepseek-ai-app.jpg" width="5386"/>
<br/>
The discovery centers around a technique called "distillation," where developers use outputs from larger AI models to train smaller ones. The practice is common in AI development, but OpenAI claims DeepSeek crossed a line by using it to build a rival model.
<br/>
<br/>
"The issue is when you take it out of the platform and are doing it to create your own model for your own purposes," a source close to OpenAI told the <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a0dfedd1-5255-4fa9-8ccc-1fe01de87ea6">Financial Times</a></em>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WhatsApp has released version 25.2.3 for iOS devices to patch a significant privacy vulnerability that affected its "View Once" feature. The bug allowed users to access photos and videos that were meant to disappear after a single viewing.

<br/>
The security flaw, which only impacted iPhone users, allowed anyone to view supposedly ephemeral content by navigating to Settings ➝ Storage and Data ➝ Manage Storage and sorting media by "Newest." This completely bypassed the privacy protection that View Once was designed to provide.

Security researcher Ramshath first documented the vulnerability in a <a href="https://medium.com/@ramshath1999/how-i-discovered-a-bypass-in-whatsapps-view-once-feature-aea3bdf6405a">Medium post</a>, prompting WhatsApp to acknowledge the issue and develop a fix.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> 4 will feature a notch instead of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, respected display analyst Ross Young <a href="https://x.com/dsccross/status/1884326503393214966?s=46">said today</a>. The device will have a "notch like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>," according to Young, which contradicts a recent leak that depicted a ‌Dynamic Island‌.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            There are two new speculative execution attacks that impact recent Apple chips, according <a href="https://predictors.fail">to data shared today</a> by Georgia Tech students that discovered the vulnerabilities.

<br/>
Named SLAP and FLOP, the two security flaws could allow an attacker to use a malicious webpage to spy on the contents of other webpages, giving attackers remote access to browsing history, credit card data, emails, location information, and more. Physical access to a device is not required, and the attack can be executed through a malicious site that bypasses Apple's browser protections.
<br/>
<br/>
Several Apple A-series and M-series chips are affected, including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> and later and the A15 and later, which are in the following devices:

The spot features the red Beats Pill holding up a be mine sign and playing music in a Say Anything-esque scene. The white Beats Pill walks by and asks how long the red Beats Pill has been outside playing music. "17 hours," replies the speaker, before an end tag comes up that points out the device's 24-hour battery life.
