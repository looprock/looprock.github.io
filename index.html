            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's upcoming "Scary Fast" event will focus on the M3 series MacBook Pro models, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1716871328794620072">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. Kuo's wording suggests that he is expecting multiple M3 chips rather than just a single M3 chip, hinting at the possibility of M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips.

<br/>
If Apple does release M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips at once, we can expect to see the new chips introduced in 13-inch, 14-inch, and 16-inch MacBook Pro models. 
<br/>
<br/>
Kuo says that he previously predicted that Apple would not likely introduce new MacBook Pro models in 2023 because of "limited 4Q 23 shipments," and if new MacBook Pros do come out in November or December, the tight supply will last until the first quarter of 2024.

On <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/?useASL=true">the Events website</a>, Apple has added an option to add the event to your calendar, and on YouTube, there is an option to get a reminder when the event begins.
