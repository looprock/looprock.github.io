Apple continues to sell an <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD564LL/A/apple-usb-superdrive">external SuperDrive</a> for customers who need a CD/DVD drive, but a USB-C adapter is required to use it with modern MacBooks.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Apple Vision Pro headset comes with an external battery pack with a capacity of 3,166 mAh, compared to the 3,274 mAh battery found in the iPhone 15 Pro, although the voltages are different so the measurement alone can't be considered equivalent. Reviewers have also reported that there are significant size and weight differences between the two.

<br/>
According to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/the_vision_pro"><em>Daring Fireball</em>'s John Gruber</a>, the Vision Pro battery is about the width and height of an iPhone 15 Pro, but thicker. Weight-wise, it is also heavier: About 325g, compared to 187g for an iPhone 15 Pro. "It's closer in thickness and weight to two iPhone 15's than it is to one," according to Gruber.

            Apple today stopped signing the iOS 17.2.1 update, preventing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users from downgrading to that version of iOS going forward. iOS 17.2.1 is no longer being signed following the January 22 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/22/apple-releases-ios-17-3/">release of iOS 17.3</a>, which introduced Stolen Device Protection for the ‌iPhone‌ <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-3-features/">and other changes</a>.

<br/>
It is not unusual that iOS 17.2.1 is no longer being signed. Apple routinely stops signing older versions of iOS after new releases in order to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date and to prevent users from downgrading to older, less secure versions of the ‌iPhone‌ operating system.

            Apple today introduced a new firmware update for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>. The new firmware is 6A324, up from the 6A300 firmware <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-releases-new-airpods-firmware-2/">released in September</a>.

Apple does not provide details on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware, so it is unclear what's new. The <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/106340">limited release notes</a> for the update list only "bug fixes and other improvements."

<p id="cLhPan">Yelp is joining the wealth of platforms expanding their use of AI, as it’s <a href="https://blog.yelp.com/news/winter-product-release-2024">rolling out a new feature</a> on iOS that rounds up and summarizes user reviews in a blurb that appears near the top of a company’s Yelp page.</p>
<p id="bV9X8O">The new feature uses large language models (LLMs) to parse through user feedback to highlight “what the business is best known for based on first-hand reviews,” Yelp says. That may include a mention of a location’s atmosphere, popular dishes, amenities, and more. One example (as shown in the image at the top of this article) describes a restaurant as a “retro diner well known for its classic cheeseburgers and affordable prices.”</p>

From today, patients in England can use the NHS App to view all their prescription details, order repeat prescriptions, and generate a barcode for medication collection. The barcode replaces the traditional paper slip given by doctors.
