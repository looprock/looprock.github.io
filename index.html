            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and former Apple design chief Jony Ive have officially teamed up to design an AI-powered personal device and are seeking funding, reports <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/jony-ive-and-sam-altmans-ai-device-startup-in-funding-talks-with-emerson-thrive">The Information</a></em>.

<br/>
Little is known about the AI device at this time, but it won't look like a smartphone. Altman is a major investor in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/humane-ai-pin/">the Humane AI pin</a>, a wearable AI device that does not have a screen, so it's possible he will create a similar product with Ive.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Disney plans to start cracking down on Disney+ password sharing starting in June, Disney CEO Bob Iger said in an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/04/04/disney-ceo-bob-iger-on-streaming-we-have-to-turn-it-into-a-growth-business.html">interview with <em>CNBC</em></a> earlier this week. Iger said that Disney needs to turn its streaming business into a growth business, and one way to do that is to force households that are sharing passwords to sign up for their own accounts.

"In June, we'll be launching our first real foray into password sharing," said Iger. "Just a few countries and a few markets, but then it will grow significantly with a full rollout in September."
