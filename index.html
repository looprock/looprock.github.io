            The design of Apple's upcoming 12.9-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> model has today allegedly been revealed in new CAD renders shared by <em><a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/exclusive-12-9-inch-ipad-air-design-revealed-fresh-renders/">91Mobiles</a></em>.

<br/>
As expected, the renders show an overall appearance that is very similar to the ‌iPad Air‌ design used for the fourth- and fifth-generation models, but simply scaled up to accommodate a larger display.
<br/>
<br/>
The most striking difference on the device is a redesigned rear camera unit, which now protrudes from the rear in a longer pill-shape, unlike the single, round protruding cutout on the current ‌iPad Air‌. This new design seems to be somewhat reminiscent of the rear camera unit of the &lt;a href= [...]<br>

While Vision Pro was the biggest news of the week, there were also big developments in the ongoing Apple Watch blood oxygen patent dispute, with Apple being forced to start selling Series 9 and Ultra 2 models with the sensor disabled for the time being.
<br/>
<br/>
We also got a release time frame for upcoming iOS 17.3 and associated updates, while Apple is now begrudgingly allowing developers to offer non-Apple Store payment options for in-app purchases, so read on below for all the details!

            The Vision Pro features an aluminum frame that houses a single piece of laminated glass for the front of the device, and as we've learned from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, glass is quite breakable.

On <a href="https://support.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/repair">Apple's Vision Pro service page</a>, repair fees are listed.

Apple says that the Vision Pro specifically weighs between 21.2 and 22.9 ounces (600 and 650 grams) depending on which Light Seal and head band is used on the device.

Custom wording of the customer's choice can be engraved into the black plastic sides of the optional ZEISS lens inserts designed for those who normally wear glasses or contact lenses. The option is probably intended to help multiple users identify which lens inserts belong to them, rather than be a novel way to personalize the device, since they are very small and there is no other engraving option for the Vision Pro.
