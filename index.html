            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today said that at least one iPhone 17 model launching next year will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/31/kuo-iphone-17-apple-wi-fi-7-chip/">equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip</a>. For years, Apple has also been rumored to be developing its own in-house 5G chip for iPhones, and Kuo has since provided some clarification about Apple's plans.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            At least one iPhone 17 model launching next year will be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip, according <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1851983650965053494">to Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.

<br/>
All current iPhone models are equipped with a combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip supplied by Broadcom, but Kuo expects Apple to equip "nearly all" of its products with its own in-house Wi-Fi chip "within about three years." The analyst said this move would reduce Apple's component costs and further bolster Apple's hardware and software integration.

All four iPhone 16 models already support Wi-Fi 7 with Broadcom's chip, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/m4-mac-models-no-wi-fi-7/">with some limited specifications</a>. Kuo said Apple's in-house Wi-Fi chip will support [...]<br>

Apple says the new camera provides "enhanced video quality in challenging lighting conditions."

<br/>
Center Stage is a feature that automatically keeps you centered in the camera's view as you move around, while Desk View can show others on a video call both a view of your face and an overhead view of your desk at the same time.
<br/>
<br/>
Center Stage is available in video calling apps like FaceTime and Zoom. The feature was previously limited to newer iPad models and Macs connected to Apple's external Studio Display. The new MacBook Pro and iMac models are the first [...]<br>

<br/>
The new ‌Mac mini‌ looks dramatically different to previous models thanks to a markedly smaller enclosure and two front USB-C ports, but it is also much more powerful thanks to the M4 and M4 Pro chips.
