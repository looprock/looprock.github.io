            Apple is facing mounting resistance from automakers over CarPlay Ultra, its next-generation version of its CarPlay software system for vehicles that was announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/apples-carplay-ultra-now-available/">last month</a>.

<br/>
A new <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cdd7c98a-10a7-437c-a85a-68f7f9be2b0b">Financial Times</a></em> report claims several major brands are walking back their earlier commitments to support the upgraded dashboard software. German luxury manufacturers Mercedes-Benz and Audi have both distanced themselves from the system, along with Volvo, Polestar, and Renault. 
<br/>
<br/>
It's a major retreat from Apple's 2022 announcement, which originally <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/carplay-ultra-automakers/">named 14 automakers&lt;/</a> [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-25 04:21:51-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is expected to release new iPad Pro models powered by its latest M5 chip later this year, and both Samsung Display and LG Display have reportedly begun mass production of the devices' OLED panels in preparation.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959393" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ipad-pro-new-blue.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
For last year's iPad Pro models which debuted OLED displays, Samsung handled supply for the 11-inch panels, while LG dealt with the 13-inch panels. This year, <em>ZDNet Korea</em> reports that the two manufacturers will share supply for both panel sizes, likely as a result of Apple's efforts to diversify its supply chain.
<br/>
<br/>
The change is also likely related to Apple's need to deepen OLED adoption across its suppliers. Reports suggest plans to introduce OLED panels for the iPad mini in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/2026-ipad-air-oled-panels-supplied-samsung/">2026</a> and the iPad Air [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-24 08:20:02-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In the iOS 26 beta, Apple has redesigned the alarm screen in the Clock app, giving it a cleaner look with a larger time display and significantly bigger buttons. When the alarm goes off, you'll now see two large, equal-sized buttons for Stop and Snooze placed side by side at the bottom of the screen.

<br/>
While the redesign fits with Apple's broader visual refresh in iOS 26, it also seems to address a problem the company had already solved: reducing the chances of you hitting Stop instead of Snooze when you're half-awake and fumbling for your phone. Ironically, internal testing once showed that making both buttons the same size actually made that mistake more likely.

Korean outlet <em><a href="https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=5326">The Elec</a></em> reports that Apple is expected to approve or reject LX Semicon's display driver IC this month, which would work alongside LG Innotek's CoF technology. CoF technology attaches display driver chips to panels using heat compression on flexible film, sending signals to control individual pixels through thin-film transistors. 
<br/>
<br/>
The combination enables tighter integration of the panel along the display's edges, which could end up shrinking the visible bezels and creating more scree [...]<br>

<br/>
Following years of rumors, Apple in June 2020 unveiled its plan to transition the entire Mac lineup from Intel processors to its own custom-designed chips.
<br/>
<br/>
Later that year saw the release of the first three Mac models powered by Apple silicon, including a 13-inch MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and Mac mini.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple had plenty of experience after a decade of making custom iPhone and iPad chips, and it was time for the Mac to switch from x86 to Arm architecture.

The company promised, and delivered, industry-leading performance per watt for Macs. This feat allowed it t [...]<br>
