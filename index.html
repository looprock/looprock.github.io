            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has extended its agreement to obtain modems from Qualcomm for three more years, in what appears to be a sign that work on the company's own custom 5G modem is taking longer than previously expected <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-11/apple-aapl-renews-qualcomm-qcom-deal-in-sign-its-own-modem-chip-isn-t-ready"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reports.

<br/>
Apple is Qualcomm's biggest client, accounting for almost a quarter of the company's revenue. In a statement, Qualcomm said that the deal with Apple covers "smartphone launches in 2024, 2025 and 2026." The agreement was set to expire this year and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup was once rumored to be the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/09/apple-in-house-modem-chips-2024/">last to rely on Qualcomm&lt;/a</a> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 17, Safari has gained a new feature called Profiles, which is designed to help separate your browsing sessions into things like Work, School, or Personal. Here's how to use it in the <a href="http://How to Install the iOS 17 Public Beta">beta</a> and when iOS 17 is released to the general public later this month.

<br/>
In ‌iOS 17‌, Apple expands on Tab Groups with a Profile feature that is designed to let you separate your browsing for different use cases. You can create a "Work" profile and a "Personal" profile, for example, so all of your work-related browsing is kept separate from your personal browsing.
