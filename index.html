            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Webhooks are how services notify each other of events. Because of how webhooks work, attackers can impersonate services. This is why most webhook implementations sign their messages. It lets receivers verify the origin of the message. In this tutorial we'll set up a Supabase Edge Function to receive a webhook from Svix and validate the webhook signature.<br>

Twitter user Michael Miraflor said that five people related to his brother's girlfriend were caught in a vehicle in Maui after the wildfires surrounded them. There was no cell service available at their location, so they used Emergency SOS to communicate with first responders.

Miraflor shared a screenshot of the entire Emergency SOS text chain, giving us a look at the local fire department and dispatchers in action. The family was located at the Outlets of Maui, a shopping mall in Lahaina where the fires are located.

I have noted elsewhere how he always held that the actor doubled the value of the author’s words; and he was a great actor as well as a great author. He was a most consummate actor, with this difference from other actors, that he was the first to know the thoughts and invent the fancies to which his voice and action gave the color of life. Representation is the art of other actors; his art was creative as well as representative; it was nothing at second hand.

Worldcoin’s recent listing has rocked the charts, a total success, unlike Neon's adventure. Of course, with the Chat-GPT founder onboard, things were bound to be smoother than a silk highway in the crypto realm. But what worked for <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-strangest-tech-project-happening-right-now-scan-your-eyeballs-for-crypto">Worldcoin</a> did not cut it for Neon.</p>
