            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-24 12:40:08-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has "considered" releasing a bumper case for the upcoming iPhone 17 Air, <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1959665102313205875">according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

<br/>
Similar to the bumper case that Apple introduced for the iPhone 4 in 2010, Gurman said the iPhone 17 Air version of the case would cover the edges of the device, but not the back of it. Those bumper cases were made of rubber.
<br/>
<br/>
Given that the iPhone 17 Air is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-17-air-details-ming-chi-kuo/">expected to have an ultra-thin design</a>, customers who purchase the device might be reluctant to put it inside of a regular case, due to the added thickness.
