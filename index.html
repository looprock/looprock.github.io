            Apple and NBC appear to be the "final contenders" for the rights to MLB's "Sunday Night Baseball" package, and "presumably" even Wild Card postseason games, according to a report this week <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6553812/2025/08/14/mlb-negotiating-with-apple-netflix-espn-nbc-sources/">from <em>The Athletic</em>'s Andrew Marchand</a>.

<br/>
Netflix and ESPN also remain in negotiations with MLB officials, the report said.
<br/>
<br/>
ESPN held the rights to Sunday Night Baseball through the 2028 season, but the network and MLB mutually opted out of the $550-million-per-year contract earlier this year, so ESPN's rights now expire after the 2025 season. Apple is now looking to pick up those final three seasons, along with NBC, while ESPN might negotiate a new weekday package.
