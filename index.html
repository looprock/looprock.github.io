            AirPods have always worked with Android phones, but with limited functionality and a less seamless listening experience. A new app called <a href="https://github.com/kavishdevar/librepods/releases/download/nightly-f547cc1/LibrePods-f547cc1.apk">LibrePods</a> is changing that.

The free app unlocks features on Android that are typically reserved for Apple devices, including ear detection that pauses music when you remove an earbud, Head Gestures for answering calls, and Conversational Awareness that lowers volume while you're talking. It also enables switching between noise control modes, checking accurate battery levels, and customizing accessibility settings.

<br/>
Designed by LA-based Bailey Hikawa to celebrate the 40th anniversary of accessibility at Apple, the grip uses magnets to securely snap onto any iPhone with MagSafe.

            Apple Watch owners have been voicing their frustration online over changes to the Workout app that Apple introduced in watchOS 26, with many finding the redesigned interface makes starting exercises difficult and exasperating.

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005235" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/watchos-26-workout-app.jpg" width="1920"/>

When Apple launched watchOS 26 in September, the Workout app went from large, easily tapped workout tiles to a scrolling, corner-button interface. Instead of tapping a workout once to begin, users now select the workout type, and then tap a smaller play button that appears after a brief animation. Apple has also integrated music and podcast setup directly into the Workout app itself, so users can configure audio to automatically begin playing when they start exercising.

However, many of the changes appear to have become a major source of frustration over the last couple of months, b [...]<br>
