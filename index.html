            Apple today added a few older iPhone and Apple Watch models to the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102772">vintage and obsolete products list</a> on its website.

<br/>
Apple has now classified the iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone XS Max as "vintage" worldwide. Apple considers a device to be "vintage" once five years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale. Apple and Apple Authorized Service Providers sometimes offer repairs for vintage devices, but only if parts remain available.

Note that if you have an iPhone 6s Plus with 32GB of storage, that particular configuration was already classified as "obsolete" prior to today.

Apple has yet to add the smaller iPhone XS and iPhone 6s models to the "vintage" list.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Ever need a moment of privacy without raising suspicion? If you're secretly shopping for a holiday gift or planning a surprise party, you might want to temporarily obscure your actual location in Apple's Find My app on your iPhone without completely turning off location sharing.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-779341" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/FindMy-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Here's a clever trick that lets you keep sharing enabled while displaying a different location – all by using another Apple device you own.
<br/>
<br/>
To hide your actual location, you'll need to own an iPhone and an iPad, or two iPhones or two iPads (i.e. not a Mac) signed in to your Apple Account with Find My enabled. This method works by telling Find My to use a stationary device's location instead of your iPhone's.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WeChat is introducing passkey support for its iOS app, allowing users outside of China to sign in to the country's dominant messaging platform using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>, or their device passcode instead of traditional passwords.

<br/>
Apple introduced passkeys in iOS 16 to provide users with a more secure and convenient authentication method than entering a password. Passkeys offer enhanced security by reducing common risks associated with traditional passwords, such as phishing attacks and credential theft. Since authentication occurs directly on the user's device using biometric data or their device passcode, there are no passwords to compromise or intercept.

<br/>
"Silo" follows the last 10,000 people on Earth, all of whom live in a massive underground bunker to escape the seemingly toxic and deadly world outside. The people are unaware of why the silo was built, and those who seek the truth face deadly consequences. Rebecca Ferguson stars as Juliette Nichols, an engineer who attempts to unravel the mysteries surrounding the silo following a loved one's murder. The sci-fi series is based on Hugh Howey's best-selling book trilogy "Wool." Ferguson and Howey both serve as executive producers.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macbook-pro/">M4 MacBook Pro</a> models feature quantum dot display technology, according to display analyst Ross Young. Apple used a quantum dot film instead of a red KSF phosphor film, a change that provides more vibrant, accurate color results.

<br/>
Young says that Apple has opted for KSF for prior <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> models because it doesn't use toxic element cadmium (typical for quantum dot) and is more efficient (and thus less expensive).
