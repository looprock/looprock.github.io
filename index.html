            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple plans to release at least three iOS versions before the end of April, including iOS 18.2.1, iOS 18.3, and iOS 18.4.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984198" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/iOS-18-on-iPhone-Arrow-Down.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Below, we outline what to expect from each of these updates.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18.2.1</h2>
<br/>
<strong>Update:</strong> Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/06/apple-releases-ios-18-2-1/">released iOS 18.2.1</a> with "important bug fixes."
<br/>
<br/>
Last month, we reported that Apple has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/21/apple-preparing-ios-18-2-1/">internally testing iOS 18.2.1</a>, which is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/24/ios-18-2-1-confirmed/">expected to have a build number of 22C161</a>. The software update's presence in our analytics logs continues to ramp up, so it could be released as early as this week.
