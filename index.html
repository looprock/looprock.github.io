<p id="Cg7qQ2">Google is preparing to hold its annual Google I/O developer conference next week, and naturally, it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/11/24152977/android-ai-google-io-2024-gemini">will be all about AI</a>. The company has made no secret of that. Since last year’s I/O, it has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/6/23990466/google-gemini-llm-ai-model">debuted Gemini</a>, its new, more powerful model meant to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and has been deep in testing new features for Search, Google Maps, and Android. Expect to hear a lot about that stuff this year.</p>
