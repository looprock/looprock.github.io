            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Starting today, the third-generation iPhone SE, iPhone 14, and iPhone 14 Plus, are listed as unavailable on Apple's online store in Switzerland, ahead of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/04/eu-passes-law-to-switch-iphone-to-usb-c-in-2024/">regulation</a> that will require smartphones with wired charging capabilities that are newly placed for sale to be equipped with a USB-C port in the European Union (EU).

<br/>
Switzerland is not officially part of the EU, but the country participates in the single EU market and is thereby subject to EU trading laws.
<br/>
<br/>
While all iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 models are equipped with USB-C ports for wired charging, the iPhone SE, iPhone 14, and iPhone 14 Plus still have Lightning ports, so Apple appears to be responding to the upcoming regulation. The law applies to any i [...]<br>

            OpenAI has expanded the capabilities of its ChatGPT app for macOS, adding support for Apple Notes and a range of popular third-party apps. The update builds on last month's release that introduced the ability to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/14/openai-chatgpt-xcode-for-mac/">read on-screen content from select Mac apps</a>.

This expansion should broaden ChatGPT's utility for both casual users and developers using macOS, as the AI assistant can now interact with content in Apple Notes, Notion, and Quip, alongside numerous development environments including BBEdit, Android Studio, and various JetBrains IDEs.

            Apple launched the controversial "trashcan" <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> eleven years ago today, introducing one of its most criticized designs that persisted through a period of widespread discontentment with the Mac lineup.

<br/>
The redesign took the ‌Mac Pro‌ in an entirely new direction, spearheaded by a polished aluminum cylindrical design that became unofficially dubbed the "trashcan" in the Mac community. All of the ‌Mac Pro‌'s components were mounted around a central thermal dissipation core, cooled by a single fan that pulled air from under the case, through the core, and out the top. The fan could spin more slowly than smaller fans and keep the Mac extremely quiet, even during intense operations.

In line with previous rumors, the Taiwanese research firm today said Apple is planning to introduce both a next-generation Vision Pro and a mainstream headset, which would likely be named "Apple Vision" without the "Pro" modifier.

For the next-generation Vision Pro, TrendForce said Apple will likely consider sourcing components from suppliers beyond Sony to reduce production costs, and this move could contribute to the headset having a lower price.

            Apple has stopped signing iOS 18.1.1, preventing iPhone users who have upgraded to iOS 18.2 from downgrading to that version of iOS. Apple released iOS 18.2 a week ago on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/apple-releases-ios-18-2-update/">December 11</a>.

Apple often stops signing an older version of iOS, usually within a week or two after a new version is released. When an update is no longer signed, it can't be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side software verification check.

<br/>
This policy encourages users to keep their operating systems up to date, ensuring they have the latest security enhancements. Apple also stopped signing iOS 17.7.2 on Wednesday.
