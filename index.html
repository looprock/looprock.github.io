            During its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/wwdc-2024-live-coverage/">WWDC 2024 keynote</a> last week, Apple announced that iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 will let apps offer AirPods-like pairing for more Bluetooth or Wi-Fi accessories.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-06-20 08:27:30-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Starting with iPadOS 18, which will be widely released later this year, iPad apps can offer custom drawing tools for the Apple Pencil.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956430" height="2160" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iPadOS-18-Custom-Drawing-Tool-Apple-Pencil.jpg" width="3840"/>
<br/>
For example, in a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10214/">WWDC 2024 coding video</a> last week, Apple demonstrated how an app could implement a tool that allows for cat paw prints and other animal-related symbols to be added to a drawing. The custom tools support features on the new Apple Pencil Pro, including the squeeze gesture and barrel roll action.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 and visionOS 2 also support custom drawing tools in apps, but the iPhone and Vision Pro do not support the Apple Pencil. As always, any drawing tool can also be controlled with your finger and other input methods.

<br/>
Beats Solo Buds feature a more affordable $79.99 price in the U.S., up to 18 hours of battery life, and a compact USB-C carrying case. However, they lack active noise cancellation, and the carrying case does not have a built-in battery. As a result, the earbuds can only be charged when the case is connected to an external power source.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is introducing a notable enhancement to its virtualization framework in macOS Sequoia by enabling Mac users to sign into iCloud within macOS virtual machines (VMs).  
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954631" height="1102" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-hero-240610.jpg" width="1960"/>
<br/>
Previously, users could not sign into iCloud on macOS VMs, which limited the framework's utility for developers needing to test iCloud features and for users looking to sync their apps with iCloud. As spotted by <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/apple-quietly-improves-mac-virtualization-in-macos-15-sequoia/">ArsTechnica</a></em>, macOS Sequoia removes that barrier, provided that both the host and guest operating systems are macOS 15 or newer.

The feature will be available on Apple silicon Macs, but it has some limitations. Developers aiming to run older macOS versions alongside macOS 15 in a VM or thos [...]<br>
