            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>A little while ago, Etsy introduced a new feature in its iOS app that could place Etsy sellers' artwork on a user's wall using Apple's Augmented Reality (AR) tools. It let them visualize how a piece would look in their space, and even gave them an idea of its size options. When we launched the feature as a beta, it was only available in "wall art"-related categories, and after the initial rollout we were eager to expand it to work with more categories. </p>
<p>What differentiates Etsy is the nature of our sellers’ unique items. Our sellers create offerings that can be personalized in numbers of ways, and they often hand-make orders based on demand. Taking the same approach we did with wall art and attempting to show 3D models of millions of Etsy items – many of which could be further customized – would be a huge undertaking. Nevertheless, with inspiration from <a href="https://careers.etsy.com/global/en/guiding-principles">Etsy's Guiding Principles</a>, we decided to dig deeper into the feature. What could</p> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The garbage collector (GC) does not collect garbage constantly, but at certain intervals. If your code allocates memory for some data structures and then frees them - and so on in a circle - this puts pressure on the GC, even forcing runtime to contact the OS to allocate new memory.

Imagine this scenario: we select a chunk (e.g., []byte), work with it, then we release it. A certain amount of time will pass before the GC collect this chunk. If, during this time, we select another similar chunk and the memory allocated by the OS is insufficient, the application will need to request more memory from the OS. Regarding application time, the memory request from the OS can be time-consuming. Meanwhile, that previously 'used' chunk is left unused.<br>

            It's taken this long, but in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, Apple has added support for multiple timers, and has also made it easy to manage several timers on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> with the introduction of labels.

<br/>
That's right. Believe it or not, iPhones have not included the ability to set multiple ongoing timers until now. In ‌iOS 17‌, the Clock app finally enables several timers to be set that will run down at the same time, allowing you to keep track of more than one thing, which is handy when cooking a meal that includes several dishes, for example.
<br/>
<br/>
Not only can you have several timers counting down at the same time, you can also label timers, which helps you identify each one in your timer list. That way, you'll [...]<br>

which conferences to attend.  Having to make attendance decisions regularly, I came up with the following criteria to help guide my decisions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Employer sales or strategic business purpose for my attendance
  </li><li>Density of community members that requires my attendance
  </li><li>Small enough that my attendance helps the event grow
  </li><li>Non-Postgres event that needs a highly-visible Postgres speaker
  </li><li>Geographically close to my home or another event

<p>"There's no genre more discredited than self-help. It's become synonymous with sentimentality, idiocy and hucksterism. This verdict is not unfair. The book covers are frequently garish; the promises overblown.

            Why would an author give away an unlimited number of copies of her book for free? That's a good question. When `Underground''s researcher, Julian Assange, first suggested releasing an electronic version of the book on the Net for free, I had to stop and think about just that question.

I'd spent nearly three years researching, writing and editing the nearly 500 pages of `Underground'. Julian had worked thousands of hours doing painstaking research; discovering and cultivating sources, digging with great resourcefulness into obscure databases and legal papers, not to mention providing valuable editorial advice.

So why would I give away this carefully ripened fruit for free?

Because part of the joy of creating a piece of art is in knowing that many people can - and are - enjoying it. Particularly people who can't otherwise afford to pay $11 USD for a book. People such as cash strapped hackers. This book is about them, their lives and obsessions. It rubs clear a small circle in the frosted glass so the reader  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed in an interview with <em>CBS Sunday Morning</em>'s John Dickerson that the company's Vision Pro headset remains on schedule for release in early 2024, and revealed that he's already using it on a regular basis. 
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
When asked how he uses the upcoming headset, Cook said he watched "the entire third season of 'Ted Lasso' on the Vision Pro," and admitted there are "some things I have access to that other people don't have access to, so I'm doing that, but that I can't talk to you about."
<br/>
<br/>
Cook went on to say that the challenges Apple has faced creating the headset are "more complex" than making something like the iPhone, so it requires "more innovation, not only in the development but also in the manufacturing." However, the Apple chief batted away any suggestion that the company was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/03/apple-vision-pro-drastic-production-cuts/">facing production issues</a> with the Vision Pro, [...]<br>

<br/>
Prior to the launch of the latest ‌Apple TV‌ 4K, there were rumors that Apple would build ‌Find My‌ functionality into the ‌Siri‌ Remote. That didn't happen, but in its latest major software updates, Apple has introduced a new iPhone option that does essentially the same thing. 
<br/>
<br/>
In early September, Apple quietly released new firmware for its second and third-generation Siri Remotes. With the new firmware, tvOS 17, and iOS 17, if a ‌Siri‌ Remote becomes lost, the ‌Apple TV‌ remote control available in the Control Center on an ‌iPhone‌ can be used to locate the missing remote.

When enabled, users will see a Find My-like interface on  [...]<br>
