            <a href="https://tiptop.com">TipTop</a>, an app for trading in used devices and getting instant cash, today launched a new feature called Shop. With TipTop Shop, users are able to buy new, open box, and refurbished items, while also trading in old devices at the same time.

<br/>
The feature allows customers to sell items, trade them in, and/or buy new devices in a single transaction. It is a unique option for a trade-in/device selling app, as there is no need for a multi-step process when upgrading to a new device.
<br/>
<blockquote>Now, with TipTop Shop you can purchase any item and, at the same time, trade in any device from any manufacturer. Cross brand trade-in is an industry first, as other trade-in programs rely on multiple step transactions, gift cards or other complicated arrangements.
