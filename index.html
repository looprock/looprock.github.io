<br/>
First, the hub adds three USB-A ports to the Mac mini, after Apple went all-in on USB-C and Thunderbolt ports on the latest models.
<br/>
<br/>
Second, the hub gives the Mac mini an SD card slot, which is something it otherwise lacks. Just like on the Mac Studio, it is a front-facing slot.
<br/>
<br/>
Third, the hub includes an NVMe enclosure that allows you to add an SSD with up to 4TB of storage to the Mac mini. This can both expand the Mac mini's storage and allow you to avoid Apple's expensive storage upgrade prices.

<br/>
The lawsuit accuses Apple of broad anticompetitive conduct that affects everything from web browsers and messaging to apps and digital payments. According to the DOJ, Apple has made it harder for consumers to switch between smartphone platforms, blocked the development of cloud-based streaming apps, made the cross-platform messaging experience worse, limited the functionality of third-party smartwatches paired to the iPhone, prevented third-party apps from offering tap-to-pay functionality, and more.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-11-21 04:13:14-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When Apple released iOS 18 in September, it introduced an overhauled Photos app, dropping on users the biggest change to photo management on iPhone since the app's introduction. <em>MacRumors</em> forums users have been particularly vocal about the redesign – some have praised the AI features, but others have called for a return to the simpler interface of iOS 17.

<br/>
The company has made much of Apple Intelligence, so it's no wonder that at the center of Apple's overhaul is an attempt to leverage AI and machine learning to simplify photo organization while introducing a more modern aesthetic. The major changes include a unified scrollable interface that replaces the traditional tab system, smart collections that automatically group photos by occasions like "Recent Days" and "Trips," and significantly enhanced search capabilities [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-11-21 03:21:46-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's base model iPhones have collectively accounted for 42% of its smartphone sales this year, but iPhone Pro Max devices stand as the best-selling individual model, according to new data from <a href="https://cirpapple.substack.com/p/iphone-shapes-and-sizes">Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP)</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964613" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-pro-pro-max.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
The report reveals an interesting sales distribution across Apple's iPhone lineup, but the data needs to be interpreted carefully owing to Apple's tiered product strategy. That's because the company sells several generations of base model iPhones simultaneously at different price points, but it only ever offers a single (current) generation of Pro and Pro Max models. 
<br/>
<br/>
In effect, this means the base model's 42% share represents combined sales across multiple iPhone generations.

Every new iPhone and iPad model comes with a set storage capacity ranging from 64GB to 1TB for iPhones, and 64GB to 2TB for iPads. While it's always a good idea to buy a model with the biggest storage you can afford, depending on your usage sometimes even the highest storage devices can fill up, and it can happen when you least expect it.

            If we plot the metrics associated with large DDoS attacks observed in the last 10 years, does it show a straight, steady increase in an exponential curve that keeps becoming steeper, or is it closer to a linear growth? Our analysis found the growth is not linear but rather is exponential, with the slope varying depending on the metric (rps, pps or bps).<br>
