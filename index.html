            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple and Masimo are back in a California court this week for a bench trial that will see Masimo arguing that Apple illegally poached its employees and stole trade secrets when developing the Apple Watch.

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973055" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/masimo-watch-freedom.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
Masimo first filed the trade secret lawsuit against Apple in 2020, and there was a jury trial in April 2023. During that trial, the court threw out more than half of Masimo's trade secret claims, but the judge ultimately declared a mistrial because the jury was not able to come to a final decision. Six of seven jurors sided with Apple, while one Masimo holdout would not change her opinion.

Apple and Masimo were slated to retry the case with another jury, but Masimo abandoned all claims asking for monetary compensation in order to get a bench trial instead. Masimo originally requested $1.85 billion in da [...]<br>

            The first developer beta of visionOS 2.2 came out yesterday, and it includes a much anticipated new feature for Vision Pro users. When using the Vision Pro as a display for a Mac, there are now options to use wide and ultrawide layouts in addition to the standard virtual display.

We thought we'd check out the new display settings for those who might be interested in seeing how this changes the Vision Pro Mac workflow.

With the wide display option, there's enough screen real estate to use four apps at once without compromising on window size. Ultrawide bumps up the available space even more, and it's almost too much display space.

Apple now has as many employees as it did in 2022, following a slight decrease last year.

<br/>
With the advent of Apple silicon and its unified memory architecture in 2020, the traditional understanding of RAM has evolved, leading to new considerations for users when selecting a memory option. Unlike traditional PC RAM, where separate components like the CPU and GPU each have their own dedicated memory pools, Apple's unified memory architecture allows all processing units to access a single, shared pool of high-bandwidth, low-latency memory. 
<br/>
<br/>
As a result, in Apple silicon systems, data doesn't need to be copied between multiple memory areas, significantly improving speed and power efficiency. By uniting memory, Apple devices with this  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            American automaker General Motors (GM) last year announced it would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/31/general-motors-to-phase-out-apple-carplay/">phasing out support for CarPlay</a> and Android Auto in its new electric vehicles, in favor of its own software platform called Ultifi. The decision has been very controversial, as many drivers consider CarPlay to be a must-have feature in a new vehicle. In 2022, for example, Apple said 79% of U.S. buyers would only consider a vehicle that works with CarPlay.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is surveying its employees about smart glasses as it continues to consider releasing its own version of Meta's Ray-Ban glasses, reports <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/01/meta-ray-bans-ai-training/">Bloomberg</a></em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>. Apple has launched an internal study of products that are on the market, and is currently gathering feedback from Apple employees.

<br/>
In an email sent out to employees, Apple's Product Systems Quality team called for participants for "an upcoming user study with current market smart glasses." According to Gurman, it is common for Apple to use focus groups when it is deciding on whether to enter a new market. Using employees for the focus groups allows Apple to keep its plans secret, something that wouldn't be po [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-11-04 15:15:47-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today stopped signing iOS 18.0.1, preventing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users who have upgraded to iOS 18.1 from downgrading to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-releases-ios-18-1/">released iOS 18.1</a> a week ago on October 28.

<br/>
It is not unusual for Apple to stop signing older versions of iOS shortly after a new version of iOS is released. When Apple stops signing an update, it can no longer be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side software verification check that happens before new software is installed, so those who have upgraded to the latest version of ‌iOS 18‌ cannot downgrade to iOS 18.0.1.
