You’ve likely experienced this peculiar phenomenon: despite sharing the same route and traffic signals, you inevitably encounter a red light while the other vehicle passes through seconds earlier. For a moment, you might think they’ll reach their destination first. However, as you continue, you’re surprised to find them waiting at another red light just a few blocks ahead. This dance continues for a while. The ‘notes’ of this ‘song’ are the micro-random events inherent in traffic: a flock of pigeons crossing the road, a cyclist approaching, a sudden lane change by the vehicle in front.

If you deposited $1,000 into the account, and maintained that balance for one year, you would earn $36.50 in interest based on the current APY.

            The interest rate on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a>'s savings account was today lowered from 3.75% to 3.65%—an all-time low.
