            If you're on the go and want to play your Nintendo Switch on a larger display than the tiny 6-inch to 7-inch screen that is built into the console, you're in luck if you have a USB-C <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. With an app and a couple of accessories, you can use your ‌iPad‌ as your Switch display, as <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera demonstrates in his latest video.

Musk made the comment in response to a tweet asking whether there was a reason to block someone instead of muting someone on the social network. Mute and block are two fundamentally different features on Twitter. Mute prevents you from seeing content from Twitter users, while block prevents other people from seeing your content, following you, and interacting with you.

According to Musk, muting will be the sole way to filter content on Twitter in the future, though there will still be a blocking feature for direct messages. Removing block will allow spam accounts and harassers to inter [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            TLDR:

In modern high-pressure business environments, building a cohesive and adaptable team is crucial. Effective strategies involve selecting members with intrinsic motivation, stress tolerance, self-confidence, teamwork skills, and relevant experience. A positive working environment, devoid of toxicity, and with a clear sense of impact on business goals, is essential. High pressure impacts teams with breakdowns, fatigue, and personal sacrifices, affecting productivity. Leadership plays a pivotal role in guiding teams, involving monitoring, advice, understanding limits, and removing toxicity. Cultivating resilience involves setting challenging but achievable tasks, expanding psychological capacities, while avoiding setting impossible goals. Ultimately, mastering these strategies can transform high-pressure situations into opportunities for growth and excellence.<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-08-18 09:49:48+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The rise of digital assets has led to the emergence of crypto-stealing malware targeting users' devices to exploit vulnerabilities and steal their cryptocurrency. Ransomware encrypts files and demands cryptocurrency ransom; malicious browser extensions secretly collect sensitive information; clippers divert funds by replacing wallet addresses; cryptojacking hijacks devices for mining; remote access Trojans (RATs) grant unauthorized access. To protect against these threats, users should use reputable security software, download from trusted sources, enable 2FA, stay updated, and use offline wallets. Avoid public Wi-Fi, be wary of phishing and extensions, and stay informed to ensure a secure crypto experience.<br>

            Introduction In the first post of this series, I discussed the binary search API from the slices package that is now part of the standard library with the release of version 1.21. In this post, I will share how the Clip, Clone, and Compact APIs work.
Clip The Clip API can be used to remove unused capacity from a slice. This means reducing the capacity of the slice to match its length.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is developing the next several iterations of its M-series Apple silicon chips, and the chips coming in late 2023 and 2024 will be the "M3" series. The M3 chips will use updated TSMC chip manufacturing technology to make them faster and more efficient than ever before.

            One of the common tests for whether something is trademark infringement is whether or not the public will be confused as to association between the infringer and another trademark owner. This typically comes down to several factors, such as the similarity within the uses and, importantly, whether the two entities compete in the same marketplace. [&#8230;]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-08-17 15:28:58-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Nomad today introduced its most powerful charger to date, the <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/ac-adapter-130w-usb-c">130W USB-C Power Adapter</a> that's equipped with three USB-C PD ports. The 130W adapter joins Nomad's existing 65W, 30W, and 20W adapters.

<br/>
Priced at $110, the 130W Power Adapter features the same design as Nomad's prior adapters, so if you have one of the smaller varieties, you can have a matching set. It's got a sleek black "carbide" enclosure, and it does use GaN (gallium nitride) technology to ensure a compact size.
<br/>
<br/>
I always find myself wishing Nomad made its accessories in white or other colors, but black is the Nomad aesthetic and it works. I can say without hesitation that this is the snazziest charging brick I've used, though I have to admit I don't often think too much about the  [...]<br>

Each artwork tells a story about the title it represents. From our <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/selecting-the-best-artwork-for-videos-through-a-b-testing-f6155c4595f6">testing on promotional assets</a>, we know which of these assets have performed well and which ones haven’t. Through this, our teams have developed an intuition of what visual and thematic artwork characteristics work well for what genres of titles. A piece of promotional artwork may resonate more in certain regions, for certain genres, or for fans of particular talent. The complexity of these factors makes it difficult to determine the best creative strategy for upcoming titles.</p><p>Our assets are often created by selecting static im</p> [...]<br>
