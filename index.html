            After Apple released the original <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> in 2010, it tested a second-generation model that only had 8GB of storage. AppleDemoYT, known for sourcing rare prototype devices, recently shared a video featuring the test ‌iPad‌.

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The ‌iPad‌ runs SwitchBoard, Apple's internal factory testing software, instead of a version of iOS. It was manufactured in 2011, but it is a 2012 ‌iPad‌ that has an ‌iPad‌ 2,4 identifier. The ‌iPad‌ is a prototype that Apple used during the Engineering Validation Testing phase of device production.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Anthropic today introduced Claude Sonnet 4.5, which the company says is the "best coding model in the world," outperforming GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro. It's also the strongest model for building complex agents and using computers, plus Anthropic says that it shows substantial gains in reasoning and math compared to Opus 4.1.

<br/>
Along with Claude Sonnet 4.5, Anthropic added a new terminal interface and checkpoints to Claude Code. Checkpoints serve as save points, saving your progress so you can roll back to a previous state as necessary.

The Claude apps now support code execution and file creation for making spreadsheets, slides, and documents directly in the conversation. Claude for Chrome is available as well, with Anthropic allowing some Max users to beta test the feature. There's also a Claude Agent SDK that's ava [...]<br>

            RidePods is a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ridepods-race-with-head/id6752268828?platform=iphone">new iOS game</a> that's designed to use the AirPods as a wearable controller, and it is promoted as the world's first earbuds-controlled game.

<br/>
The idea is to race with head movements, tilting your head left or right to steer and dodge cars. RidePods uses the motion sensors that are built into the AirPods to detect head movements.
<br/>
<br/>
RidePods is a hands-free game, so like an endless runner, the motorcycle propels itself while the player controls the steering and dodging oncoming traffic. The idea is to get the highest score possible.
<br/>
<br/>
To play the game, users will need earbuds with motion sensors, like the AirPods Pro, Pro 2, or Pro 3. The third-generation AirPods and later also work, as do the &lt; [...]<br>

<br/>
<br/>
In 2022 and 2024, Apple did not host an October event. Instead, it announced new products with press releases and a series of shorter product videos.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-29 07:58:15-07:00<p>

<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1001717" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/Apple-CarPlay-Ultra-instrument-cluster-themes-04.jpg" width="2500"/>

"We don't like the execution in round one of Ultra, but we're very committed to Apple," said Farley. "I've talked to [Apple CEO] Tim [Cook] many times about this."

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-29 07:27:14-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, Apple quietly added a neat new option that lets you send smaller-sized previews of images over Messages so that recipients get them right away, before the full-resolution images arrive. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010437" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iOS-26-Messages-Feature-2-1.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Thanks to the new setting, your recipient will receive a lower-quality preview almost instantly, followed by the full-resolution image. And if you're traveling with limited cellular data or using a metered data connection, they only get the compressed preview version – ensuring the original high resolution image doesn't hoover up your data. 
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Enable Send Photo Previews</h2>
<br/>
Apple has made this feature easy to toggle on or off depending on your needs. Here's how to enable it:

<br/>
<li>Open Settings on your iPhone.</li>

<br/>
<br/>
The two monitors are internally code-named J427 and J527. Gurman in February <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/16/new-studio-display-per-mark-gurman/">reported</a> that Apple was "ramping up" work on a new Studio Display. However, since July, Gurman hasn't specifical [...]<br>

            Apple's next MacBook Pro models will enter mass production soon, according to the latest information shared by <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974025" height="2160" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-MacBook-Pro-M4-hero.jpg" width="3840"/>
<br/>
In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-28/apple-s-chatgpt-rival-m5-macbook-air-new-monitor-timing-ads-coming-to-maps-mg3ne6rw"><em>Power On</em> newsletter today</a>, Gurman said he continues to believe the new MacBook Pro models will be released at some point between late 2025 and the first quarter of 2026, meaning they should be available to order by March at the latest.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple often releases new Macs in October, but both Gurman and Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously said the next MacBook Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/10/no-m5-macbook-pro-2025/">might not arrive until early 2026</a>. Apple ann [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is preparing to release iOS 26.0.1, according to a private account on X with a proven track record of sharing information about future iOS versions.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020170" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/iOS-26.0.1-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
The account initially said iOS 26.0.1 would have a build number of 23A350, but they now expect the update to have a build number of 23A355. This suggests that the software update will include more bug fixes or changes than initially planned.
<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> has also seen evidence of iOS 26.0.1 in its visitor logs in recent days, as Apple's software engineers test the update internally.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26.0.1 will likely address a handful of software bugs and issues:<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/17/apple-iphone-17-camera-glitch-fix/">A camera-related bug</a> on the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro</li>
