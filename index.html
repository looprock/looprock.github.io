            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The third watchOS 10.2 beta that Apple released this week reintroduces an Apple Watch feature for swapping watch faces that was initially removed with the upgrade to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>.

<br/>
Users can now choose to use a swipe gesture to switch the active Apple Watch face by enabling the option in the Apple Watch Settings app. With the feature turned on, swiping left or right on the watch face scrolls through the available watch faces that have been set up.
<br/>
<br/>
Switching watch faces with a swipe gesture was the default in watchOS 9, but Apple updated the interaction because of complaints that it was too easy to accidentally change watch faces. The current gesture requires long pressing before swiping to change the active watch face.

Instagram has added more than 20 new filters that can be used to tweak the look of images, and this is the first time in several years that filters have been updated.
