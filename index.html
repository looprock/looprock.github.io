As spotted <a href="https://x.com/MaxWinebach/status/1939725040909451538">by Creative Strategies analyst Max Weinbach</a>, sign-in details for captive Wi-Fi networks are now synced across iPhones and iPads running iOS 26 and iPadOS 26.

A captive Wi-Fi network is the type that requires you to fill out a web form before gaining access. They are commonly found at hotels, gyms, coffee shops, airports, and some other public places.

With Account Lock turned on, account changes like billing updates and wireless number transfers are disabled.

Account Lock will protect AT&amp;T users from SIM swapping, a technique that scammers employ to gain control of a smartphone user's phone number, and by extension, two-factor verification codes sent to that number. With SIM swapping, an attacker calls the carrier's support staff, pretends to be the smartphone user, and asks for a number transfer.
