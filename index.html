Sources familiar with TSMC's operations said that the company's N3 fab in Tainan suffered structural damage, with beams and columns broken, leading to an outright halt in production. EUV machines, essential for manufacturing processes below 7nm, have stopped, and research and development labs have been su [...]<br>

I like big battle maps so that characters, NPCs, and monsters have lots of room to move around and take tactical advantage of ranged spells and attacks. While the big images are grainy when you zoom in, if you save the series of original images that you zoomed out of, you can always zoom back in, so to speak.</p>

It will allegedly be included as part of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/">Apple Design Resources</a> for iOS 18, which helps developers visually design apps using software like Sketch and Photoshop.

Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/07/vision-pro-spatial-personas/">previewed Spatial Personas</a> at WWDC last year.

They feature a transparent background and are able to show body language and additional movement such as hand gestures for a more lifelike experience.
