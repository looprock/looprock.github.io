            Just hours away from WWDC’s opening keynote, some developers have been sharing the contents of their conference swag bags on social media. The bags are given to attendees when they register for the event, and typically contain limited-edition Apple gifts.

<br/>
This year, developers have been registering at Apple's Infinite Loop campus, where they have been gifted a black tote bag emblazoned with the WWDC 2025 logo, along with a gun-metal black drinks flask, a purple lanyard, and collectible enamel pins.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple introduced the popular pin packs at WWDC 2017 and kicked off collections with the old rainbow-themed Apple logo, the "hello" Mac greeting, the Swift and Metal logos, the original Macintosh, and emojis. Attendees also received a flag pin of their home country.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-09 04:17:22-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The next version of Chrome that Google is currently testing drops support for devices running iOS 16, meaning it will be the end of the road for the browser on iPhone X and iPhone 8 models.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-851161" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/Chrome-Feature-22.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Apple dropped support for these devices when it released iOS 17, which Chrome will require to install. Likewise, the upcoming Chrome v138.7204.13 requires iPadOS 17 to run, so the browser will drop support for the iPad 5, iPad Pro (9.7-inch), and iPad Pro 12.9-inch (1st generation).
<br/>
<br/>
The upcoming Chrome is currently undergoing beta testing in TestFlight, but it's not clear when Google will release it. The current version includes support for tab groups on iPad, as well as Google Password Manager syncing for iPhone and iPad, along with stability and performance improvements. <div class="linkback">Tag: &lt;a href="https://www.macr</div> [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-09 04:00:11-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is working on an Apple Music reboot focused around AI, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman. The reporter made the comments during a Discord chat over the weekend.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962031" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/apple-music.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
Gurman didn't eleborate, except to say that Apple has no release ETA for the reboot, suggesting Apple won't mention it at WWDC this week. Turning to rivals like Spotify for inspiration, AI features could potentially include AI-produced playlists or an "AI DJ," but that's just speculation.
<br/>
<br/>
What is expected to be previewed for the Apple Music app this week is support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/04/music-lock-screen-widget-animated-artwork-ios-26/">full screen animated art</a> on the Lock Screen. The current Now Playing view tints the Lock Screen based on album art, but in iOS 26, album art could be even larger.
