            The primary goal of a DTO is to simplify communication between different layers of an application, particularly when transmitting data through various boundary interfaces such as web services, REST APIs, message brokers, or other mechanisms of remote interaction. 

When exchanging information with other systems, it is crucial to minimize unnecessary costs, such as redundant serialization/deserialization, and to ensure a clear data structure that represents a specific contract between the sender and receiver.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In computing lore, an Easter egg typically refers to a secret message, image, or feature intentionally left in software, often (but not always) hidden in plain sight. Since the 1970s, programmers have used them to credit unheralded developers, reference pop culture, sneak games into productivity apps, and generally inject a little bit of humanity into their code.

When Apple was a fledgling company, Mac developers regularly left fun little Easter eggs in software, but not so much these days. While surprises can still be found, they are a lot more subtle and sober, and exist more as a nod and wink to Apple's origins rather than anything edgy or unauthorized. Here are some of our favorite remaining Easter eggs in macOS.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Hello! I am Anna, and since 2020 I have been successfully working as an Android Developer. I mastered Android development from scratch when I was 30+ years old, without having any programming experience before. Before I started learning <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/android-app-development">Android development</a>, I worked for a long time as a personal assistant in various companies, including IT companies. </p>
<p>\
When I worked in IT companies, I had the opportunity to communicate with mobile developers - it was so interesting for me that sometime I began to come to the conclusion that it would be nice to change my career path and become an Android developer. I am now convinced that this was the best choice in my life.</p>
<p>\
My journey into Android development was long and difficult as I didn't have a detailed roadmap to help me along my study way. I had to research a lot of information on the Internet and spend a huge amount of time making some mistakes in my self-learning. Now, looking ba</p> [...]<br>

As we all know, Twitter has undergone a major revamp, introducing X as its unique feature that will catch everyone's attention.</p>

Now, you no longer have to confine your thoughts to a limited 280 characters. With X, you can heighten your social media experience by exploring a new perspective on microblogging.</p>
<p>\
Musk claims that the X will be a one-stop shop for techies; it's a world where you can express your thoughts, exchange playful remarks, and stay forward with the latest trends in a tech-savvy community that shares your passion. We can hope for better and get inclined to adopt the fate of <a href="https://hackernoon.com/elon-musk-sets-his-sights-on-a-different-competitor">Twitter with X</a>!</p>

Apple Watch fast charging was introduced with the Apple Watch Series 7 in 2021, enabling devices to charge rapidly from 0 percent to 80 percent in about 45 minutes.
