            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            This week, our first place winner on the insightful side is Mamba with a response to a comment mischaracterizing a lot of what happened in the last several years: Why do you lie so transparently.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-12-24 10:10:39-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today shared a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07cKD8GK__c">iPhone 15 Plus ad</a> on its YouTube channel that highlights the device's long-lasting battery life.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
In the video, an electrical outlet becomes sentient and sings the song "Way Too Long" by rapper Doe Boy. The outlet is sad that the iPhone 15 Plus lasts so long between charges, resulting in the device being plugged in less often.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple's tech specs say the iPhone 15 Plus can provide up to 26 hours of offline video playback, and up to 100 hours of audio playback. Like the iPhone 14 Plus, the iPhone 15 Plus offers the longest advertised battery life of any iPhone ever.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple's video description:<blockquote>Big screen. Big battery life. iPhone 15 Plus is here. Dynamic Island. New 48MP Main camera. 2x Telephoto. Next-generation portraits. Water resistant (IP68). USB-C. Durable color-infused glass. Aluminum design. You don't want to miss it.&lt;/blockquot</blockquote> [...]<br>

            Apple today confirmed that it will be permanently closing its <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/infiniteloop/">Infinite Loop retail store</a> in Cupertino, California on January 20.

            When the Apple Watch import ban goes into effect after December 25, 2023, Apple will not be able to repair out-of-warranty Apple Watch models in the United States.

<br/>
Beeper Mini operates by identifying text message conversations from iMessage users and converting them to the recognizable blue bubbles associated with Apple's exclusive messaging service. This enables Android users to interact with iMessage features such as reactions, threads, high-quality media sharing, and group chats, without the iPhone users noticing any difference.

            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/">Apple GPT</a> in your pocket? It could be a reality sooner than you think. Apple AI researchers say they have made a key breakthrough in deploying large language models (LLMs) on iPhones and other Apple devices with limited memory by inventing an innovative flash memory utilization technique.

<h2>LLMs and Memory Constraints</h2>
<br/>
LLM-based chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude are incredibly data and memory-intensive, typically requiring vast amounts of memory to function, which is a challenge for devices like iPhones that have limited memory capacity. To tackle this issue, Apple researchers have developed a novel technique that uses flash memory – the same memory where your apps and photos live – to store the AI model's data.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-12-20 19:17:59-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple Savings account holders are currently receiving push notifications informing them that Goldman Sachs has raised the interest rate on the account to an annual percentage yield (APY) of 4.25% from 4.15%. This is the first increase in the interest rate since the feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/apple-card-savings-account-launching-today/">launched back in April</a>.
<br/>

<br/>
While the increase is a welcome one for Apple Savings customers and is a fairly competitive rate, there are some other high-yield savings accounts on the market that currently offer even higher rates.
