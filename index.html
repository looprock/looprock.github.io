            At least one accessory maker is already preparing for the iPhone 16's rumored Capture button, according to an <a href="https://twitter.com/SonnyDickson/status/1772507715694203055?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1772507715694203055%7Ctwgr%5E5e7be999487209a61c674e1803ad1f7e3ce7e390%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macrumors.com%2F2024%2F03%2F26%2Fiphone-16-pro-case-with-capture-button-cutout%2F">image shared today by Sonny Dickson</a>.

Dickson showed off a third-party iPhone 16 Pro case that includes a cutout below the power button on the right edge, which is where the Capture button is expected to be located.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-03-25 07:10:56-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            While the Apple Pencil is currently compatible with iPads only, a future version of the accessory may work with Apple's Vision Pro headset.

<br/>
Apple has internally tested a new Apple Pencil with visionOS support, according to a source familiar with the matter. This would allow the Apple Pencil to be used with drawing apps on the Vision Pro, such as Freeform and Pixelmator.
<br/>
<br/>
No specific details are known about this project, but one possibility is that users would be able to draw with the Apple Pencil on a desk or another flat surface, and the drawing would appear in the open visionOS app. This would essentially turn a person's surroundings into a giant canvas, complete with pressure and tilt sensitivity.
