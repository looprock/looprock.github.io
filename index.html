            The popular iOS game emulator <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688">Delta</a> has received a major update that adds online multiplayer functionality for Nintendo DS games. Version 1.7 of the app now allows players to compete against each other in classic DS titles like <em>Mario Kart DS</em>, <em>Bomberman</em>, and <em>Animal Crossing</em>.

Nintendo officially shut down the original DS online services back in 2014, so Delta relies on alternative Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection servers maintained by the community. The way it works is very straightforward – simply select your preferred server within the emulator settings. No complex DNS or network configuration is required.

            The account @StellaFudge today <a href="https://x.com/StellaFudge/status/1906777369546727641">shared photos</a> of an alleged Apple Watch Series 10 prototype with a unique health sensor design.

<br/>
The health sensor on the prototype has a smaller array of LEDs compared to actual Apple Watch Series 10 models that launched last year. There is also an extra ring of lights around the sensor's perimeter, but it is unclear what it is for.

<br/>
The prototype was running an internal build of watchOS 11.1 that was never released to the public, according to @StellaFudge.
