            Google this week targeted the upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> in an ad for the Pixel 9 Pro, mocking Apple's design plans and suggesting that Apple often copies Android features.

<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The ‌iPhone 17‌ isn't released, of course, so Google's ad is based on rumors that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> is going to get a horizontal camera bar at the back, which is a Pixel-esque design. Dummy models and mockups of the ‌iPhone 17‌ depict a thick horizontal camera bar for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> models, and a slimmer, more Pixel-style camera bar for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-05-06 06:08:30-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Microsoft's Skype has finally shut down, concluding its 22-year tenure as the once-dominant internet calling and messaging service.

<br/>
Microsoft acquired Skype in 2011 for $8.5 billion in what was then its largest-ever acquisition. At its peak, Skype had more than 300 million monthly active users and was synonymous with internet-based voice and video calling.
