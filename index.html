            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the launch of the new M3 14-inch MacBook Pro, Apple has discontinued the 13-inch MacBook Pro. The 13-inch MacBook Pro is no longer listed for sale through Apple's store, with the MacBook Pro section offering only 14-inch and 16-inch models.

<br/>
The 13-inch MacBook Pro was the last Mac with a Touch Bar, so the sunsetting of the 13-inch MacBook Pro also means that the Touch Bar has been officially discontinued.

<br/>
Apple's 13-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> MacBook Pro was priced at $1,299, making it $100 more expensive than the very similar 13-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>.

The updated glass is said to be limited to the Telephoto lens because of the difficult production process and limited production capacity.

The information comes from the ongoing antitrust lawsuit that Google is facing from the U.S. Department of Justice, and it was shared by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/30/23938775/google-search-app-ios-built-in-antitrust"><em>The Verge</em></a>.

Pichai proposed the idea to Cook after Cook said that he wanted Apple to be "deep, deep partners" with Google.

Passkey support would allow iPhone users to sign in to WhatsApp with Face ID, Touch ID, or the device's passcode. Passkeys are stored in iCloud Keychain. To use passkeys on the iPhone, the device must be updated to iOS 16 or later.
