            Apple's "A20" chip designed for next year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models could be considerably more expensive, the <a href="https://www.chinatimes.com/newspapers/20250922000510-260110?chdtv"><em>China Times</em></a> reports.

<br/>
The A20 chip is likely to be the first widely available 2-nanometer chip, debuting in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> lineup next year and forming the foundation of subsequent M6-series chips. The previous three generation A-series chips have all been based on TMSC's 3-nanometer node, with the upgrade to 2-nanometer promising further performance and efficiency improvements.
<br/>
<br/>
TSMC has reportedly told customers, presumably including Apple, to expect pricing that is at least 50% higher than 3-nanometer processors. This [...]<br>

The 13.3-inch frame features an E Ink Spectra 6 display with a resolution of 1600 x 1200.

            <p>&ldquo;Despite there being no systematic age differences between women and men in the workforce according to the US Census, we found that women are represented as younger than men across occupations and social roles in nearly 1.4 million images and videos from Google, Wikipedia, IMDb, Flickr and YouTube, as well as in nine language models trained on billions of words from the internet.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&lsquo;allowing for controversial yet eye-catching content like AI celebrities, OpenAI is borrowing from a playbook perfected by social media companies such as Meta: Do whatever it takes to get users on the app and ask forgiveness later, said Thales Teixeira, a business professor at the University of California at San Diego. “First you grow, and then you try to solve the problems,” he said.”&rsquo;  // Norms arbitrage and breaking the law is a standard business innovation for tech startups.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>If you make huge changes to how your under performing business works, there&rsquo;s a good chance you&rsquo;ll improve things. That applies whether you introduce a new tool - like AI - or not. Just changing how you run meetings for example is a big enough change that could have massive effects. You could say the same thing for introducing Extreme Programming, a lean mindset, DevOps. // The value of enterprise technology is inversely  proportional to how little you need to change the &ldquo;culture.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Using an AI chat desk to augment the support desk for a Us county. This seems like a basic packaging of AI stuff that you could sell to thousands of places. It probably also exposes the redundancy and waste on the US Federalist system. E.g., does every county and city need different bulk trash pickup processes and PDF overviews?</p>
