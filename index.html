            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's new M4 MacBook Air is now being delivered to customers worldwide following the pre-order period that began on March 5.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is expected to replace the iPhone "Plus" model in its upcoming iPhone 17 lineup with an all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air, and so a lot of the rumors about the device have naturally concerned its thickness. Today, we may have learned one more detail in that regard.

<br/>
<em>The Information</em> has said the iPhone 17 Air will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/iphone-17-air-features-reported/">around 6mm thick</a>, while Jeff Pu thinks it will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/18/iphone-17-air-could-be-thinnest-iphone-ever/">6mm thick</a>. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes the iPhone 17 Air will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-17-air-details-ming-chi-kuo/">5.5mm thick</a> at its thinnest point, which likely means it will have a 5.5mm chassis with a thick [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models will utilize vapor chamber cooling technology to improve thermal performance, according to the Chinese leaker known as <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/PibBvE4I7">Instant Digital</a>. 
<br/>

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990412" height="2160" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iphone-17-pro-asherdipps.jpg" width="3840"/>
<br/>
Vapor chamber technology is already common in many premium Android smartphones. By dispersing heat across a larger surface area, it helps prevent thermal throttling and keeps performance stable, which is a major advantage in thinner, more compact devices.
<br/>
<br/>
This isn't the first time we have heard rumors about Apple's use of vapour chamber heatsinks in the iPhone 17 series. In January, Chinese tech news site <em>MyDrivers</em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/iphone-17-major-thermal-upgrade/">claimed</a> that the entire iPhone 17 lineup, including the regular iPhone 17,  [...]<br>
