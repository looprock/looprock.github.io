            iOS 26 can dynamically reserve space for automatic updates, according to Apple.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005033" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/iOS-26-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
"Depending on the amount of free space available, iOS might dynamically reserve update space for Automatic Updates to download and install successfully," says Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26-release-notes">release notes</a> for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/apple-ios-26-developer-beta/">first iOS 26 developer beta</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
This change will ensure that iPhone users who have Automatic Updates turned on in the Settings app actually have enough storage space available for those updates to download and install. However, Apple has not shared any further information about this capability at this time, so it is unclear exactly how it works.<div class="linkback"></div> [...]<br>

<br/>
Starting with Apple's latest software releases, such as iOS 26 and tvOS 26, you will be able to sign in to a supported app on one Apple device and automatically be signed in to the app on other Apple devices. For example, if you sign in to the Disney+ app on your iPhone, you would automatically be signed in to the Disney+ app on your Apple TV. However, it will take time for developers to begin implementing this functionality.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today added the iPhone XS to the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102772">vintage products list</a> on its website.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909569" height="844" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-XS-Max-Black-Background.jpeg" width="1500"/>
<br/>
Apple considers a device to be "vintage" once five years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale. Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers may still offer repairs for vintage devices, subject to parts availability.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple released the iPhone XS in September 2018, and it was discontinued a year later. However, the device remained available through select resellers for longer, so it has only recently reached the five-year mark for vintage status.
<br/>
<br/>
In two more years from now, the iPhone XS will be classified as fully obsolete, at which point Apple will no longer service the device.

Apple already classified the la [...]<br>

            If you <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/get-ios-26-developer-beta-iphone/">installed iOS 26 Beta or iPadOS 26 Beta</a> through Apple's Developer Program or Software Beta Program, you may decide you want to downgrade because of usability or stability issues. Keep reading to learn how it's done.

<br/>
Apple's beta versions of its major software updates can be notoriously buggy, especially the early releases. You may find apps not working properly, poor battery life, device crashes, and features that don't do what they're supposed to. Fortunately, you can restore your iPhone or iPad to the previous version of iOS.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Valve has quietly released a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545611272206420782">Steam Client Beta</a> that runs natively on Apple Silicon, finally ending its reliance on the Rosetta 2 translation layer.

<br/>
The updated Steam client eliminates the performance overhead that plagued Mac gamers since Apple's transition to its own chips. Steam's Chromium-based interface, which could slow to a crawl on occasion, now runs directly on Apple Silicon rather than through Intel emulation.
<br/>
<br/>
Early testers report dramatically faster launch times and smoother navigation through the Store and Library. The difference should be immediately apparent, with basic actions like switching tabs feeling fluid rather than laggy.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's Passwords app is getting a handy new feature in iOS 26 and macOS Tahoe that should eliminate a particularly frustrating password management scenario.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006017" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/passwords-app-macos-tahoe.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
The Passwords app now saves complete version history for stored logins that have been changed, which could be a lifesaver if you find yourself in a situation where a password gets accidentally overwritten.
<br/>
<br/>
Users will find a new "View History" button when opening any login that has multiple saved versions. The history display shows each different password iteration, creation timestamps, and an option to clear the stored versions.

<br/>
Apple launched the standalone Passwords app in iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia after years of burying password management tools within the Settings app, and the version history addition is a nice refine [...]<br>

<br/>
When the setting is enabled, CarPlay will be automatically resized to better fit the shape and size of your vehicle's dashboard screen, if possible.
<br/>
<br/>
The images below show what CarPlay looks like before and after the Smart Display Zoom setting is enabled. With the setting turned on, all of the user interface elements become smaller, allowing for an extra row of app icons to fit on the screen.

<br/>
As spotted <a href="https://x.com/hiddecollee7/status/1933049424898388428">by Hidde Collee</a> and others, Apple Music Replay is now a completely native feature on iOS 26. This means that you can see your monthly and yearly listening statistics directly in the Apple Music app, rather than in a popover web view.
<br/>
<br/>
This change is minor in the grand scheme of things, but for many Apple Music enthusiasts, it is a long-awaited improvement.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple Music Replay is similar to Spotify Wrapped, showcasing the top songs and artists that you listen to each year, complete with a year-end highlight reel.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple Music Replay is available for most of the year, though.

AutoMix is designed to transition from one song to another as the song that's playing ends, using time stretching and beat matching for a seamless shift. Apple says that it's meant to work "like a DJ."
<br/>
<br/>
Songs are designed to transition at the "perfect moment," based on an analysis of the key and tempo of the music. AutoMix replaces Crossfade, and can be enabled when opening up ‌Apple Music‌ after updating to ‌iOS 26‌.
