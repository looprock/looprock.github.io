            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Inflection AI, a promising Gen AI startup, made headlines in June after securing $1.3 billion in funding and a $4 billion valuation within just two years of its launch. The sudden rise was fueled by backing from influential investors like Bill Gates, Eric Schmidt, Reid Hoffman, Microsoft, and Nvidia. Microsoft is supporting Inflection with its cloud computing infrastructure, while Nvidia is contributing 20,000 H100 GPUs for LLM training in partnership with CoreWeave. The company's core product, AI assistant Pi, and its Large Language Model (LLM), Inflection-1, have garnered significant attention. Exploring the founders' vision, the model's development and the company's financial and legal status adds to the intrigue surrounding this AI unicorn. Additionally, uncovering lesser-known details about the founders and their approach to AI risks promises to provide valuable insights into the unique journey of Inflection AI.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Key Takeaways: 

A window function performs a calculation across a set of rows that are somehow related to the current row,

Main types of functions to which window functions are applied are aggregate, ranking and value functions,

To use a window function, you need to apply the over() clause that defines a window (a set of rows) within a query result set. The window function then calculates a value for each row in the window,

To specify the column for which you want to perform aggregation, you need to add the partition by clause to the over() clause. Partition by is somewhat similar to grouping but returns all the rows with the aggregate function applied, instead of one row per group.<br>

<br/>
The Pixel Fold has a display size of 7.6 inches when it is unfolded, but when collapsed, the cover display measures in at 5.8 inches. Both displays feature a refresh rate up to 120Hz, like the latest Pro iPhones. It has a strong hinge that works at any angle, and when closed, there's no gap in the hinge.

Size wise, the Pixel Fold is the perfect size for day to day use when folded thanks to the cover screen, and it's sized like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> X for reference. At 7.6 inches unfolded, it's bigger than any smartphone but smaller than an &lt;a href="https://w [...]<br>
