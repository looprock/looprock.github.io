            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today published a new <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/108266">support document</a> outlining steps to try if your Apple Watch's microphone or speaker is not working as expected.

<br/>
Apple says the steps can also be followed if the Apple Watch speaker's audio is "crackling, distorted, muffled, or intermittent."
<br/>
<br/>
The potential solutions listed include updating your Apple Watch to the latest watchOS version, restarting the Apple Watch, un-pairing and re-pairing the Apple Watch to an iPhone, checking whether Silent Mode or Do Not Disturb is turned on, cleaning the Apple Watch's microphone and speaker, and drying the Apple Watch with a microfiber cloth to ensure there is no water in the microphone and speaker areas.

<br/>
GPT-4.5 will be OpenAI's final non-chain-of-thought model, said Altman in a <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1889755723078443244">post on X (Twitter)</a>. "After that, a top goal for us is to unify o-series models and GPT-series models by creating systems that can use all our tools, know when to think for a long time or not, and generally be useful for a very wide range of tasks," he added.
<br/>
<br/>
To achieve this, GPT-5 will integrate multiple OpenAI technologies, including o3, which will no longer be available as a standalone model. Meanwhile, the free tier of ChatGPT will get unlimited access to GPT-5 at a "standard intelligence setting [...]<br>

            Apple's largest high-end model in the upcoming iPhone 17 series this year will feature a smaller Dynamic Island, according to Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/Pe6wSfDxj">Digital Chat Station</a>.

The leaker claims that the iPhone 17 Pro Max will adopt a "metalens" for Face ID that integrates the transmitter and receiver components, which will reduce the size and thickness of structural elements, resulting in a smaller Dynamic Island on the device.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            There aren't too many 5K displays on the market that can compete with Apple's Studio Display, but ASUS recently came out with the ASUS ProArt Display 5K, which is a solid competitor. The ProArt Display 5K features a 27-inch 5K screen with 218 pixels per inch, aka retina quality.

<div class="center-wrap"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>
<br/>
ASUS sells the ProArt Display 5K for $799, so it's actually half the price of the Studio Display, and much, much cheaper than the Pro Display XDR. The ProArt Display is more generic looking than Apple's monitors, so you're not getting Apple style, but if you're used to looking at a 5K Retina display and you need a second monitor, you can get that same general screen quality at a cheaper price.

In our testing, the ProArt Display 5K was color accurate, sharp, and very similar to the Studio Display. Make sure to watch our video  [...]<br>

As usual for refurbished Macs, prices are discounted by approximately 15% compared to the equivalent new models on Apple's online store. Note that Apple's refurbished inventory changes often, and the order button is still grayed out for some configurations in some countries, so keep checking back if you are eyeing a particular model.

            Apple is exploring both humanoid and non-humanoid robots as future smart home products, according to Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. However, he does not expect the robots to launch for several more years, if ever.

Kuo today <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1889694419907125342">said</a> Apple's robot projects remain in the proof-of-concept stage within the company. In the event that Apple decides to move forward with launching the robots, Kuo believes that mass production likely won't begin until 2028 or later.

Kuo's prediction comes after a team of robotics researchers at Apple designed and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/06/apple-prototypes-tabletop-robot/">prototyped a lamp-like robot</a> with lifelike movements.
