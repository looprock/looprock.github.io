            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Popular password management app 1Password today announced the launch of a new phishing protection feature that's meant to "act as a second pair of eyes" before users provide their passwords to scammers.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
1Password will not autofill a username and password on a website that is spoofing another as one layer of protection, but users can get around that by manually retrieving their usernames and passwords.
<br/>
<br/>
To add further protection, when a user attempts to paste their username and password into a website, the 1Password browser extension will display a pop-up warning that prompts them to pause and use caution before continuing. 1Password hopes that the warning will cause users to take a second, more careful look at the website before proceeding.
<br/>
<br/>
The phishing protection feature will be turned on by default for individual and family plan users, while 1Password Admins can turn it on for employees. The protection is rolling out starting [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2026-01-22 09:31:46-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is expected to release MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips soon, but you might want to pass on them, as bigger changes are around the corner.

<br/>
It has been reported that the MacBook Pro will be receiving a major redesign <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/16/macbook-pro-oled-touch-screen/">in late 2026 or in 2027</a>. Six new features have been rumored so far, including an OLED display, touch capabilities, a Dynamic Island, M6 Pro and M6 Max chips manufactured with TSMC's advanced 2nm process, a thinner design, and built-in cellular connectivity.
<br/>
<br/>
The exact launch timing remains to be seen. Apple has updated the MacBook Pro twice in one year in the past, with the M2 Pro and M2 Max models debuting in January 2023 and the M3 Pro and M3 Max models following in October 2023, so there is a chanc [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Any iPhone, iPad, or Mac with a ProMotion display is capable of rendering buttery smooth 120Hz animations. However, Apple's Safari browser is locked to 60fps page rendering by default, making scrolling feel noticeably choppier for some users than in Chrome or Firefox. Thankfully, recent versions of Safari include a hidden setting that lets you unlock 120Hz rendering.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-816525" height="1090" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iphone-14-pro-120hz-promotion-blue.jpg" width="1948"/>
<br/>
At 60Hz, your screen refreshes every 16.7 milliseconds, meaning each frame of a scrolling page stays on screen for that duration. At 120Hz, the refresh interval drops to 8.3 milliseconds, so the image updates twice as often. This reduces the perceived blur and judder as content moves across the screen, making motion look more fluid and responsive.

            <p>What do platform engineers need to do to prepare for a flood of AI-generated apps? If enterprises let loose &ldquo;knowledge workers&rdquo; with code generation, I think we&rsquo;ll see 10x the amount of little applications out there. This is going to be a flood of Day Two problems for platform engineers, security, people, etc. So, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz7Bl6QzXew">on this week&rsquo;s Tanzu Catsup</a>, I asked Tony how he&rsquo;d recommend handling that flood.</p><br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>My findings after 3 years on AIs playing games is that they’re just generally bad at it. They’re just good enough to string you along, hoping they’ll get good.</p>
<p>Their lack of new ideas and inability to take action gives you a sort of “it’s just about to be good” feel that keeps you playing. Like that feeling that the next pull of the slot machine will be the jackpot.</p>
<p>Also, the memory required for ongoing RPG is vast, the AIs can’t take it.</p>
<p>AI’s can act like an advanced DM’s screen - a bunch of tools - but I’m starting to doubt that they’re any good at the role playing part of DM’ing.</p>
<p>I’ve been <a href="https://youtu.be/OV_ddU4BFvE?si=EK4V2e_8JMLH-AP3">optimistic for awhile</a>, and done a lot of work to get the AI good at playing D&amp;D. I need to think on all this more.</p>
