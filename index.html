            <b>Published:</b> 2024-01-27 06:53:39-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Following the Apple Card savings account's recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/apple-savings-account-apy-increase/">rate increase to 4.5%</a>, we have updated our guide comparing the annual percentage yields (APYs) of some popular high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs) available to U.S. residents.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928948" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/apple-card-savings-account-feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Apple's rate now exceeds that of popular HYSAs offered by the likes of American Express, Capital One, and Discover, but there are a handful of other options that offer even higher APYs in the 4.6% to low 5% range, such as Synchrony Bank and Wealthfront. Balance limits and other requirements vary by provider.
<br/>
<br/>
There are many other HYSAs not listed in our chart, so be sure to do your research before deciding which option is best suited for you.

<br/>
Apple does not charge for the first one million "first annual installs" per iOS account each year, but after that, developers will begin racking up charges. A free or freemium app that goes "viral" and is downloaded more than one million times could be forced to pay astronomical fees, as <a href="https://mastodon.social/@stroughtonsmith/111818345294643786">demonstrated in estimates</a> shared by developer Steve Troughton-Smith.

WebKit is the technology that underpins Safari, but it’s far from the only engine on the market. Google’s Chrome is based on an engine called Blink, which is also part of the overall</p> [...]<br>

<p id="37DA8M">When OpenAI announced other people could build their own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23948957/openai-chatgpt-gpt-custom-developer-platform">custom versions of ChatGPT-style chatbots</a>, I was initially only interested in a journalistic way. I knew this was an interesting commercial step for OpenAI, but the value of the store is still an open question. Why should I use most GPTs (as the bots are called), when I can usually call up an app that does the same thing? But I can’t deny there’s one incredibly useful bot that’s changed a (small) part of my work life for the better. It’s called “What’s Another Word For,” and I made it myself.</p>
