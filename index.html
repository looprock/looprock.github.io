            <b>Published:</b> 2024-01-11 10:56:40-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is planning to produce between 60,000 and 80,000 Vision Pro units for the February 2 launch of the device, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1745516663867629912">analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. With the small size of the shipment, Kuo believes that the Vision Pro will "sell out soon after the release."

According to Kuo, though Apple has not yet defined the key applications for the Vision Pro and the price is high, the "groundbreaking technology innovations" and Apple's "base of core fans and heavy users" will exhaust supplies of the device.

Kuo made similar comments <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/kuo-apple-vision-pro-may-sell-out-fast/">earlier this week</a> when he said that demand for the headset would cause it to sell out during pre-orders,  [...]<br>

Microsoft has briefly overtaken Apple as the most valuable company since 2018, most recently in 2020 and 2021 when concerns about supply chain shortages dented Apple's stock price and a boom in remote working bolstered Microsoft. Over the past year, Microsoft's support for artificial intelligence tools by backing OpenAI has helped boost its value, while equivalent offerings from Apple have been noticeably absent.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is working on an iOS 17.3 update, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/apple-releases-ios-17-3-beta-3-to-developers/">has seeded three betas</a> to developers and public beta testers so far. The update isn't quite as large as the prior iOS 17.2 update <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-3-beta-features/">in terms of new features</a> so the testing period won't be as long, and we are expecting it to launch before the end of January.

In terms of timing, a launch the week of January 22nd might make the most sense. We've had three betas, two of which have not added anything particularly notable, suggesting there isn't much testing left. If Apple plans to launch the update on the 22nd or the 23rd, we can expect to see the release candidate version of the iOS 17.3 update on the 15th, followed by the la [...]<br>

In a document filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, ITC lawyers said "Apple presents a weak and unconvincing case to invoke the extraordinary remedy of a stay pending appeal," adding that Apple's arguments "amount to little more than an indisputably adjudicated infringer requesting permission to continue infringing the asserted patents."
