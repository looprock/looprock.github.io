            Brazil's antitrust regulator has ordered Apple to remove App Store restrictions on third-party payment systems and allow developers to market alternative payment options for in-app purchases. Apple has 20 days to comply or face daily fines of $43,000.

The ruling by the Council for Economic Defense (Cade) comes in response to a 2022 complaint filed by MercadoLibre, Latin America's largest e-commerce platform. The company accused Apple of abusing its monopolistic position by requiring developers to use Apple's own payment system and preventing them from redirecting users to external payment options.
