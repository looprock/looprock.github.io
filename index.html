            <b>Published:</b> 2023-06-17 15:27:23-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Starting with iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and macOS Sonoma, Safari automatically removes tracking parameters from URLs while in Private Browsing Mode, in order to prevent cross-website tracking. When a tracking parameter is detected while browsing or copying a link, Apple says Safari strips the identifying components of the URL, while leaving the rest intact. The links will still work as expected, but will no longer have unique identifiers.

<br/>
Apple calls this new feature Advanced Tracking and Fingerprinting Protection, and it also works for links shared in the Messages and Mail apps. It can even be enabled for regular Safari browsing. On the iPhone, open the Settings app, tap Safari → Advanced → Advanced Tracking and Fingerprinting Protection, and select All Browsing. Users can also turn off the feature in this menu if they prefer [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Since its introduction in iOS 7, AirDrop has become the favored means for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users to instantly share photos, videos, documents, and more to nearby Apple devices with relative ease. Given its widespread popularity, the feature hasn't changed all that much over the years. But this year, Apple is stepping things up a gear by bringing several new capabilities to AirDrop that should make it more powerful than ever.
<br/>

<br/>
The following five features are coming with Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> software update, which is expected to arrive in the fall.
