            <b>Published:</b> 2025-01-24 03:42:25-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Threads, Meta's social network that's meant to rival X, has announced it is rolling out the ability for all users to schedule posts.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-902359" height="607" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/instagram-threads-app.jpg" width="1079"/>
<br/>
Threads can now be created and scheduled to go up at a later date and time. Multiple posts can be scheduled per day, up to 75 days in advance, but it's not possible to schedule replies.
<br/>
<br/>
To use the feature, create a post, select the three-dot menu in the top-left corner, and select "Schedule." Once a time and date for posting has been selected, you can view, delete, or edit the post from the drafts folder. 
<br/>
<br/>
Announcing the feature on <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/DFLhrwRT8pC">Thursday</a>, Instagram head Adam Mosseri added that Threads is also adding a way to "markup" re-shared posts by drawing over, highlighting, or adding arrows to the existing p [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In what may not come as much of a surprise, a new test of Siri's knowledge of Super Bowl history has revealed significant accuracy issues with Apple's virtual assistant, suggesting Apple still has some way to go in overcoming challenges with Siri's ability to provide reliable information.

The results were strikingly poor, with Siri correctly identifying winners only 34% of the time – just 20 correct answers out of 58 played Super Bowls.

<br/>
Perhaps most notably, Siri repeatedly and incorrectly credited the Philadelphia Eagles with 33 Super Bowl victories, de [...]<br>

            Apple today confirmed that "several" car makers still plan to support next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> in future vehicle models. Apple said each car brand will share more details as they near the announcements of these vehicles, but it did not provide a timeframe. Apple previously said next-generation ‌CarPlay‌ would launch in 2024, but that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/23/apple-removes-2024-from-next-gen-carplay-page/">did not happen</a>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's website said the first vehicle models with support for next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> would "arrive in 2024," but that did not happen. A little more than three weeks into 2025, Apple has now updated its website in the U.S. to remove that 2024 timeframe from the next-generation ‌CarPlay‌ section of its overall <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">CarPlay page</a>.

<br/>
The fact that Apple did not remove the entire next-generation ‌CarPlay‌ section from the page suggests that the software might still launch at some point in the future, but Apple is no longer providing a timeframe at this point.
<br/>

It is unclear if Apple, car makers, or both are to blame for the missed 2024 target. We have reached out to Apple for comment.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple introduced the LaserWriter 40 years ago today, forming a cornerstone of what became known as the desktop publishing revolution.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-986748" height="2700" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/apple-laserwriter.jpg" width="4800"/>
<br/>
The LaserWriter was Apple's first laser printer and among the first on the market to incorporate Adobe's PostScript technology, a page description language that allowed for precise and scalable rendering of text, layouts, and graphics. It was a significant departure from the dot-matrix printers of the time.
<br/>
<br/>
The LaserWriter was powered by a Motorola 68000 microprocessor—the same processor used in the Macintosh. With a built-in programming language, its own RAM, and a CPU that ran at a higher speed than the Macintosh, the LaserWriter printer had the most processing power of any Apple product of the time.

            UK regulators on Thursday launched an investigation into Apple and Google's smartphone ecosystems to assess whether they have "strategic market status" (SMS), a designation that if imposed would subject the companies to specific conduct requirements set by the Competition and Markets authority (CMA) to improve competition.

            Apple launched the original <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> 20 years ago today, kickstarting a trend of small but powerful computers.

<br/>
The ‌Mac mini‌ was originally designed as a gateway for users to enter the Apple ecosystem without the expense associated with the company's higher-end offerings of the time, such as the Power Mac G5 and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> G5, and costly peripherals. Apple's then-CEO Steve Jobs described the ‌Mac mini‌ as "the most affordable Mac ever" during its unveiling at Macworld Expo 2005, noting that its $499 starting price was intended to appeal to PC users looking to switch to the Mac platform. Today's base model ‌Mac mini‌ with the M4 chip costs just $599.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            At Yelp, we encountered challenges that prompted us to enhance the training time of our ad-revenue generating models, which use a Wide and Deep Neural Network architecture for predicting ad click-through rates (pCTR). These models handle large tabular datasets with small parameter spaces, requiring innovative data solutions. This blog post delves into our journey of optimizing training time using TensorFlow and Horovod, along with the development of ArrowStreamServer, our in-house library for low-latency data streaming and serving. Together, these components have allowed us to achieve a 1400x speedup in training for business critical models compared to using a single GPU...<br>
