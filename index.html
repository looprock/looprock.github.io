<br/>
There are two models, a 3-in-1 charger and a 2-in-1 charger. The 3-in-1 option has a Qi2 charging surface for an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, an AirPods charger, and an Apple Watch charging puck. The 2-in-1 model drops the AirPods charger, so it has just the Qi2 charging platform and the Apple Watch charger. Depending on the AirPods you have, you can charge them via Qi2 or with an Apple Watch charger anyway.

<br/>
Apple last week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/apples-carplay-ultra-now-available/">announced the launch of CarPlay Ultra</a>, and it offers a Radio app, allowing you to control AM and FM radio stations within CarPlay. With regular CarPlay, you must switch between CarPlay and your vehicle's built-in software interface to control the radio, so CarPlay Ultra will be more convenient for this purpose.
<br/>
<br/>
CarPlay Ultra's built-in Radio app can also be used to control satellite radio stations, but this is less notable given that SiriusXM already offers a CarPlay app.

Backtrack uses the GPS on your Apple Watch to create a virtual breadcrumb trail of your route so you don't have to worry about keeping track of where you're going.

            Within the next decade, generative AI could join computers and electricity as one of the&#160;most transformational technologies&#160;in history, with all of the promise and peril that implies. Governments’ responses to GenAI—including new legal precedents—need to thoughtfully address real-world harms without destroying the public benefits GenAI can offer.

In a video shared by OpenAI, Altman and Ive outlined their partnership and what they expect to create as a result of the merger. "I have a growing sense that everything I have learned over the last 30 years has led me to this place, and to this moment," said Ive. "What we've been working on, I think, has completely captured our imagination."

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple maintained its position as the global leader in the wireless headphone market in the first quarter of 2025, achieving 18.2 million shipments and capturing a 23.3% market share, according to new data from <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-tws-market-q1-2025">Canalys</a>.

<br/>
The data suggests that Apple, including its Beats subsidiary, continues to leverage its hardware-software ecosystem to dominate the true wireless stereo (TWS) market. Although its market share declined slightly from 24.4% in the first quarter of 2024, Apple still obtained a 12% year-over-year growth in shipments, contributing significantly to the global market's overall rebound. Total global TWS shipments rose to 78.3 million units—marking an 18% annual increase, which is the fastest growth rate for the category since 2021.
