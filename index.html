            Apple's new entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro with the standard M3 chip <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/first-m3-mac-orders-australia-nz/">began arriving to customers</a> over the past day, and some early adopters have discovered that the laptop cannot currently be updated to macOS Sonoma over the air.

<br/>
As <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1721742053170684065">noted by @aaronp613 on X</a>, at least some 14-inch MacBook Pro models with the M3 chip shipped with an unreleased build of macOS Ventura 13.5 installed. When users attempt to update to macOS Sonoma in the System Settings app, macOS Ventura 13.5 is listed as the latest version available instead of macOS Sonoma 14.1.

Last week, we were first to report that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/ios-17-1-1-is-coming/">internally testing iOS 17.1.1</a>, based on evidence of the software version in our website's analytics logs.

The USB-C ‌Apple Pencil‌ is compatible with all iPads that have a USB-C port and that are running iOS 17.1 or later.

When it comes to design and feel, the USB-C ‌Apple Pencil‌ is much like the second-generation ‌Apple Pencil‌, featuring a matte finish and a flat side where it can attach to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, but it's worth noting that it's shorter. Unlike the ‌Apple Pencil‌ 2, it is not able to pair with an ‌iPad‌ automatically, and you'll need a USB-C cable for pairing purposes.

Apple's custom battery technology has reportedly been in the works since 2018, with the company actively seeking patents and hiring new personnel related to the project.

Apple is apparently curating the battery's cathode materials to determine its performance, energy density, output, and stability. The battery apparently uses a completely different composition from those that currently exist on the market, adopting a new compo [...]<br>
