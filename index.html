            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Resizing images in macOS is easily done in the Preview app, but if your daily workflow requires you to scale images to a specific size – for uploading to a blog, for example – then using an image resize Quick Action is a much faster way of getting the job done.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-28 05:28:30-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            An iPhone sculpted from a single seamless sheet of glass... It's a vision that was once pursued by former Apple design chief Jony Ive. While the dream was never realized, Apple could take its first tangible step toward it with an all-glass Apple Watch. Or at least that's what one leaker has today suggested. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-965089" height="898" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-Jet-Black.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
According to the Weibo account <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/PkEqB8dkU">Instant Digital</a>, before an all-glass iPhone ever hits the market, we could see an Apple Watch with a touch-interactive, fully-glass frame that blurs the boundaries between screen and enclosure. 
<br/>
<br/>
The Chinese leaker provided no evidence to back their claim. However, the concept appears in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/18/apple-researching-all-glass-designs/">existing Apple patents</a> that describe we [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Instagram has introduced a new fast-forward feature for Reels that allows users to speed through videos by holding down on either edge of the screen. The action plays content at double speed, similar to a feature already available on TikTok.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The Meta-owned platform initially limited Reels to 15-second clips but has since expanded the maximum duration to three minutes, making playback controls increasingly necessary for users who want to quickly navigate through longer content.
<br/>
<br/>
To use the new feature, simply press and hold on the right or left side of their screen while watching a Reel. The video will then play at 2x speed, enabling you to skip to the parts that interest you most.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's upcoming "iPhone Fold" will feature a foldable screen with a 4:3 aspect ratio, according to a Chinese leaker who previously leaked the book-style device's display dimensions.

The Weibo-based account <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PkBXPoR6V">Digital Chat Station</a> claims that Apple will adopt a "roughly" 4:3 aspect ratio on the inner display in order to achieve consistency between the outer display, as well as to ensure parity with existing iPad software.

<br/>
Apple's iPad and iPad Pro models have maintained a 4:3 aspect ratio across generations. The ratio offers a balanced experience in both portrait and landscape orientation, making it particularly versatile for reading/browsing and split-screen multitasking.
