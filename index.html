            Apple never publicly advertises the amount of RAM included in iPhones, but <em>MacRumors</em> has confirmed that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a> is equipped with 8GB of RAM.

<br/>
Given the iPhone 16e supports Apple Intelligence, it was widely expected that the device would have 8GB of RAM, as that is the minimum amount of memory required for Apple Intelligence. All other iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models also have 8GB of RAM, while the iPhone SE that was replaced by the iPhone 16e is equipped with 4GB of RAM.

Since 2006, Apple has partnered with the (RED) brand to raise money for The Global Fund, an organization that aims to combat diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria in Africa.

            Apple's all-new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a> joins the lineup as a cheaper alternative to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>. Despite sharing most of their features, there are still more than 25 differences between the devices to be aware of.

<br/>
There is a $200 price difference between the ‌iPhone 16e‌ and ‌iPhone 16‌. To justify this, the ‌iPhone 16e‌ misses out on features such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> connectivity.

            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a> includes Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-unveils-c1/">new custom C1 5G modem chip</a>, which Apple says improves battery efficiency. The ‌iPhone 16e‌ offers up to 26 hours of video playback, which is the longest battery life in the 6.1-inch form factor.

            Apple did away with the 64GB storage option for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a>, which means all iPhones now start with at least 128GB of storage.

<br/>
Unfortunately, more storage means the ‌iPhone 16e‌ has a $599 starting price instead of a sub-$500 price, but at least <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> buyers will no longer have an unreasonably low amount of storage to work with.

In Chrome for iOS, users can access the new Lens functionality through the three-dot menu by selecting "Search Screen with Google Lens."
