            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, Apple replaced the traditional mute switch with a new multi-function Action Button. The button can be assigned to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-15-pro-how-to-customize-action-button/">perform a number of tasks</a>, ranging from activating the flashlight to turning on the camera. Perhaps the most useful way to use the Action Button is with Shortcuts, because the single button can perform more than one action at once or bring up a selection of tools.

It enables everything from reliable business logic to insightful decision-making and robust machine learning modeling. It is now the norm for tech companies to have a well-developed data platform.

Yet this has come at the cost of quality.</p><p>In this post we will define data quality at a high-level and explore our motivation to achieve better data quality.
