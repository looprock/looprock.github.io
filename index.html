<br/>
In a note to investors seen by <em>MacRumors</em>, Pu said that he continued to expect enhanced Apple product power driven by the likes of the iPhone 17 and Apple Intelligence, but this came despite some "pushouts" seen for Apple's foldable iPad.
<br/>
<br/>
When investors or analysts use the term "pushout" in relation to product releases, they typically mean the expected release date has been moved further into the future, either because there's a delay in the development or manufacturing process, or the company has decided to postpone the launch for other reasons.

The loopholes are linked to mini-apps that allow users of Tencent's social-messaging app WeChat and ByteDance's short-video app Douyin to play games, hail taxis, and make online purchases without leaving the app.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Support for Apple Account Cards in the Wallet app has gone live in Canada and Australia, over two years since it first launched in the United States.

<br/>
The change means users can use the Wallet app to add an Apple Account Card, which displays the Apple credit balance associated with an Apple ID.
