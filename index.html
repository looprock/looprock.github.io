            Apple's motion to stay an Apple Watch sales ban for the duration of its appeal was denied today by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, according to a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/699619677/Federal-Circuit-Denies-Apple-Motion-to-Stay">court document</a> viewed by <em>MacRumors</em>.

            Apple today introduced a new firmware update for the third-generation AirPods. The new firmware is version 6A321, up from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/19/apple-airpods-3-firmware-update-december/">6A317 firmware</a> introduced in December.

<br/>
Apple's AirPods firmware updates often do not come with details on new features, so it is unclear what might be included in the software.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple also does not offer instructions on how to upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ are connected to an iOS device. Putting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ in the case, connecting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to a power source, and then pairing the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to an iOS device or Mac should force the update.

A <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2024/01/16/leftoverlocals-listening-to-llm-responses-through-leaked-gpu-local-memory/">recent investigation</a> by cybersecurity firm Trail of Bits discovered the security flaw, named "LeftoverLocals," which allows attackers with local access to a device to retrieve data processed in the GPU's local memory. The issue is particularly concerning because of the expanding use of GPUs in processing Large Language Models (LLMs) for AI applications.
