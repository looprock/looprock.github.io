            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple sells two external displays, including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/">Pro Display XDR</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/">Studio Display</a>, but neither has received hardware upgrades in years. In fact, the Pro Display XDR is nearly five years old, having been released all the way back in December 2019.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-10-11 11:50:19-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Just over six months after <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman reported that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project/">Apple abandoned its plans to release an electric vehicle</a>, California's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) canceled Apple's autonomous vehicle testing permit, according <a href="https://macreports.com/apple-officially-cancels-autonomous-vehicles-program-manufacturers-testing-permit/">to <em>macReports</em></a>.

<br/>
The report states that the DMV received confirmation from Apple to cancel the permit on September 25, and the permit became canceled as of September 27. While this decision is not surprising given Gurman's reporting earlier this year, this is effectively the final nail in the coffin for Apple's decade-long electric vehicle project.

            A few months ago, the SuperDrive <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/06/apple-superdrive-could-be-discontinued/">went out of stock on Apple's online store</a> in the U.S., and it is now listed as sold out or unavailable in all countries.

<br/>
Introduced in 2008, the SuperDrive is an external CD/DVD drive that was released alongside the original MacBook Air, which lacked a built-in CD/DVD drive. Despite having an outdated USB-A cable attached to it, the SuperDrive remained available on Apple's online store until just recently, becoming one of the company's longest-sold products.

            Apple today <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sph-M-6jNMo">shared a new ad</a> that highlights how artists used the iPad Pro and Apple Pencil Pro to design personalized artwork for seven NHL goalie masks being worn during the 2024-25 season. The artwork was then hand painted onto the masks.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The goalie masks were created for Jeremy Swayman of the Boston Bruins, Jacob Markström of the New Jersey Devils, Stuart Skinner of the Edmonton Oilers, Sam Montembeault of the Montréal Canadiens, Linus Ullmark of the Ottawa Senators, Joseph Woll of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and Thatcher Demko of the Vancouver Canucks.
<br/>
<br/>
NHL goalies have worn personalized masks for decades, but this is the first time that Apple has advertised becoming involved with the creative process.

At least some of the masks were designed in Adobe Photoshop, based on the images below.

Modern MacBooks can last 18 hours or more on a single battery charge, but like all rechargeable batteries, the one in your Mac has a finite lifespan. Over time, its capacity to hold a charge gradually diminishes, potentially leaving you tethered to a power outlet more often than you'd like. This is where understanding your Mac's battery cycle count can be important.

Checking your Mac's battery cycle count provides valuable insight into its overall health and remaining lifespan. A cycle count represents the number of times your battery has gone through a full charge cycle, which occurs when you use 100% of its capacity – whether in one sitting or sprea [...]<br>

<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Submerged was directed by Austrian filmmaker Edward Berger, who also directed 2022 movie All Quiet on the Western Front. Apple shared a behind the scenes video on the making of Submerged, showing off the full-scale 23-ton submarine set that was used for filming.

Submerged, like other Apple Immersive Video content, features high-resolution 3D video that's meant to be viewed on the Vision Pro, and it is meant to make the wearer feel like they are part of the action. Spatial Audio is included for a more immersive experience.
