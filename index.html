            X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, has <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/twitter/id333903271">updated its official app</a> on Apple's App Store to conform with the new branding that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/24/twitter-rebranded-as-x/">announced last weekend</a> by billionaire owner Elon Musk.
