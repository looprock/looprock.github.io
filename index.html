            Large Language Models (LLMs) have a fascinating history that dates back to the early 1930s when the first ideas of computational linguistics were born. You may argue that this tracing is excessive and that LLMs have nothing in common with the old-fashioned prehistoric computer systems. You may also argue that LLMs are based on real, hard-core deep learning. However, deep learning itself originated in 1943, when the first ancestor of the artificial neural model was proposed by McCulloch and Pitts. Exactly 60 years ago! What took us so long to get to modern LLMs?<br>

Second, your sleek Apple MacBook Pro would need upwards of 270 million billion years to match a 70-qubit Quantum Computer at Random Circuit Sampling. Of course, Frontier (see below), not a MacBook Pro, is the ultimate classical computing beast on the planet. But despite its 1.1 Quintillion Hz CPU and GPU processors, it would still need … take a guess … 47 years to beat a 70 qubit Sycamore chip.

            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models are expected to feature a titanium frame instead of a stainless steel frame for the first time, and with the material swap, Apple is also focusing on new colors.

<br/>
Back in July, we teamed up with Unknownz21 to reveal a new dark blue shade that Apple plans to use for the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌, and at that time, we also said that Apple has been testing a silver-gray shade and a space black color. <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/08/24/iphone-15-pro-titanium-no-gold/">9to5Mac</a></em> today said that it has also heard that Apple will be introducing a new dark blue color, which will be joined by silver, space black, and a natural titanium shade.

            Astropad, the company behind the Luna Display and Astropad Studio app, today announced the launch of <a href="https://astropad.com/product/rock-paper-pencil">Rock Paper Pencil</a>, a new screen protector and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> tip kit that are designed to mimic the feel of writing with a pen on paper.

<br/>
According to Astropad, Rock Paper Pencil is meant to have "unmatched realism" thanks to the combination of the custom ‌Apple Pencil‌ tip and screen protector engineered to match. Unlike most screen protectors available, the Rock Paper Pencil screen protector is magnetic, removable, and reusable. It snaps onto an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and can be removed when not needed for writing purposes.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Hardware prototyping consultant Ken Pillonel has created <a href="https://kenp.io/clear-airpods-pro/">a transparent AirPods Pro charging case</a> with a repairable design using 3D printing technology and transparent SLA resin, as part of his ongoing efforts to highlight repairability and sustainability issues in modern consumer electronics.

<br/>
The project began with Pillonel downloading 3D files and employing transparent SLA resin to create the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> case. Using a Formlabs Form 3+ printer, Pillonel printed the parts, cleaned them with IPA, and carefully dried them using compressed air.

<p id="ol34ib">The key issue seemed to be that comments weren’t loading when you were browsing Reddit’s website when not logged in. In an Incognito Chrome window on desktop, I could see that people posted comments but couldn’t actually see what they wrote. At the bottom of the screen, Reddit’s website showed messages that said, “We had a server error...” I saw this issue when logged out on Reddit’s mobile website as well.</p>
