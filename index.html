<br/>
First, Apple now considers the iPhone 5s to be an "obsolete" product worldwide, meaning that Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers no longer offer repairs or other hardware service for the device. Apple says it considers a product "obsolete" once seven years have passed since the company last distributed it for sale.

<br/>
Apple released the iPhone 5s in September 2013, with its key new feature being the Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the Home button. The device also introduced the A7 chip, which was Apple's first iPhone chip with 64-bit architecture.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple plans to add a new text effects feature to the Messages app on iOS 18, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" height="1407" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
While it is already possible to send iMessages with bubble effects or full-screen effects, such as invisible ink or confetti, the text effects would allow you to animate individual words within a message. With the Messages app <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">set to gain RCS support</a> on iOS 18, it is possible the text effects will also work with green bubbles.
<br/>
<br/>
Our hope is that Apple will also add bold, italics, and underline formatting options alongside the text effects, but we have not confirmed that possibility.

In addition to the text effects and RCS support, the Messages app on iOS 18 will reportedly ga [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The upcoming iOS 18 update for the iPhone will include unspecified "updates" to Control Center, according to <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1796399911526920509"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

<br/>
If that sounds familiar, it is because Control Center was rumored to be revamped on <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/07/ios-15-control-center-touch-id-rumor/">both iOS 15</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/05/ios-17-control-center-changes-rumor/">iOS 17</a>, but neither update ended up introducing any significant changes to the feature, which provides quick access to system functions like Wi-Fi, display brightness, volume, and more. However, both of those rumors proved to be from unreliable sources for Apple leaks, whereas Gurman is a more reputable source.
