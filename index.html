            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has been fined €150 million ($162 million) by France's Competition Authority over the implementation of its App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework (via <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-31/france-fines-apple-150-million-over-ios-data-tracking-consent">Bloomberg</a></em>).

<br/>
The French regulator concluded that the way Apple deployed its ATT feature constitutes an abuse of market dominance, finding that the system unnecessarily complicated the process for users to opt out of tracking and unfairly disadvantaged third-party developers and advertising providers. Introduced in 2021 with iOS 14.5, the ATT framework requires apps to request user consent via a pop-up before tracking activity across other apps and websites. If users decline, the app is denied access to the Identifier for  [...]<br>

The two key rumors for the Magic Mouse 3 so far include a relocated charging port, along with a more ergonomic design.
<br/>
<br/>
It was briefly rumored that the Magic Mouse 3 would also feature voice control, but that was <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1873831058065809689">misinterpreted information</a>.

While the Magic Mouse <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-usb-c-magic-accessories/">switched from Lightning to USB-C</a> last year, the charging port is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/magic-mouse-usb-c-port-on-bottom/">still located on the bottom of the mouse</a>, which prevents it from being used while charging.

            <p>In the past, sellers were responsible for managing and fulfilling their own tax obligations. 
However, more and more jurisdictions are now requiring marketplaces such as Etsy to collect the tax from buyers and remit the tax to the relevant authorities. Etsy now plays an active role in collecting tax from buyers and remitting it all over the world.

<p>We determine tax whenever a buyer adds an item to their Etsy shopping cart. The tax determination is based on buyer and seller location and product category, and a set of tax rules and mappings.
