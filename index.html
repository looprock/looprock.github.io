            This past weekend Section 230 turned 30 years old. In those 30 years it has proven to be a marvelous yet misunderstood law, often gravely, as too many, including in Congress and the courts, mistakenly blame it for all the world&#8217;s ills, or at least those that happen in some connection with the Internet.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has announced that its <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/retail/regentstreet/">flagship Regent Street store</a> in London, England reopens on Saturday, February 14, at 10 a.m. local time.

<br/>
The store has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/12/apple-regent-street-store-closed/">temporarily closed for "refurbishment"</a> since Monday, January 12. The extent of the changes remains to be seen.
<br/>
<br/>
It is not yet clear if Apple made any changes that will be visible to customers. In some cases, Apple only updates a store's fixtures or back-of-house area, resulting in no visible differences to customers when business resumes.

Apple first opened up shop on London's world-famous Regent Street in 2004. The store was  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            U.S. ChatGPT users who have a free account or a low-cost Go subscription will start seeing ads starting today, <a href="https://openai.com/index/testing-ads-in-chatgpt/">according to OpenAI</a>.

<br/>
Ads will be limited to the Free and Go subscription tiers, and will be shown to logged-in adult users. OpenAI does not plan to show ads to minors, and the company claims that ads will not influence the answers that ChatGPT provides. OpenAI also says it will not provide advertisers with content from ChatGPT conversations.
<br/>
<br/>
OpenAI is not profitable, and the free and Go tier options require "significant infrastructure and ongoing investment." OpenAI is funding that work through ads, and it says that customers who do not want to see ads can upgrade to a Plus or Pro plan. There's also an option to opt out of ads in exchange for fe [...]<br>

In 2020, Google added a function to its Chrome browser called Scroll to Text Fragment (STTF) that helps you achieve this. It allows URLs to link directly to any visible text on a page. You may have seen it work in Google Search, where clicking on a link in your returned results takes you to a highlighted passage of text further down the page.
<br/>
<br/>
Google later added the feature to the Chromium codebase, so most other popular Chromium browsers like Edge, Opera, Brave, and Vivaldi also support it. Here's how it works.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Samsung is planning to follow Apple in adding a variable aperture to its smartphone cameras, Korea's <a href="https://www.etnews.com/20260209000238"><em>ET News</em></a> reports.

<br/>
A variable aperture allows the camera to adjust the amount of light that reaches the sensor. This means that in dark environments, the aperture can be opened to receive more light, while in light environments, it can be closed to prevent over-exposure. It also should provide users with greater control over depth of field, which refers to how sharp a subject appears in the foreground compared to the background.

            In 2021, Ferrari and its parent company Exor announced a multi-year creative partnership with LoveFrom, the design firm co-founded by Apple's former design chief Jony Ive and fellow designer Marc Newson. Now, in an event held at the Transamerica Pyramid, not far from LoveFrom's studio in San Francisco, Ferrari has shared the first results of that collab by unveiling the interior and interface of its first fully electric car, named "Luce" (Italian for "light").
