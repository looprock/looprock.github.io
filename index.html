            <p>I have attended over one hundred Postgres meetups over the years.  The usual format is:  food with individual discussion, lecture with group questions, and finally more individual
discussion.  I just spoke at an Armenia PostgreSQL User Group <a class="major" href="https://www.meetup.com/armenia-postgresql-user-group/events/312154434/" style="text-decoration: underline;">meetup</a> and the event organizer
<a class="txt2html" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emma-saroyan" style="text-decoration: none;">Emma Saroyan</a> did something different — she did a group mobile phone quiz after my lecture.  To create the quiz questions before the
event, she studied my slides and viewed a previous recording of my talk.  The winner got a copy of her book.
</p>
<p>I think the quiz was a great post-lecture group activity, and gave dynamism to the content.  I know people will remember the quiz fondly when they think about the meetup.  I encourage
all meetups to try similar quizzes, though they do take work to create.

In a research note with investment firm GF Securities this week, obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>, analyst Jeff Pu said he and his colleagues "now expect" Intel to reach a supply deal with Apple for at least some non-pro iPhone chips starting in 2028.

The non-pro iPhone chips would be manufactured with Intel's future 14A process, according to Pu.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            There is uncertainty about Apple's head of hardware engineering John Ternus succeeding <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> as CEO, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/silicon-valley-buzzing-apple-ceo-succession"><em>The Information</em></a> reports.

Ternus is 50 and has worked at Apple since 2001. He is known for being dependable and good at following orders with an obsessive attention to detail. Colleagues describe him as calm, emotionall [...]<br>

<br/>
Apple is expected to introduce the device late next year or in early 2027, based on multiple reports. The so-called "iPhone Fold" is <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f">rumored</a> to feature a 5.5-inch outer display and a book-style design that opens to reveal a roughly 7.8-inch inner screen reminiscent of an iPad mini.
<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/22/foldable-iphone-like-two-iphone-airs/">described</a> the foldable as "super thin and a design achievement," comparing it to "two titanium iPhone Airs side by side."

<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p><em>Anodyne</em> (adj. or noun):</p>

<li>Something that relieves pain or soothes;</li>
<li>By extension, a remark, policy, or idea that is inoffensive, bland, and so safe it has essentially no substance.</li>

<p>In modern writing, people usually mean sense #2: an <em>anodyne statement</em> is technically fine, offends no one, and also does fuck-all to advance the conversation. It’s the corporate press-release vibe: “We take your concerns seriously and are committed to moving forward together.” Totally smooth, totally empty.</p>
