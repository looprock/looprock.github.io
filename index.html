            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple in recent months began providing customers in the U.S. with an extended opportunity to purchase AppleCare+ coverage for their iPhone after a qualifying out-of-warranty repair at an Apple Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider, according to internal Apple documentation reviewed by <em>MacRumors</em>.

<br/>
The so-called "AppleCare+ Enrollment Exceptions" policy <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/08/applecare-for-repaired-iphone-mac-devices/">began in late 2021</a>, but it was originally limited to one year after an iPhone's original purchase date. Now, the eligibility window has been extended to two years after purchase for iPhones in the U.S. only. Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers can only inform customers that this policy exists after an iPhone has been serviced, and customers have [...]<br>

            <p>Related to my previous <a class="txt2html" href="https://momjian.us/main/blogs/pgblog/2023.html#August_30_2023" style="text-decoration: none;">blog entry</a> about bait and switch, I have heard people struggle to distinguish between binaries based on source
code released by the Postgres community and binaries based on modifications of the community source code.  The term "community edition" has often been used to represent binaries in the first category.
</p>
<p>I think this term has several problems.  First, it suggests that there is a non-community edition, i.e., an enterprise edition.  While some companies do produce modified enterprise-focused versions of
Postgres, the community <em>only</em> produces one version of the source code which is designed for hobbyists, developers, small businesses, and large enterprises.
</p>
<p>A second problem is that companies that control the development of open source software often create a "community edition" of their software which is free, and an "enterprise editio</p> [...]<br>

<br/>
While an increasing number of vehicles are supporting text-based ‌Apple Maps‌ navigation prompts in the driver display and/or head-up display, Volvo is one of the first to adopt a full map view on a second screen, and I recently had a chance to test it out in a <a href="https://www.volvocars.com/us/cars/s60-hybrid/">2024 S60 Recharge</a>.
