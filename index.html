            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple will likely hold another event in October this year to announce new Macs and iPads. If so, it would be the fourth time in the last five years that Apple has held an event in October. Last year, Apple held a virtual event <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/">on Monday, October 30</a> to announce new MacBook Pro and iMac models with the M3 series of chips.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            It's been a full week since the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models launched, and we've now had enough time to give the Camera Control button and the camera setup a more in-depth look. We tested the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and Pro Max, which have triple-lens rear camera setups with 48-megapixel Fusion lens, 48-megapixel Ultra Wide lens, and 5x Telephoto lens.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has finally brought T9 dialing support to the iPhone with iOS 18, a feature long available on Android devices. This addition to the Phone app allows users to quickly find and call contacts using the number pad, which can streamline the process of making calls if you've used the feature before.

<br/>
T9 dialing, or Text on 9 keys, is a predictive text technology that emerged in the late 90s to make it easier to type text messages on devices with limited input options, such as traditional mobile phones with numeric keypads. Each number key (2-9) on a T9 keypad is mapped to a set of letters. For example, the key "2" corresponds to "ABC," "3" to "DEF," and so on.

The best match appears first above the keypad, and tapping the person's name will call them. If there are several possible matches in your co [...]<br>

Kuo claims the most significant change in the new model will be the inclusion of Apple's M5 chip, a substantial upgrade from the M2 chip found in the current Vision Pro.
