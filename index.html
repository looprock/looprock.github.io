            Apple has introduced significant updates to its Messages app in iOS 18, with a particular focus on enhancing the popular Tapback feature. Tapbacks, the quick reactions users can add to messages by long-pressing on them, have received a colorful makeover and expanded functionality.

The A16 chip, which debuted in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro two years ago, is reportedly being produced in small but meaningful quantities at TSMC's Fab 21 facility in Arizona. The chips are said to be manufactured using the same 4nm N4P process employed in TSMC's Taiwan factories to ensure consistency in quality and performance.
<br/>
<br/>
The move aligns with previous reports suggesting that TSMC's Arizona plant would begin producing advanced chips for Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/01/tsmc-arizona-4nm-chips-2024/">as early as </a> [...]<br>

<br/>
As things stand, if you have a malfunctioning ‌iPhone 15 or earlier model, a Mac or PC needs to be used to restore the firmware, which is inconvenient as some people might not have the appropriate cable to hand or may no longer even use a computer. 
<br/>
<br/>
Apple has made efforts over the years to remove the need to operate iOS devices with computers. For example, it's already possible to use an iPhone to wirelessly restore an Apple Watch or an Apple TV. Now it looks like the same functionality is coming to new iPhone 16 models.
