            Before the reader is introduced to the modest country medical practitioner who is to be the chief personage of the following tale, it will be well that he should be made acquainted with some particulars as to the locality in which, and the neighbours among whom, our doctor followed his profession.

There is a county in the west of England not so full of life, indeed, nor so widely spoken of as some of its manufacturing leviathan brethren in the north, but which is, nevertheless, very dear to those who know it well. Its green pastures, its waving wheat, its deep and shady and—let us add—dirty lanes, its paths and stiles, its tawny-coloured, well-built rural churches, its avenues of beeches, and frequent Tudor mansions, its constant county hunt, its social graces, and the general air of clanship which pervades it, has made it to its own inhabitants a favoured land of Goshen. It is purely agricultural; agricultural in its produce, agricultural in its poor, and agricultural in its pleasures. There are towns in it [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-09-04 17:03:08+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>\
Programming languages like C/C++ give developers a lot of control over <a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/cpp-memory-management?ref=jsdevjournal.com">memory management</a>. But this comes with a big risk - it's easy to make mistakes that lead to crashes, security holes, or bugs!</p>
<p>\
Some common issues that C/C++ <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/programming">programmers</a> face include:</p>
<p>\</p>
<ul>
<li>Using memory after you've freed it. This leads to crashes or weird bugs down the line.</li>
<li>Forgetting to free memory when you're done with it. This causes memory leaks over time.</li>
<li>Two parts of code accessing the same memory at the same time. This can cause race conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>\
To avoid these problems, Rust uses an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html?ref=jsdevjournal.com">ownership</a> system. This adds some rules that the compiler checks to ensure memory safety.</p>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-09-04 16:10:31+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>\
When it comes to handling forms in React, the most popular approach is to store the input values in state variables. One of the reasons for following this approach is because it's <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/react">React</a>, after all, and everyone tends to use the hooks that come with it. Using hooks solves a lot of problems in React, but is it required when it comes to forms? Let's check it out.</p>
<h2 id="problemwithusingnbspstates">Problem with using States</h2>
<p>As we already know, whenever the value of the state variable changes inside a component, react will re-render the component to match its current state. Though it's not a big issue in small applications, it may cause performance bottlenecks as your application grows in size.  When it comes to form, React will attempt to re-render the component every time the input (state) changes.</p>

In an interview with <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/apple-vision-pro-developers-interview/"><em>Digital Trends</em></a>, Apple executives indicated that there has been a high level of interest in Vision Pro from developers.

The camera configuration of a future "‌iPhone Ultra‌" model released after the launch of the Vision Pro headset will reportedly "lead the market to rethink what kind of photos and videos a mobile phone should take."
