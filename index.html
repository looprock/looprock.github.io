            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 18.4 includes a new Safari feature that puts your searches front and center, showing your recent search history whenever you open up a new Safari tab and tap into the search field.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991973" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/ios-18-4-safari-search.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
When the feature first came out in the iOS 18.4 beta, there was no option to disable it, but Apple rectified that with the fourth beta update. In the Safari section of the Settings app, there is now a "Show Recent Searches" option that can be toggled off.
<br/>
<br/>
Disabling Show Recent Searches returns the Safari search interface to its iOS 18.3.2 behavior, where recent searches are not shown when tapping into the search window of a new tab.

<br/>
Apple appears to have added the option to toggle off the search feature after receiving feedback during the iOS 18.4 beta testing period.

Starting on April 29, the Plex Pass will cost $6.99 per month or $69.99 per year, with a lifetime purchase option available for $249.99. Right now, the lifetime Plex Pass costs $120, while the monthly option is $4.99 and the annual option is $39.99.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 16:09:55-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Along with a foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, Apple is working on a larger foldable device that's somewhere around 19 inches, but rumors have been split on whether it's an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> or a Mac. Some reports refer to the device as an ‌iPad‌, while some call it a Mac, and the split seems to come down to the operating system on the device.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>Is it a Mac?</h2>
<br/>
Some rumors have suggested that Apple is developing a foldable MacBook with an all-display design. The MacBook already has a foldable design, of course, but the difference here would be a single display without an included keyboard and trackpad.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 15:55:41-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today stopped signing iOS 18.3.1, so <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users who have upgraded to iOS 18.3.2 are no longer able to downgrade to the prior version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>. Apple released iOS 18.3.2 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/11/apple-releases-ios-18-3-2/">on March 10</a>.
<br/>

<br/>
It is not unusual for Apple to stop signing older versions of iOS after releasing an update. Software that is not signed cannot be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side verification check, and it keeps ‌iPhone‌ users from installing outdated versions of iOS. ‌iPhone‌ models compatible with ‌iOS 18‌ are only eligible to download and run iOS 18.3.2 at this time.

            California legislators have begun debating a bill (A.B. 412) that would require AI developers to track and disclose every registered copyrighted work used in AI training. At first glance, this might sound like a reasonable step toward transparency. But it’s an impossible standard that could crush small AI startups and developers while giving big tech [&#8230;]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Nanoleaf today announced the launch of the PC Screen Mirror Lightstrip, a new desktop lighting option that is designed to make desktop gaming and entertainment more immersive with rainbow lighting effects.
<br/>

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-995652" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/nanoleaf-light-strip.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
The Screen Mirror Lightstrip connects to a computer using USB-C, and it is able to provide real-time dynamic mirroring that matches whatever is on your screen. It can match the output of a game or a movie, or it can sync to music, with the lights changing to match the rhythm of a song. With a Nanoleaf Premium subscription, there is an Orchestrator mode that provides access to different moods for music experience customization.

<br/>
Nanoleaf designed the Screen Mirror Lightstrip for displays up to 32 inches in size, and it features a flexible zigzag design for simple and precise installation.
