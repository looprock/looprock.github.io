            <b>Published:</b> 2025-01-30 01:54:50-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            TSMC founder Morris Chang has revealed that Apple CEO Tim Cook rejected Intel as an iPhone chip manufacturing partner in 2011, and told him that "Intel just does not know how to be a foundry."
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987694" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/tsmc-founder-morris-chang.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
In a new YouTube interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZItbr4ZJnc">Acquired</a>, Chang recounts how Apple briefly paused discussions with TSMC in February 2011 when Intel's CEO approached Cook about manufacturing Apple's iPhone chips. At the time, Intel was already supplying processors for Apple's Mac lineup.
<br/>
<br/>
Despite the existing relationship, Cook ultimately chose TSMC over Intel after just two months of consideration. According to Chang, Cook's decisive comment about Intel's foundry capabilities came during a private meeting at Apple's headquarters in March 2011.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            OpenAI says it has uncovered evidence that Chinese AI startup DeepSeek used its proprietary models to train a competing open-source model, potentially violating the company's terms of service.
<br/>

<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-987615" height="3030" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/deepseek-ai-app.jpg" width="5386"/>
<br/>
The discovery centers around a technique called "distillation," where developers use outputs from larger AI models to train smaller ones. The practice is common in AI development, but OpenAI claims DeepSeek crossed a line by using it to build a rival model.
<br/>
<br/>
"The issue is when you take it out of the platform and are doing it to create your own model for your own purposes," a source close to OpenAI told the <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a0dfedd1-5255-4fa9-8ccc-1fe01de87ea6">Financial Times</a></em>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WhatsApp has released version 25.2.3 for iOS devices to patch a significant privacy vulnerability that affected its "View Once" feature. The bug allowed users to access photos and videos that were meant to disappear after a single viewing.
<br/>

<br/>
The security flaw, which only impacted iPhone users, allowed anyone to view supposedly ephemeral content by navigating to Settings ➝ Storage and Data ➝ Manage Storage and sorting media by "Newest." This completely bypassed the privacy protection that View Once was designed to provide.

Named SLAP and FLOP, the two security flaws could allow an attacker to use a malicious webpage to spy on the contents of other webpages, giving attackers remote access to browsing history, credit card data, emails, location information, and more. Physical access to a device is not required, and the attack can be executed through a malicious site that bypasses Apple's browser protections.

            <p>One of our <a href="https://www.etsy.com/about">Guiding Principles</a> at Etsy is that we “commit to our craft.” This means that we have a culture of learning, in which we’re constantly looking for opportunities to improve and learn, adopt industry best practices, and share our findings with our colleagues and our community. </p>
<p>As part of that process, Etsy recently adopted <a href="https://developer.android.com/compose">Jetpack Compose</a> – Android's modern toolkit for defining native UIs – as our preferred means of building our Android app. The process of adoption consisted of a gradual expansion in the size and complexity of features built using Compose, eventually culminating in a full rewrite of one of the primary screens in the app. The results of that rewrite gave us the confidence to recommend Compose as the primary tool for our Android engineers to build UIs going forward.</p>
