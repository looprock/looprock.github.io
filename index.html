            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iPhone users are increasingly finding reasons to choose Apple Maps over Google Maps, with some customers commending its clear public transport directions and visually appealing design.

<br/>
That's according to anecdotal reports collected by <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-maps-app-popularity-iphone-8e52aec1">The Wall Street Journal</a></em> (paywalled). While Apple Maps comes preinstalled on all iPhones, the overwhelming majority of iPhones in the U.S. have Google Maps downloaded as an alternative, according to Canalys.
<br/>
<br/>
But that hasn't stopped some users becoming particularly impressed by how far Apple's transit route information has come. The app is often recommended by users for its cleaner view versus the more cluttered design of Google Maps.

For example, Jane Natoli, a Google [...]<br>

            TikTok has <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/passkeys-fido-alliance">announced</a> it is introducing support for passkeys, providing an easier and more secure login method for users of the popular short-form video platform. Apple integrated passkeys into iOS with the launch of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/">iOS 16</a>, and they are also available in iPadOS 16.1 and later and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-13/">macOS Ventura</a>.

<br/>
Passkeys are an industry standard developed by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium, so TikTok's passkey integration will work on Apple devices as well as on other devices that support the feature. 
<br/>
<br/>
Passkeys are both easier to use and more secure than passwords because they let users sign in to apps and sites the same way they  [...]<br>

            Apple does not yet have to implement changes to its "anti-steering" <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> rules that would allow developers to direct customers to purchase options outside the ‌App Store‌.

As noted by <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/17/23798090/apple-epic-supreme-court-app-store-appeal">The Verge</a></em>, Apple was today granted a motion that prevents it from having to make ‌App Store‌ changes for 90 days, giving the company time to ask the Supreme Court to hear the case.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-07-17 13:52:38-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Some customers who had a poor experience with their Apple Savings accounts handled by Goldman Sachs are receiving one-time credits, according to an email received from <em>MacRumors</em> reader Michael, who made a withdrawal in May.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903569" height="824" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/goldman-sachs-email-credit.jpg" width="1465"/>
<br/>
"The experience we provided for a withdrawal request you made for your Savings account in May did not meet our standards," reads the email. As a thank you, Apple and Goldman Sachs informed Michael that he would be receiving a one-time "goodwill credit" of $100 to his savings account.
<br/>
<br/>
It is not clear how many Apple Savings users have received these credits, but the bonus likely stems from issues that some customers ran into over withdrawal waits.
