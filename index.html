Each spot includes a glimpse of the Apple Watch Workout app and messages that the device provides while running. The Apple Watch is able to provide updates on pace and activity segment, as well as alerts when activity rings are closed.

            Last week, Marco Rubio and the State Department revoked visas for five Europeans—including Imran Ahmed, a legal permanent resident in the US married to a US citizen—because they don&#8217;t like their speech about disinformation. The State Department&#8217;s justification? This form of speech suppression is necessary to protect free speech. This is merely the latest episode [&#8230;]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is rumored to be introducing a foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> in September 2026, and since it will bring the biggest form factor change since the ‌iPhone‌ was introduced in 2007, curiosity about the design is high. A 3D designer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/23/have-a-3d-printer-you-can-make-your-own-iphone-fold-dummy/">created an iPhone Fold design</a> based on rumors, and we printed it out to see how it compares to Apple's current iPhones.

The foldable ‌iPhone‌ is going to be smaller than any current ‌iPhone‌ when it's closed, and it'll be shorter than Samsung's Galaxy foldables. Rumors suggest it'll be somewhere around 5.4 inches, which would make it as small as the now-discontinued ‌iPhone‌ 13 mini.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple now has additional time to allow for tariffs on Chinese semiconductors, thanks to a delay on any actual cost impact until June 2027.
<br/>

<br/>
While the United States will still apply new tariffs on semiconductor imports from China, the effective tariff rate will be set at zero for approximately 18 months, according to a Federal Register <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-23912.pdf">filing</a> (via <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/23/us-china-chip-tariffs.html">CNBC</a></em>).

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-12-28 04:24:44-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Support for Apple Car Keys may now be more likely to come to Tesla vehicles, amid new evidence that the automaker is embracing native, system-level digital car keys.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-776244" height="827" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/tesla-red-orange-bg-feature.jpg" width="1560"/>
<br/>
According to <a href="https://www.notateslaapp.com/news/3455/tesla-may-add-apple-wallet-car-key-support"><em>Not a Tesla App</em></a>, 4.52.0 of Tesla's mobile app contains multiple code references to Harmony Wallet Key Cards. The discovery is notable because it represents a shift in how Tesla appears to be approaching mobile device integration. 
<br/>
<br/>
Tesla's current Phone Key relies on Bluetooth communication between the vehicle and the Tesla app running in the background on a smartphone. By contrast, a native wallet key is stored at the operating system level and uses secure hardware elements, often making it more reliable and accessible.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple reportedly tested a version of the first-generation AirPods with bright, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 5c-like colored charging cases.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The images, shared by the Apple leaker and prototype collector known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a>," claim to show first-generation AirPods prototypes with pink and yellow exterior casings. The interior of the charging case and the earbuds themselves remain white.
<br/>
<br/>
They seem close to some of the color options offered for the ‌iPhone‌ 5c, which came in blue, green, pink, yellow and white. Apple has only ever released AirPods in white.

<blockquote>
<p>The choice of where and how to start your AI journey is a business decision, not a technology one. By grounding your AI efforts in the operational muscle you’ve already built with Java and Spring, you minimize friction and risk. Everyone just keeps doing what they’re doing, but with a new tool. This established operational and development life is the hard-won experience, paid for in decades of maintenance and gut-wrenching production failures, that gives you the platform to continuously absorb new capabilities like Spring AI and MCP.</p>
<p>Get the developer experience and the operator experience right, and you unlock the organizational velocity needed to turn tentative AI experiments into a mission-critical competitive advantage.</p>
