Next, I import the file into my document editor, <a class="txt2html" href="https://www.lyx.org/" style="text-decoration: none;">LyX.</a>  I then add slide
headings, markup, colors, and supporting text.  Sometimes there are too many SQL queries to efficiently manage in a single file so I use multiple files and name them with numeric prefixes, e.g.,
