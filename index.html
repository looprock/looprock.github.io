According to Zuckerberg, the Quest 3 is better "for the vast majority of things that people use mixed reality for," and here are some of the things he said about the Meta Quest 3:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>It's 7x less expensive than Vision Pro.</li>
<br/>
<li>It does high-quality passthrough with big screens "just like Vision Pro."</li>
<br/>
<li>Quest is a lot more comfortable - it's 120 grams less.</li>

As reported by <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/13/24071693/kimi-movie-piracy-app-store-trending-apple-iphone-ios">The Verge</a></em>, Kimi's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> listing claimed that it was an app that "tests your eyesight," but when downloaded and installed, it opened right up to a clear TV show and movie interface for downloading and watching pirated content. There was no attempt to hide the app's true purpose behind some kind of vision test interface, which begs the question of how it made its way past the ‌App Store‌ review team.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iMessage will avoid regulation requiring interoperability with other messaging platforms under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), following the conclusion of an investigation by the regulator (via <em><em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-13/apple-imessage-microsoft-bing-dodge-eu-s-big-tech-crackdown">Bloomberg</a></em></em>).

<br/>
The probe concluded that the iMessage platform and Microsoft's Bing do not hold a dominant enough position to be brought under the DMA's strict rules for services provided by big tech's so-called digital "gatekeepers," which include Apple, Meta, Google, Amazon, and TikTok, according to the EU.

Apple and Microsoft said they welcomed the decision to not designate them as core platform services in separate statements following the announcement.
