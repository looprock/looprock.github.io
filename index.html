            Some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, 16, and 17 models could be banned in the United States amid a preliminary ruling that Chinese display maker BOE infringed on Samsung's OLED trade secrets (via Korea's <em><a href="https://m.etnews.com/20250714000375">ETNews</a></em>).

<br/>
A preliminary ruling from the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) found that that BOE and seven of its subsidiaries violated the U.S. Tariff Act by misappropriating confidential OLED technology from Samsung Display. The ruling recommends both a restricted exclusion order, which would block imports of infringing OLED panels and modules into the United States, and a cease and desist order, which would stop the company from selling existing inventories or suppling future shipments to U.S. assemblers.

            The rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/08/iphone-17-air-dummy-model-video/">iPhone 17 Air</a> will have a titanium frame, according to Apple analyst Jeff Pu.

<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010921" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iPhone-17-Air-Thumb-2-Blue-Electric-Boogaloo.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
In an investor note with equity research firm GF Securities this week, Pu also said the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will have aluminum frames, so the iPhone 17 Air will apparently be the only new model to use titanium.
<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear why the iPhone 17 Air would have a titanium frame, as aluminum is lighter than titanium, which would be fitting for the device's rumored ultra-thin and lightweight design. Titanium is generally stronger than aluminum, however, so perhaps the material is necessary to ensure that the iPhone 17 Air's thin chassis is durable.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The sleep apnea detection feature that Apple's most recent Apple Watch models offer has expanded to several more countries in Europe, Asia, South America, and more.

<br/>
Sleep apnea is a disorder where a person's breathing repeatedly stops and starts again during sleep, preventing rest. Sleep apnea detection on Apple Watch uses the device's accelerometer to monitor tiny movements at the wrist that are linked with interruptions in respiratory patterns. Disturbances that occur multiple times over several nights can indicate sleep apnea.

<br/>
Sleep apnea detection and notifications have expanded to the following areas:

<ul>
<br/>
<li>Argentina</li>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Samsung Display will supply Apple with "crease-free" displays for its long-rumored foldable iPhone, according to <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/acBH2tItErAhI2">Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.
<br/>

<br/>
To achieve a crease-free inner display, Kuo said the foldable iPhone will utilize a metal plate that can disperse and control the stress generated by bending the display. The metal plates will be primarily supplied by a company named Fine M-Tec, he said.
<br/>
<br/>
Samsung's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/samsung-galaxy-z-fold7/">new Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> still has a visible crease in the middle of its inner screen, so it seems like Samsung Display would have to be developing a custom solution for Apple in order for the foldable iPhone to truly have a "crease-free" design.

The change was confirmed in a draft document circulated within the European Commission late last week that was <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/victory-eu-donald-trump-meta-tax-digital/">obtained by <em>Politico</em></a>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Originally published in 2019, this article is part two of a three-part series exploring Go’s garbage collector. Though the Go runtime has continued to evolve, the performance principles covered here remain highly relevant today. This installment focuses on practical techniques for analyzing and reducing garbage collection (GC) overhead in real-world Go applications. It walks through how to interpret GC traces using GODEBUG=gctrace=1 and uncover allocation hotspots with pprof, with a clear message: reducing unnecessary allocations, especially in tight loops, has a direct and measurable impact on latency and throughput.<br>
