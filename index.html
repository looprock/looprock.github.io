            The rise, decline, and potential rebirth of cryptocurrency serve as a sobering lesson in technological ambition, speculative mania, and the harsh reality of an unpredictable market. Crypto's downfall was exacerbated by the numerous high-profile security breaches and hacking incidents that rocked the industry.

            Device fingerprinting is a method to identify a device using a combination of attributes provided by the device itself, via its browser and device configuration. The more pieces I add to the fingerprint, the more granular it becomes. In this way, I can abstract a small niche of users with one fingerprint and track their behavior, without using cookies.<br>

            We are in the middle of July. The astronomical dog-days are just beginning; but in reality the torrid season has anticipated the calendar and for some weeks past the heat has been overpowering.
This evening in the village they are celebrating the National Festival.1 While the little boys and girls are hopping around a bonfire whose gleams are reflected upon the church-steeple, while the drum is pounded to mark the ascent of each rocket, I am sitting alone in a dark corner, in the comparative coolness that prevails at nine o’clock, harking to the concert of the festival of the fields, the festival of the harvest, grander by far than that which, at this moment, is being celebrated in the village square with gun-powder, lighted torches, Chinese lanterns and, above all, strong drink. It has the simplicity of beauty and the repose of strength.<br>

            The species of the genus Sphex are fairly numerous, but are for the most part strangers to my country. As far as I know, the French fauna numbers only three, all lovers of the hot sun of the olive district, namely, the Yellow-winged Sphex (Sphex flavipennis), the White-edged Sphex (S. albisecta), and the Languedocian Sphex (S. occitanica). Now it is not without a lively interest that the observer notices in the case of these three freebooters a choice of provisions which is in strict accordance with the rigid laws of entomological classification. To feed their grubs, all three choose solely Orthoptera.The first hunts Crickets, the second Locusts, the third Ephippigers.<br>

In those days it was done in all simplicity. In Victor Hugo’s Notre Dame de Paris an edifying and gratuitous spectacle was provided for the people in the Hôtel de Ville of Paris in the reign of Louis XI. in honor of the birth of the dauphin. It was called Le bon jugement de la très sainte et gracieuse Vierge Marie, and she appears herself on the stage and pronounces her bon jugement.

            THE next day Emile, when only half awake, began to think of the ants’ cows. “We must beg uncle,” said he to Jules, “to tell us the rest of his story this morning.”
No sooner said than done: they went to look for their uncle.
“Aha!” cried he upon hearing their request, “the ants’ cows are interesting you. I will do better than tell you about them, I will show them to you. First of all call Claire.”
Claire came in haste. Their uncle took them under the elder bush in the garden, and this is what they saw:
The bush is white with flowers. Bees, flies, beetles, butterflies, fly from one flower to another with a drowsy murmur. On the trunk of the elder, amongst the ridges of the bark, numbers of ants are crawling, some ascending, some descending. Those ascending are the more eager. They sometimes stop the others on the way and appear to consult them as to what is going on above. Being informed, they begin climbing again with even more ardor, proof that the news is good. Those descending go in a leisurely manner, wit [...]<br>

<br/>
In iOS, many apps display a different view when you rotate your iPhone from portrait to landscape orientation. Depending on the app and the way you use it, this behavior isn't always desirable, which is why Apple includes the Orientation Lock option in Control Center. 
<br/>
<br/>
However, certain apps work more usefully with Orientation Lock disabled – think YouTube or the Photos app, where rotating your device to landscape orientation makes for a better fullscreen viewing experience. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you tend to keep the lock on, you have to disable it in Control Center each time you open these kinds of apps to get the fullscreen experience. Then when you close the app, you have to r [...]<br>

            A large language model (LLM) is a type of AI algorithm that uses deep learning techniques and massively large datasets to understand, summarize, generate, and predict new content. To solve some of these subtasks, it’s not enough to simply pump out an X amount of data. An analysis or other qualitative assessment is also necessary since the quality of the final model depends on it. One way to achieve this is to use crowdsourcing.

The ability to search by image gives buyers the opportunity to search the Etsy marketplace using their own photos as a reference. Tap the camera icon in the search bar to take a picture, and in a fraction of a second we’ll surface visually similar results from our inventory of nearly 100 million listings. Searching by image is being rapidly adopted throughout the e-commerce industry, and nowhere does it make more sense than on Etsy, where the uniqueness of our sellers’ creations can’t always be expressed easily with words.
