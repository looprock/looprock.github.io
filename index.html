            <b>Published:</b> 2023-09-21 09:37:54+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Bonding curves are mathematical functions increasingly used in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) to link the supply of a digital asset with its value. They enable automated, fair valuation of assets, allowing tokens to be issued without reliance on traditional exchanges, order books, or centralized control. This promotes liquidity and project financing, reducing token manipulation risks. In Obyte, an Autonomous Agent (AA) operates as an Automated Market Maker (AMM), handling issuance, redemption, and reserve storage, ensuring decentralized operation. There are two models of bonded stablecoins, v1 and v2, each addressing price stability differently. Bonding curves are also employed in prediction markets like Prophet and governance tokens such as OSWAP for liquidity provision and governance participation. Overall, bonding curves enhance DeFi's automation, effectiveness, and decentralization.<br>

The topic today is the definition of open source, the constant pressure on the true definition of the term, and the seemingly small but vocal minority that aim to protect that definition. In Steve’s post Why Open Source Matters, he says “open source is at a crossroads” and there are some seeking to break the definition of open source to one that is more permissive to their desires, and they are closer than ever to achieving that goal.

According to three individuals familiar with the matter talking to <em>CNBC</em>, the feature would have served as a rival to trading apps like Robinhood, allowing users to buy and sell stocks directly from their ‌iPhone‌ in a convenient way.
