            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has abruptly reduced production of the Vision Pro headset and could stop making the current version of the device completely by the end of 2024, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-sharply-scales-back-production-of-vision-pro"><em>The Information</em></a> reports.

Citing multiple people "directly involved" in making components for the headset, the report says that the scaling back of production began in the early summer. This indicates that Apple now has a sufficient number of Vision Pro units in its inventory to meet demand for the device's remaining lifespan through to next year.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18, Apple includes a new over-the-air recovery feature designed to revive bricked iPhone 16 devices using another iPhone or an iPad, and it appears that the same feature can be used to recover the new iPad mini 7, too.

<br/>
In iOS 18, placing an iPhone 16 next to another iPhone or iPad can start an over-the-air firmware recovery – the other device downloads a new iOS firmware and transfers it to the bricked device, removing the need to connect it to a computer. ‌This contrasts with iPhone 15 and earlier models, which require connection to a Mac or PC to restore the firmware.
