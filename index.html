Beats introduced special-edition Light Gray and Dark Gray versions in a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/kim-kardashian-beats-pill/">collaboration with Kim Kardashian</a> back in October, but those have since been discontinued.

            <p>Let&rsquo;s get the AI to build D&amp;D adventures for us with a Model Context Protocol Prompt. I haven&rsquo;t found much value in MCP Prompts until now. What makes them excited is when you use them a &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; to chain together other tool calls. In this episode of my MCP programming series, I show you how to make two MCP Prompts. First, a simple one that boot-straps playing D&amp;D. Second, a more complex one that pulls together an adventure overview using multiple tools and &ldquo;reasoning.&rdquo; I think the result gets to a type of agentic AI.</p>

How can you make sure they don&rsquo;t forget all that loot you just got, or ensure that cobbler back in the village remembers the type of boots you orders and paid for up front? I&rsquo;ll show you how to use Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create a DM Journal. This is done by writing an MCP Server tool that write journal entries and then an MCP Server Resource that allows you to read them. It&rsquo;s just files, but it&rsquo;s a good excuse to learn some agentic AI coding in Java, with the help of Spring AI.</p>

            Sometimes when you share a webpage link with someone, you just want to bring their attention to a specific passage or sentence to make your point, rather than have them read through the entire article.

In 2020, Google added a function to its Chrome browser called Scroll to Text Fragment (STTF) that helps you achieve this. It allows URLs to link directly to any visible text on a page. You may have seen it work in Google Search, where clicking on a link in your returned results takes you to a highlighted passage of text further down the page.
<br/>
<br/>
Since then, Google has built the feature into the open source Chromium code, so most other popular Chromium browsers like Edge, Opera, and Vivaldi also have it these days. (Brave is an exception, citing &lt;a href="https://github.com/WICG/scroll-to-text-fragment/issues/76 [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Not only can you give more direction to the AI when you&rsquo;re playing solo D&amp;D with it, you can start to understand how it thinks. I walk through how to use MCP Server tools to enhance solo roleplaying with Claude (and ChatGPT, etc.) and how to get extra information about how the AI is thinking. Also, I show you how to do logging despite the weird setup Claude Desktop requires.</p>
<p>More generally, you get to see why doing more documentation is important for agentic tools like Model Context Protocol. You have to shift from thinking like a programmer making APIs to thinking like a prompt engineer having a conversation with the AI.</p>
<p>I use Spring AI&rsquo;s Model Context Protocol support to write these tools in Java.</p>

<br/>
The ambitious timeline would require Apple to double its current iPhone production capacity in India. It marks a major acceleration of Apple's supply chain diversification strategy, which has been gradually expanding in recent years.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently, the majority of iPhones are manufactured in China through partners like Foxconn. The U.S. market accounts for approximately 28 percent of Apple's global iPhone shipments, which totaled 232.1 million units in 2024, according to International Data Corporation.

The Apple Watch Series 11 doesn't sound like it's going to be a groundbreaking anniversary device, but Apple could surprise us.

<br/>
According to YouTube, the video results carousel will use AI to highlight clips from videos that "will be most helpful for your search query," which essentially means that it will take clips from videos and play them right in results, so people may not need to click into a video to find the information they're looking for.

Google uses AI overviews for Google Search, but the YouTube version will differ. AI won't summarize videos, and will simply pull clips from them. It is not clear the AI-selected clips will encourage users to watch a full video, or cause fewer peo [...]<br>

<br/>
When Threads launched in 2023, Meta did not own Threads.com, so it was located at Threads.net. Meta acquired Threads.com in September 2024, and since then, the Threads.com domain forwarded to Threads.net. Going forward, users who type Threads.net into a browser window will be forwarded to Threads.com.

To accompany the name change, Threads on the web is getting several interface updates to make browsing through posts on the social network easier.

According to Netflix, nearly half of all viewing hours on the streaming service in the U.S. happen with the subtitles or captions on, which is why it is debuting the new setting.

The new option will show subtitles for dialogue, but no audio cues such as [phone buzzing], [door slams], or [fireplace crackling], which are normally shown when closed captioning is turned on.
