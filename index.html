            <b>Published:</b> 2024-08-26 08:31:30-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple in iOS 18 has made a wealth of customization options available for your iPhone Home Screen, one of which is the ability to add a tint to your app icons.  
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957459" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iOS-18-Home-Screen-Feature-1.5.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Essentially, the tint feature offers a unique way to customize your device's appearance by changing the color of all your icons at once. Unlike individual icon customization, tinting affects every icon on your app pages, Home Screen, and App Library, creating a unified look across your entire interface.
<br/>
<br/>
Tinting works by first desaturating all icons and then applying a single color overlay. This process results in a monochromatic appearance, which means you'll lose the original colors of your app icons and widgets, but what you gain is a more cohesive look. It's a powerful tool for creating a coordinated, stylish interface that reflects your [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            All of Apple's upcoming new Macs this year are likely to have at least 16GB of RAM pre-installed as standard, breaking a years-long tradition of Apple offering just 8GB of RAM in most of its base Macs and forcing customers to pay out an extra $200+ for additional memory.

The debate traces back to 2012 when Apple introduced the first Retina MacBook Pro with 8GB RAM as standard.
