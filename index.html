            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) at the cluster level has been supported by the Oracle database for many years and has become a requirement of many security specifications and best practices. 
The Oracle <a class="txt2html" href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/12.2/asoag/introduction-to-transparent-data-encryption.html#GUID-769EC29B-0107-40FE-9A9D-BF81A4BBD0E9" style="text-decoration: none;">documentation</a> lists two
practical advantages of the feature:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Encrypted storage which protects data in case of storage media theft
  </li><li>Regulatory compliance
</li></ul>
<p>Interestingly, it does not mention increased protection from data being accessed by database users, database superusers, or operating system users, and that is because it has limited value in protecting
such access.  It does also automatically encrypt file system backups, and provides encrypted storage in environments where the installation of operating system-level encryption is impossible.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            All four iPhone 16 models will be equipped with A18-branded chips, according to Jeff Pu, an analyst who covers Apple and its supply chain. He <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-16-lineup-a18-a18-pro-chips-analyst-says/">first shared this prediction last month</a>, and he touched on the topic again in a research note this week with Hong Kong-based investment firm Haitong International Securities.

<br/>
In his latest note, Pu said "we expect all iPhone 16 models to feature A18," and he expects the chips to be manufactured with chipmaker TSMC's second-generation 3nm process "N3E." Pu referred to the A17 Pro chip in the iPhone 15 Pro models, based on TSMC's first-generation 3nm process "N3B," as a "transition design."

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple plans to start implementing generative AI technology on the iPhone and iPad in late 2024 at the earliest, according to Jeff Pu, an analyst who covers Apple's supply chain for Hong Kong-based investment firm Haitong International Securities.

<br/>
In a research note on Wednesday, Pu said his supply chain checks suggest that Apple is likely to build a few hundred AI servers in 2023, and significantly more next year. He believes Apple will offer a combination of cloud-based AI and so-called "edge AI," which involves more on-device data processing. He added that patience will be required with Apple's rollout of generative AI, as the company considers how to use and process personal data in a way that aligns with its commitment to customer privacy.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Netflix today said  that it is increasing the cost of some of its subscription plans in the United States, the UK, and France. Prices will be going up for the Basic and Premium plans in those three countries.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
In the United States, the price of the Basic plan will increase from $9.99 to $11.99 per month, while the price of the Premium plan will increase from $19.99 to $22.99 per month. The ad-supported tier price will remain the same at $6.99 per month, as will the $15.49/month Standard plan.

Netflix no longer offers the Basic plan to new subscribers in the United States, but prices will presumably increase for existing subscribers.

Monos offers the Metro Backpack in nylon and vegan leather finishes in a variety of colors. I chose the vegan leather option in a Saddle Tan color, which is regularly priced at $230 in the U.S., but has occasionally gone on sale for less.

Apple does not provide details on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware, so it is unclear what's new.
