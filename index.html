<p id="37DA8M">When OpenAI announced other people could build their own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23948957/openai-chatgpt-gpt-custom-developer-platform">custom versions of ChatGPT-style chatbots</a>, I was initially only interested in a journalistic way. I knew this was an interesting commercial step for OpenAI, but the value of the store is still an open question. Why should I use most GPTs (as the bots are called), when I can usually call up an app that does the same thing? But I can’t deny there’s one incredibly useful bot that’s changed a (small) part of my work life for the better. It’s called “What’s Another Word For,” and I made it myself.</p>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-01-25 05:00:00-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Security researcher Tommy Mysk has demonstrated that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> push notifications are being used by popular apps to covertly send data about the user. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-778674" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/iPhone-12-Security-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
In a new video outlining the practice, Mysk highlighted how certain iOS apps exploit a feature introduced in iOS 10 that is designed to allow apps to customize push notifications. This feature, initially intended to enable apps to enrich notifications with additional content or decrypt encrypted messages, has seemingly been repurposed by some developers for more secretive activities. According to Mysk's findings, various popular applications, including TikTok, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Bing, are using the short background execution time granted for notification customization to send analytics information.
