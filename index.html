<br/>
As listed on Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/watch/compare/">specifications page</a>, all versions of the ‌Apple Watch Series 9‌ and ‌Apple Watch Ultra‌ 2 feature twice as much storage as their predecessors. The increase offers substantially more space for apps and media, and is presumably related to the all-new S9 chip, which brings significant performance and efficiency improvements to the Apple Watch.
<br/>
<br/>
The original Apple Watch, Series 2, and Series 3, had just 8GB of storage, increasing to 16GB on the Apple Watch Series 4. The Apple W [...]<br>

            Ahead of the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, there were rumors that said both devices would see a price increase.

<br/>
Apple did not change the price of the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌, and it is still priced starting at $999 for 128GB of storage. 
<br/>
<br/>
The ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max is priced starting at $1,199, but that's only because Apple has eliminated the 128GB storage tier for that device. It now starts at 256GB, and $1,199 is the same price Apple charged for the 256GB <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a> Max.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            While the new standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are equipped with a USB-C port, data transfer over a cable remains limited to USB 2.0 speeds of up to 480 Mbps, which is equal to the Lightning port on previous iPhones. Apple confirmed this detail in its tech specs for the devices posted on the company's website.

<br/>
The higher-end iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are also equipped with a USB-C port, but those devices support USB 3 data transfer speeds of up to 10 Gbps over a cable. Unlike recent iPad Pro models, this means that the Pro models unfortunately do not support Thunderbolt, which theoretically supports speeds up to 40 Gbps.

This comes contrary to a multitude of rumors prior to Apple's event, which suggested that the major efficiency improvements of the S9 and A17 chips would bring battery life improvements. The approximate battery life of each of the new devices Apple unveiled today is as follows:
