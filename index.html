            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple last week replaced the M3 Max <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> with the new M4 Max ‌MacBook Pro‌, and we picked up one of the new high-end ‌MacBook Pro‌ machines to see how it compares to the prior model with both benchmarks and real-world tests.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
We tested an M4 Max with a 16-core CPU, 40-core GPU, and 48GB RAM against an M3 Max ‌MacBook Pro‌ with similar specs. The two machines look similar, but the display on the M4 version did get some improvements and it's a little bit brighter. There's an option for nano-texture too, which makes a big difference if you ever work outside.
<br/>
<br/>
Thunderbolt 5 ports instead of Thunderbolt 4 ports allow you to connect more displays (up to three 6K displays) and get faster transfer speeds. Unsurprisingly, the M4 Max performed better across the board on benchmarks, and those higher numbers did indeed translate to actual improvements in day- [...]<br>

The Battery section displays a <strong>Slow Charger</strong> message when your iPhone detects a "slow" charger in use. You'll also see charging periods with an orange bar. This visual indicator appears in both the 24-hour and 10-day battery usage views.

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Compared to the prior version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, the M4 model is densely packed with little space between components, which is how Apple slimmed down the size so much. The ‌M4 Mac mini‌ measures in at 5x5 inches, down from 7.5x7.5 inches, a size reduction that makes a major difference.

<br/>
The power supply module is a board that extends across the top of the case, a design that Apple has previously used for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>. The power supply normally takes up a lot of space, so that's how Apple shrunk it down without compromising performance.
