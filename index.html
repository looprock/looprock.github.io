When the 80% hard limit is enabled, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> will never charge beyond that percentage, except on rare occasions to "maintain accurate battery state-of-charge estimates," according to Apple. Apple says reducing the time that a battery is fully charged can reduce the wear on the battery and improve its lifespan.

<p id="1mSXJX">A week after introducing a redesigned, sleeker app that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151704/sonos-new-app-bad-reviews-missing-features">omitted many core features</a>, Sonos held an Ask Me Anything event <a href="https://en.community.sonos.com/events-at-sonos-229141/sonos-app-redesign-ama-6893676">on its forums today</a>. The purpose was partly to make it clear that customer frustrations are being heard. But as has been the case since last week, the feedback skewed overwhelmingly negative. This company’s community remains pretty damn angry over losing software capabilities like local music search, sleep timers, and more with no warning.</p>

According to Google, Android has been designed with AI at its core, and Gemini is a foundational part of the Android experience that works at the system level. There is an AI powered search bar that can be used for answering queries and looking up information, and the Circle to Search feature can be used for solving math and physics problems or getting homework help as of today.

Apple just last week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-announces-ipad-air-models-in-new-11-13-inch/">announced</a> its latest ‌iPad Air‌ models powered by the company's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip. The two new 11-inch and 13-inch models replaced the previous M1-powered 10.9-inch ‌iPad Air‌, which was released in 2022. Apple also just announced new M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models that were until recently expected to feature the M3 chip.

            Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-announces-new-ipad-pro/">latest iPad Pro</a> is the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/08/ipod-nano-appears-in-new-ipad-pro-ad/">thinnest device the company has ever made</a>... but does it bend? That's likely to be the question on the mind of anyone who remembers the last iPad Pro "bendgate" controversy.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's latest iPad Air and iPad Pro models feature a new Battery Health menu in the Settings app that is not available on older iPads, and which includes options that were once limited to iPhone 15 models.

<br/>
As confirmed by <em><a href="https://www.iculture.nl/nieuws/batterijconditie-ipads-2024/">iCulture</a></em>, visiting Settings ➝ Battery on the new iPads shows a new Battery Health menu that lists Battery Health (with a readout such as "Normal"), Maximum Capacity, Cycle Count, and a 80% Limit charging optimization option.
