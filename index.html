            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            AI startup Rabbit today announced the launch of <a href="https://www.rabbit.tech">the Rabbit r1</a>, a mobile device that's designed to simplify the experience of using a smartphone. The r1 runs rabbit OS, an operating system powered by a Large Action Model (LAM).

<br/>
The Large Action Model is able to learn how humans use computers, or more specifically, how r1 users take advantage of apps. Rabbit says that the r1 can understand complex user intentions, operate user interfaces, and perform actions on behalf of the user. The OS was trained on data from people interacting with apps, allowing the r1 to do tasks like ordering pizza, booking ride services, playing music, communicating with people, and more, through voice commands.

            Apple has a detailed plan for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> reviews, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1744774909262483693"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. YouTubers and members of the media selected for reviews will meet with Apple on January 16 for a hands-on experience, with a follow-up meeting to take place on January 23 to go over the device's features a second time.

Reviews are set to be published at the end of January, which is just ahead of when Apple plans to launch the Vision Pro.

It is no surprise that Apple plans to have a firm hold on the review process and the experience that reviewers undergo, as it has kept headsets provided to developers similarly locked down.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>As of this writing, I know of three ways to make use of the incremental backup feature that I committed near the end of last month. I'll be interested to see how people deploy in practice. The first idea is to replace some of the full backups you're currently doing with incremental backups, saving backup time and network transfer. The second idea is to do just as many full backups as you do now, but add incremental backups between them, so that if you need to do PITR, you can use <span style="font-family: courier;">pg_combinebackup</span> to reach the latest incremental backup before the point to which you want to recover, reducing the amount of WAL that you need to replay, and probably speeding up the process quite a bit. The third idea is to give up on taking full backups altogether and only ever take incremental backups.</p><span></span><a href="https://rhaas.blogspot.com/2024/01/incremental-backups-evergreen-and-other.html#more">Read more »</a><br>
