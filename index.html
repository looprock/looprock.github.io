            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>\
Cryptocurrencies and hacks have gone hand in hand since the dawn of this industry. And honestly, this doesn’t come as a surprise. As the combined digital asset market capitalization <strong><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/">remains</a></strong> over $1.15 trillion, it is a sector with ludicrous opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit.</p>
<p>\
What should really concern us is that hackers are back and are more hungry than ever. In just Q2 2023, hacks and exploits <strong><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-hacks-and-exploits-snatch-over-300m-in-q2-2023-report">caused</a></strong> more than $300 million worth of damage. According to Chainalysis, 2022 was the best-ever year for crypto hackers, as the total value hacked <strong><a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-biggest-year-ever-for-crypto-hacking/">reached</a></strong> an all-time high at $3.8 billion, up 15% from 2021's $3.3 billion.</p>

            This section offers a legal perspective on crypto asset trading platforms, including those like Binance Platforms. It explains their role as central depositories, their handling of customer orders, and their differences from traditional securities markets. These platforms, unlike registered national securities exchanges, often do not segregate customer assets and perform roles similar to broker-dealers, sometimes without adequate disclosure of their trading practices, which can impact customers negatively. Understanding these complexities is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto asset trading space.<br>

            This section explores the vital role of consensus mechanisms in blockchain technology. Consensus mechanisms help blockchains agree on transaction validity and ledger updates. Two major mechanisms, "proof of work" and "proof of stake," are explained. "Proof of work," used by Bitcoin, involves solving complex math problems to mine blocks and earn crypto rewards. "Proof of stake," used by Ethereum, selects validators based on staked crypto assets. Understanding these mechanisms is key to comprehending how blockchain networks validate transactions.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            This section provides valuable insights into crypto assets and blockchain technology. Crypto assets, often referred to as cryptocurrencies or digital coins, are issued and transferred using blockchain or distributed ledger technology. Blockchain is a secure, decentralized database spread across a network of computers that records unchangeable transaction data. Some crypto assets are native to specific blockchains, while others can exist on multiple blockchains. Owners manage crypto assets using crypto wallets, which store public and private keys. The public key acts as a user's blockchain address, while the private key functions as a password to transfer assets. The security of these assets depends on the type of wallet, with "hot wallets" connected to the internet being more vulnerable to certain hacks than "cold wallets" disconnected from the internet. Understanding these fundamentals is crucial in the world of crypto trading.<br>

            In the ongoing case of SEC vs. Binance, this segment delves into the statutory and legal framework crucial for the proper functioning of U.S. securities markets. The SEC emphasizes the importance of separate registration for exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearing agencies to minimize conflicts and protect investors from manipulation and fraud. Broker-dealers, acting on behalf of investors, must become members of national securities exchanges and adhere to FINRA's rules. Registered intermediaries are subject to rigorous record-keeping and inspection requirements to ensure fair and transparent operations in the securities markets, with a focus on protecting investor assets and rights.

While it&#8217;s always nice to see the First Amendment protect speech we like, it&#8217;s just as likely to protect speech we don&#8217;t like. And harassment laws are often written far more broadly than they should be, given the First Amendment [&#8230;]<br>

The Persona is a digital representation of the user, with Apple using the headset's cameras to recreate the face and hands. While the ‌FaceTime‌ call is ongoing, the Persona is able to make the same facial expressions and hand movements as the user, so that ‌FaceTime‌ calls feel more like a person-to-person interaction.

Speed. Performance. Responsiveness. These ideals reign supreme in the world of web development, especially JavaScript and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en?ref=jsdevjournal.com">Nodejs</a>. A slow or janky website is the hallmark of an amateur, while a slick, optimized experience delights users and sets professionals apart.</p>
<p>\
But creating truly high-performance web apps is littered with pitfalls. Mistakes abound that can drag down the pace of your <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/javascript">JavaScript</a> without you even realizing it. Tiny oversights that bloat your code and surreptitiously sap speed away bit by bit.</p>
<p>\
You vigilantly minify your code and leverage caching…yet your site still feels oddly sluggish at times. The UI stutters during scrolling or when buttons are clicked. Pages take eons to load.</p>

What's going on?</p>

Turns out, there are many common ways we inadvertently slow down our JavaScript. Anti-patterns that, over time, can hobble site performance.</p>

            The Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (TDPSA) is set to take effect on July 1, 2024, making Texas the latest state to implement robust consumer data protection laws.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The new iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max all support DisplayPort for up to 4K HDR video mirroring and video output to an external display or TV, according to Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-15-pro/specs/">tech specs</a> for the devices.

<br/>
DisplayPort support is built into the USB-C port on all iPhone 15 models, meaning that the devices can output video at up to 4K/60Hz natively to a DisplayPort-equipped external display or TV with a supported USB-C to DisplayPort cable. Alternatively, you can use Apple's $69 <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUF82AM/A/usb-c-digital-av-multiport-adapter">USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter</a> to mirror video from any iPhone 15 to an HDMI-equipped TV or display at up to 4K/60Hz, but HDR is not supported this way.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The new iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are equipped with a customizable Action button that replaces the traditional mute switch on previous iPhones. By default, the button is set to toggle between Ring and Silent modes, but it can also be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-action-button-everything-it-can-do/">assigned to a different action</a> for quick access to the camera, flashlight, Voice Memos, and more.

<br/>
One of the options for the Action button will be the Translate app, allowing you to quickly start translating between two languages without having to open the app. However, fine print on Apple's website says the Translate option will not be available for the Action button until later this year, suggesting that it will be enabled in a future iOS 17 update.
