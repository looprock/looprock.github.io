<br/>
The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max weigh 206 grams and 240 grams, respectively, according to Apple's tech specs for the devices.

And yet the garrulity of old age, and the aptitude of a man's mind to recur to the passages of his own life, will, I know, tempt me to say something of myself;—nor, without doing so, should I know how to throw my matter into any recognised and intelligible form.
