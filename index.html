            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple introduced a new version of the Vision Pro with M5 chip this week, and it came with <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/DUAL_KNIT_BAND_SA/apple-vision-pro-dual-knit-band">a Dual Knit Band</a> that Apple says is more comfortable to wear for long periods of time.

It appears ‌M2‌ Vision Pro owners are eager for an accessory that makes the headset easier to wear, because the $99 Dual Knit Band is now backordered for at least a month. As of yesterday, new Dual Knit Band orders were delivering between November 7 and November 14, and wait times could get even longer.

            A month before Apple introduced the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> lineup, Google debuted its new Pixel 10 smartphone line.

With Apple adopting a camera "plateau" instead of a camera bump, the camera setup for the two smartphones looks more similar than ever before. Google has used a pill-shaped multi-lens horizontal camera bar for several years now, and now Apple uses a design that's not too far off. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a>'s camera bump is wider, more square shaped, and it still has all three lenses on the left side, while Google's bar has rounded corners and lenses positioned in a row.
