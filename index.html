            Apple has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=ks775ehf">announced</a> an overhaul of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>'s age rating system across all of its platforms.

The company has added three new age rating tiers — 13+, 16+, and 18+ — to the existing 4+ and 9+ classifications. At the same time, the 12+ and 17+ categories are being removed.

iPhone Upgrade Program members receive AppleCare+ with Theft and Loss coverage as part of their monthly payment, but they can switch to AppleCare One if they prefer. It might be possible to save a bit of money by doing so.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-07-24 23:10:56-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If you've just downloaded the iOS 26 public beta on your iPhone, the first thing you'll notice is the new Liquid Glass design overhaul, which adopts translucent elements throughout the system interface and in stock apps. 
<br/>
<br/>
On the Home Screen, the search bar, dock, and app folders are translucent. By default, app icons have a new layered glass look that gives them dimension, but there's also a new option for "Clear" glass-like icons. This setting turns your app icons transparent, and widgets too. So if you want the full glass effect, read on.

<br/>
In iOS 18, Apple introduced Dark Mode and Tinted app icons. With iOS 26 and iPadOS 26, Apple adds a third visual style – Clear – that removes the color from app icons and widgets, and applies reflective, translucent effects to make them appear see-through.
