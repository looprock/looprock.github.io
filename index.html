You may argue that this tracing is excessive and that LLMs have nothing in common with the old-fashioned prehistoric computer systems. You may also argue that LLMs are based on real, hard-core deep learning. However, deep learning itself originated in 1943, when the first ancestor of the artificial neural model was proposed by McCulloch and Pitts. Exactly 60 years ago!

Second, your sleek Apple MacBook Pro would need upwards of 270 million billion years to match a 70-qubit Quantum Computer at Random Circuit Sampling. Of course, Frontier (see below), not a MacBook Pro, is the ultimate classical computing beast on the planet. But despite its 1.1 Quintillion Hz CPU and GPU processors, it would still need … take a guess … 47 years to beat a 70 qubit Sycamore chip.


What a beautiful intersection of time to be at.<br>
