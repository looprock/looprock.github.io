            As Walled Culture has often noted, the process of framing new copyright laws is&#160;tilted&#160;against the public in multiple ways. And on the rare occasions when a government makes some mild concession to anyone outside the copyright industry, the latter invariably rolls out its highly-effective lobbying machine to fight against such measures.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>

It is not unusual that iOS 17.1.1 and iOS 17.1.2 are no longer being signed. Apple routinely stops signing older versions of iOS after new releases in order to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date and to prevent users from downgrading to older, less secure versions of the software.

As noted by <em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-testflight-servers-from-2012-to-2015-leak-containing-terabytes-of-data">Eurogamer</a></em>, a huge number of TestFlight files were found archived on Wayback Machine and were shared anonymously on X, previously known as Twitter.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Alongside iOS 17.2.1, Apple today released iOS 16.7.4 and iPadOS 16.7.4 updates that fix an issue with built-in apps. In some cases, if a user deleted a built-in Apple app on a device running iOS or iPadOS 16.7.3 or earlier, the app would not be able to be reinstalled.

<br/>
From Apple's release notes for the update:<blockquote>This update fixes an issue where built-in Apple apps that may have been deleted may not reinstall.</blockquote>While we haven't heard many complaints about the issue, that is likely because the majority of users have transitioned over to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>. For those who are having a problem with reinstalling a deleted app in iOS 16 or iPadOS 16, the new update will address the problem.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today introduced a new firmware update for the third-generation AirPods. The new firmware is version 6A317, up from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-releases-new-airpods-firmware-2/">6A300 firmware</a> introduced in September.

<br/>
Apple's AirPods firmware updates do not come with details on new features, so it is unclear what might be included in the software.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple also does not offer instructions on how to upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ are connected to an iOS device. Putting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ in the case, connecting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to a power source, and then pairing the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to an iOS device or Mac should force the update.

            Back in 2017 the FCC tried to pass some very basic privacy protections for broadband access. The rules simply demanded transparency as to what kind of data your ISP collects and sells. They also mandated that the trafficking of sensitive financial data by telecoms require the opt in consent of consumers. Telecom giants like AT&#38;T [&#8230;]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In macOS Sonoma 14.2, Apple included some additional controls for Shazam music recognition, which is now baked into the Mac operating system more than ever. Here's how to add the functionality to your Mac's menu bar and Control Center.

<br/>
For those unfamiliar with Shazam, it's an Apple-owned popular service that can identify the names and lyrics of songs, music videos, TV shows, and more, simply by listening to and deciphering whatever is playing. 
<br/>
<br/>
After years of ‌‌Siri‌‌ integration, Apple acquired Shazam in 2018, and integrated it into iOS and iPadOS as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-shazam-without-downloading-app/">system-level song recognition function</a>. With macOS 14.2, the same level of integration has finally come to Mac.
