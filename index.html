McCuskey says that Apple has opted to "do nothing about it" for years.

<blockquote>"Preserving the privacy of child predators is absolutely inexcusable. And more importantly, it violates West Virginia law.

The original project involved plans to release three different camera-equipped watch models, but it doesn't sound like they will be part of the company's future product lineup. The new watch is code-named "Malibu 2."

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iPhone development roadmap runs several years into the future and the company is continually working with suppliers on several successive iPhone models at the same time, which is why we often get rumored features months ahead of launch. The iPhone 18 series is no different, and we already have a good idea of what to expect for the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max.

<br/>
One thing worth noting is that Apple is reportedly planning a major change to its iPhone release cycle this year, adopting a two-phase rollout starting with the iPhone 18 series. That means the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and iPhone Fold will be released in September 2026, followed by the iPhone 18 and iPhone 18e in spring 2027.

            <p>Your Boss Doesn’t Know What to Do With AI</p>
<p>Enterprise AI Has a Product-Market Fit Problem. Enterprise AI isn’t stalled because the models are weak. It’s stalled because we haven’t discovered product-market fit inside the enterprise yet.</p>
<p>You don’t find real AI value by theorizing in workshops. You find it by running experiments for months inside your actual systems - against real data - in a governed environment.</p>
<p>That requires a platform.</p>
<p>Without one, AI pilots turn into disconnected experiments, shadow infrastructure, and compliance risk. With one, experimentation compounds into institutional learning.</p>
<p>In this video, I break down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why enterprise AI is still in discovery mode</li>
<li>Why experimentation must be long-running, not one-off</li>
<li>How governance enables innovation instead of blocking it</li>
<li>Why a secure platform foundation is the baseline for AI ROI</li>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Iteration has long been one of the more fragmented areas of Go, with developers relying on ad hoc patterns to traverse custom data structures. This article explores the range-over-functions experiment, a proposed evolution of the language that introduces a standardized iterator model while preserving Go&rsquo;s familiar for range syntax. Using the new iter package and sequence abstractions, it shows how iteration logic can be expressed more clearly, flexibly, and idiomatically. Originally published in April 2024, the concepts remain highly relevant as Go continues to evolve toward more expressive yet simple language features.</p><br>

            <p>Internal development teams and executives are increasingly looking at AI to automate the creation of internal developer platforms. However, cobbling together open-source components with AI is a far cry from building a scalable, secure, and &ldquo;enterprise-grade&rdquo; environment. In this conversation, we explore why betting your internal infrastructure on AI-generated platforms is a high-stakes risk and why human-led architecture still dictates the long-term success of a platform.</p>
