The app is powered by Sunbird, an unofficial iMessage client that debuted last year with over 10,000 downloads on the Google Play Store. To use the Nothing Chats app with iMessage, users will need to log in with their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a>.

            Next year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> could feature a more power-efficient display thanks to a new OLED material set that is reportedly being developed by Samsung specifically for Apple.

<br/>
A material set includes a variety of components for OLED screens, such as capping layers (CPL), which adjust the optical characteristics of the screen. Each component is produced by a specialist manufacturer and supplied to Samsung, which then uses them to construct the final OLED panel. 
<br/>
<br/>
A different composition of materials in the set can alter attributes of the OLED panel, such as lifespan, brightness, color accuracy, or manufacturing efficiency.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When Meta launched Threads in July, one of the complaints users had about the platform was that it was impossible to delete your Threads profile <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/06/deleting-threads-profile-also-deletes-instagram/">without also deleting your Instagram account</a>.

<br/>
Up until now, the only alternative was to "temporarily" deactivate your Threads profile. This option makes your posts and interactions with others invisible on the platform, but it leaves your posts on Meta's servers unless you go through them and manually delete them one by one.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple introduced the Lightning port in September 2012 with the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 5. The connector was a significant change from the previous 30-pin connector used in Apple devices, offering a smaller, more efficient connection that could be inserted either way up, enhancing ease of use.

<br/>
In September 2023, over a decade later, Apple caught up with the rest of the industry and removed the Lightning port from its flagship <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> series, replacing it with USB-C, the widely adopted standard used in electronics for connectivity and charging.

Sources familiar with the matter speaking to the <em>Korea Herald</em> claim that LG Display is set to initiate OLED production for the new ‌iPad Pro‌ as early as February next year at their facility in Paju, Gyeonggi Province – a time frame around three months sooner than previously expected. The displays are expected to be three times the price of those used in iPhones, which <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/09/2024-oled-ipad-pro-starting-prices/">could translate to higher prices</a> for customers.
