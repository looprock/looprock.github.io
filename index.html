            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In computing lore, an Easter egg typically refers to a secret message, image, or feature intentionally left in software, often (but not always) hidden in plain sight. Since the 1970s, programmers have used them to credit unheralded developers, reference pop culture, sneak games into productivity apps, and generally inject a little bit of humanity into their code.

When Apple was a fledgling company, Mac developers regularly left fun little Easter eggs in software, but not so much these days. While surprises can still be found, they are a lot more subtle and sober, and exist more as a nod and wink to Apple's origins rather than anything edgy or unauthorized. Here are some of our favorite remaining Easter eggs in macOS.

Apple Watch fast charging was introduced with the Apple Watch Series 7 in 2021, enabling devices to charge rapidly from 0 percent to 80 percent in about 45 minutes. Apple apparently had shortages of the newer charging module at first, forcing some MFi accessory makers to use the older, slower technology. Going forward, Apple is focusing on production of fast-charging modules only.
