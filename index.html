Called the Core 2 Duo and the Core Time 2, the two smartwatches run a PebbleOS, which is based on the source code for the software that ran on the original Pebble smartwatch.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Have you noticed your iPhone videos keep playing on repeat in the Photos app? Since Apple's iOS 18.2 update, the stock Photos app automatically replays videos until you manually pause them – a feature that might be fine at first but can quickly become annoying, especially with longer clips.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-897381" height="470" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/icloud-photos.jpg" width="836"/>
<br/>
The auto-loop feature can be fun for short clips or when showing someone a quick video, but it forces you to take action to stop each video rather than letting it end naturally. It can be disruptive when you're browsing through multiple short clips in your library, and proves particularly annoying when viewing longer content where you likely don't want to see the same three-minute video play twice in a row.
<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, Apple provides a simple toggle to disable the behavior:
