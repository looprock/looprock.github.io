            Disney plans to start cracking down on Disney+ password sharing starting in June, Disney CEO Bob Iger said in an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/04/04/disney-ceo-bob-iger-on-streaming-we-have-to-turn-it-into-a-growth-business.html">interview with <em>CNBC</em></a> earlier this week.

"In June, we'll be launching our first real foray into password sharing," said Iger. "Just a few countries and a few markets, but then it will grow significantly with a full rollout in September."
