<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950742" height="1265" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/m4-iPad-Pro-Horizontal-Feature-Purple-Triad.jpg" width="2250"/>
<br/>
When the 80% hard limit is enabled, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> will never charge beyond that percentage, except on rare occasions to "maintain accurate battery state-of-charge estimates," according to Apple. Apple says reducing the time that a battery is fully charged can reduce the wear on the battery and improve its lifespan.
