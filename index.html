            <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>First, I’d like to sincerely thank everyone who has supported Highscalability over the years.</p>
<p>We’ve grown together through some interesting times. Massive changes have occurred in how systems are built, and my goal has always been to help people learn how to build them better. I’d like to think that goal was accomplished.</p>
<p>Obviously, for that last several years, things have been quiet around here. This has always been a one programmer show, and for everything, there is a season. The season for me is changing. That means http://highscalability.com is for sale.</p>
<p>My preference is for someone to take HS over and keep it going in some form or another. If you are a content farm, please don’t reply. I’ve never once taken payment for a post and I don’t plan on changing that now.</p>
<p>You get the site, the domain, and the twitter account. If you are not a scam artist and have a reasonable offer, please contact me at toddhoffious@gmail</p> [...]<br>

            As is the case any time surveillance powers are up for renewal, there&#8217;s always a chance to reform them.

<br/>
Apple originally said the feature was "coming later this year," but it now says it will be "coming in an update in 2024." Apple did not provide a more specific timeframe, but the feature should be added in an iOS 17 update in the first half of next year.

The feature will allow iPhone users to scan a QR code on their hotel room TV to establish an AirPlay connection, allowing them to wirelessly stream videos, photos, and music from their iPhone to the TV. Google already offers a similar feature on some hotel TVs, allowing guests to stream content from their smartphone via Chromecast.
