            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-28 14:08:35-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's next MacBook Pro models will enter mass production soon, according to the latest information shared by <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974025" height="2160" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-MacBook-Pro-M4-hero.jpg" width="3840"/>

In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-28/apple-s-chatgpt-rival-m5-macbook-air-new-monitor-timing-ads-coming-to-maps-mg3ne6rw"><em>Power On</em> newsletter today</a>, Gurman said he continues to believe the new MacBook Pro models will be released at some point between late 2025 and the first quarter of 2026, meaning they should be available to order by March at the latest.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple often releases new Macs in October, but both Gurman and Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously said the next MacBook Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/10/no-m5-macbook-pro-2025/">might not arrive until early 2026</a>. Apple ann [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-28 13:30:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is preparing to release iOS 26.0.1, according to a private account on X with a proven track record of sharing information about future iOS versions.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020170" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/iOS-26.0.1-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
The account initially said iOS 26.0.1 would have a build number of 23A350, but they now expect the update to have a build number of 23A355. This suggests that the software update will include more bug fixes or changes than initially planned.
<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> has also seen evidence of iOS 26.0.1 in its visitor logs in recent days, as Apple's software engineers test the update internally.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26.0.1 will likely address a handful of software bugs and issues:<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/17/apple-iphone-17-camera-glitch-fix/">A camera-related bug</a> on the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro</li>

<p>It occurred to me, deep into a really won­derful experience, of reading and thinking and feeling and pondering, that if Wiz­ards of the Coast had pub­lished exactly the same mate­rial online — and you can imagine this easily: you can imagine the web­site, as slick as one of the Google Arts &amp; Culture sites, or the dig­ital book from the Steve Jobs Archive — I would have clicked over; said, “wow, cool”; then moved on to the next thing.</p>

            <p>Once you fix the bottleneck of coding, you face the all the other bottlenecks down the line. So, you have to think of how to apply AI, or whatever, to the rest of the SDLC processes. Some real theory of constraints stuff there.</p>

<p>PDFs - Always use LibreOffice to create the PDF (it must be LibreOffice! If LibreOffice is not installed, you can install it yourself). Other libraries sometimes show weird artifacts on some computers</p>

<li>Platform engineering for AI is mostly running another middleware service - same infrastructure tasks as always, plus model registries and figuring out who handles AI safety evaluations.</li>
<li>Put a gateway/proxy in the middle immediately - the eternal computing lesson we relearn every five years: never let developers talk directly to services or you’re stuck sending angry emails.</li>

            <p>Manton reviews ChatGPT Pulse: it might drive traffic to more websites, going around Google:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s something else about how this works that is fundamentally different than current chat-based AI where people are looking for answers. Instead of replacing a Google search, it’s adding opportunities to point to other websites and blogs. Because it’s proactively pushing stories to you that you may never think to look for, it should increase referrers to websites instead of subtracting them. Not enough to offset the lost Google searches, but still notable.</p>

And if they can’t quantify how it’ll help them … it’s not going to be a long discussion” over whether the software is worth paying for, Thompson said. // And: it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;challenge for businesses is that there’s this leap of faith moment where you try to justify it with the return-on-investment calculation, which is hard to figure out.&rdquo;</p>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-26 08:53:38-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, Apple Intelligence makes the Wallet app's order tracking feature genuinely useful by scanning your email for shipping details. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1013341" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/ios-26-beta-5-wallet-app.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
The ability to track orders in Apple Wallet isn't new – it's actually been around since iOS 16. But if you've never noticed it before, don't worry. Most people haven't used it either.
<br/>
<br/>
The feature initially struggled because it relied on merchants to actively support it, but not many bothered. In fact, despite being available for years, order tracking in Apple's Wallet app remained largely unused. But there's a decent chance iOS 26 will change all that.

In iOS 26, Apple Intelligence now scans your emails to automatically extract order tracking information. This means virtually any online purchase t [...]<br>

Apple's new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> lineup has been available for over a week, so we reflect on the devices now we've had some time to check them out. We discuss the radically thin and light design of the ‌iPhone Air‌, and what it really feels like to use the device. We look at its surprisingly impressive durability and battery life, as well as its drawbacks in terms of speakers and rear camera versatility.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, Apple has extended Visual Intelligence to work with content that's on your iPhone, allowing you to ask questions about what you're seeing, look up products, and more.

<br/>
Visual Intelligence started out in iOS 18.2 as a Camera Control button function that can describe what you are looking at, get details about a restaurant or business, translate text, and the like.
<br/>
<br/>
But in iOS 26, Visual Intelligence is no longer just for learning more about your physical surroundings. You can also use the feature to analyze content on your iPhone screen, simply by pressing the same buttons you use to take a screenshot.

You can search across apps, go straight to relevant websites, add an event to your calendar, and more. Keep reading to learn what you can do with it. Note that Visual Intelligence is an [...]<br>
