            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-20 08:04:09-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Earlier this week, the investment firm GF Securities shared multiple research notes regarding Apple's future chips. In one of these notes, it said the A20 chip for the iPhone 18 series would be manufactured <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/a20-chip-still-3nm-rumor/">with TSMC's third-generation 3nm process</a>, N3P, and in another it said that the chip would use TSMC's newer 2nm process N2.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
GF Securities is a large organization with many analysts, and it seems like some wires got crossed. In an email to <em>MacRumors</em>, the firm's lead Apple analyst Jeff Pu has since clarified that he believes the A20 chip will be manufactured with the N2 process, so the information about the chip using the N3P process should be disregarded.

            Security firm <a href="https://layerxsecurity.com/blog/layerx-identifies-new-phishing-campaign-targeted-at-mac-users/">LayerX Labs</a> has identified a sophisticated phishing campaign that recently began targeting Mac users after new browser protections rendered its Windows attacks less effective.

<br/>
The attackers had previously targeted Windows users with fake Microsoft security alerts, but then adapted their tactics in response to new anti-scareware features deployed in Chrome, Edge, and Firefox browsers earlier this year.
<br/>
<br/>
According to LayerX, the original campaign relied on compromised websites that would display fake security warnings claiming the user's computer had been "compromised" and "locked." The malicious code would then freeze the webpage, creating the illusion that the computer was locked and prompt [...]<br>

            Meta has <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/03/europe-meet-your-newest-assistant-meta-ai/">announced</a> the rollout of its AI chatbot across Europe starting this week.

<br/>
Meta AI launched in the United States in 2023, but the company paused a planned rollout in Europe due to regulatory concerns. Meta's AI suite of features offer users several capabilities, but Europe is only getting the text-based assistant in six languages for now. The company said it plans to "find parity with the US" and expand its AI offering over time.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 18.4 includes a new Safari feature that puts your searches front and center, showing your recent search history whenever you open up a new Safari tab and tap into the search field.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991973" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/ios-18-4-safari-search.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
When the feature first came out in the iOS 18.4 beta, there was no option to disable it, but Apple rectified that with the fourth beta update. In the Safari section of the Settings app, there is now a "Show Recent Searches" option that can be toggled off.
<br/>
<br/>
Disabling Show Recent Searches returns the Safari search interface to its iOS 18.3.2 behavior, where recent searches are not shown when tapping into the search window of a new tab.

<br/>
Apple appears to have added the option to toggle off the search feature after receiving feedback during the iOS 18.4 beta testing period.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Android smartphone maker Nothing recently came out with the Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro, just a little after Apple launched the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a>. Since Nothing's smartphone is targeting roughly the same group of smartphone buyers as the ‌iPhone 16e‌, we thought we'd do a comparison.

The ‌iPhone 16e‌ is priced at $599, which is higher than any other budget smartphone that Apple has released to date, while the <a href="https://us.nothing.tech/products/phone-3a-pro">3a Pro</a> is quite a bit more affordable at $459. The 3a Pro has some bells and whistles you won't get with the ‌iPhone 16e‌ like extra cameras and a larger display, but the Qualcomm chip in the 3a Pro really can't compete with the A18 in the ‌iPhone 16e‌.

            The European Commission today announced a <a href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/questions-and-answers/interoperability_en">long list of changes</a> that Apple is legally required to implement in future iOS 19 and iOS 20 updates.

<br/>
The announcement clarifies interoperability requirements that Apple is required to adhere to in the EU, under the Digital Markets Act, which has been fully enforced since March 2024. The changes will further open up the iPhone and its technologies to competing companies and devices, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/19/apple-eu-interoperability-bad-for-products-users/">Apple is really unhappy about it</a>.

As it turns out, the ‌iPhone 16e‌ performs almost as well or better than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> in many speed tests that compare sub-6GHz performance, but it does vary by network.
