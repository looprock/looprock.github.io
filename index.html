            <b>Summary:</b><br>

<br/>
We previously reported that the Powerbeats Pro 2 will offer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/powerbeats-pro-2-heart-rate/">heart rate monitoring during workouts</a>, and perhaps that feature will extend to AirPods in the future. Based on our iOS 18 code findings, you will be able to connect the Powerbeats Pro 2 to gym equipment like a treadmill to measure heart rate, and the data will be visible in the Health app and other supported apps on the iPhone.

Economic newspaper <em><a href="https://m.ajunews.com/view/20241111141006207">Ajunews</a></em> reports that LG Innotek will supply the front camera module for the budget-friendly fourth-generation device.

            Apple TV+ today shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceYm0eDw7tg">recap video</a> for the first season of "Silo. The hit series returns for a second season starting later this week.
<br/>
<br/>
Warning: The video contains major spoilers, obviously.

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
"Silo" follows the last 10,000 people on Earth, all of whom live in a massive underground bunker to escape the seemingly toxic and deadly world outside. The people are unaware of why the silo was built, and those who seek the truth face deadly consequences. Rebecca Ferguson stars as Juliette Nichols, an engineer who attempts to unravel the mysteries surrounding the silo following a loved one's murder. The sci-fi series is based on Hugh Howey's best-selling book trilogy "Wool." Ferguson and Howey both serve as executive producers.

The 10-episode second season of "Silo" begins this Friday, November 15, and one new episode will follow every Friday through January 17.

Somewhere I read that it's on Palantir's new employee reading list, which made me interested. The section on status is both weird and intriguing. It's very prescriptive - there's no "it depends."
