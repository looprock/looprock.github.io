            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Contract testing is a method for verifying system integration by individually examining each application to ensure that contracts and interfaces adhere to the agreed-upon alignment. A mock integration point enables the validation of a component’s expected behavior without reliance on that component.

In the case of a large and intricate application, it may be necessary to establish an integration point trusted by multiple applications. This trusted integration point’s behaviors are validated by all dependent applications, preventing inadvertent or malicious changes from impacting the entire system.

Thus, a system can be constructed in which each component performs a specific task, safeguarding the system against accidental or malicious alterations to any of its components.<br>

            Apple's upcoming iPhone 15 Pro models will likely be more expensive than the current models, according to Tim Long, an analyst at British bank Barclays. Long said this information is based on conversations with supply chain companies in Asia.

In a research note this month, obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>, Long said he expects the iPhone 15 Pro to cost up to $100 more than the iPhone 14 Pro, and the iPhone 15 Pro Max to be $100 to $200 more expensive than the iPhone 14 Pro Max. He believes pricing will remain similar for the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models.

Based on Long's estimates, pricing for the iPhone 15 lineup in the U.S. could be as follows:<ul><li><strong>iPhone 15:</strong> $799 (unchanged)</li>
