            Apple's next entry-level <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> is expected to gain the A18 chip, a change that appears modest on paper but would enable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> on the company's most affordable tablet for the first time.

<br/>
Apple last refreshed the entry-level ‌iPad‌ in March 2025, adding the A16 chip. ‌Apple Intelligence‌ is supported by devices with the A17 Pro or newer, or Apple's M-series chips, due to the processing, memory bandwidth, and neural engine performance required to run on-device and hybrid AI workloads. The A16 in the current entry-level ‌iPad‌ falls just short of this threshold, leaving the product outside Apple's AI rollout despite its relatively recent update.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/">macOS Tahoe</a> 26.4 beta that Apple released today includes a Charge Limit feature for the Mac. There is a new slider bar that lets Mac users select a charge level from 80 percent to 100 percent.

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036511" height="995" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/macos-26-4-charge-limit.jpg" width="1769"/>
<br/>
The Charge Limit is a setting that's available in addition to Optimized Battery Charging, and it can prevent a Mac from ever charging to 100 percent.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple's existing Optimized Battery Charging feature keeps a Mac from charging to 100 percent until it's needed for use, with the option using your daily charging routine to determine when to charge to full. While Optimized Battery Charging can help preserve battery life, it still regularly allows a Mac to charge to 100 percent.

The new Charge Limit feature is a hard restriction that keeps a Ma [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Iteration has long been one of the more fragmented areas of Go, with developers relying on ad hoc patterns to traverse custom data structures. This article explores the range-over-functions experiment, a proposed evolution of the language that introduces a standardized iterator model while preserving Go&rsquo;s familiar for range syntax. Using the new iter package and sequence abstractions, it shows how iteration logic can be expressed more clearly, flexibly, and idiomatically. Originally published in April 2024, the concepts remain highly relevant as Go continues to evolve toward more expressive yet simple language features.</p><br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Internal development teams and executives are increasingly looking at AI to automate the creation of internal developer platforms. However, cobbling together open-source components with AI is a far cry from building a scalable, secure, and &ldquo;enterprise-grade&rdquo; environment. In this conversation, we explore why betting your internal infrastructure on AI-generated platforms is a high-stakes risk and why human-led architecture still dictates the long-term success of a platform.</p>
