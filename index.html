<br/>
<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/web-search">Announced on Thursday</a>, the new feature enables Claude to search the internet for current events and information, so its accuracy should be significantly better when answering questions about recent developments.
<br/>
<br/>
When Claude uses web search to inform its responses, the interface provides clickable citations that allow you to verify sources and fact-check information, meaning you won't have to conduct separate searches.
<br/>

The feature is currently available only to paying subscribers in the United States. Anthropic says it plans to roll out web search to free users and addition [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 04:45:12-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Threads has just introduced several new features aimed at giving users more control over their experience and enhancing content discovery on the social media platform and X rival.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-902359" height="607" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/instagram-threads-app.jpg" width="1079"/>
<br/>
The update includes the ability to add up to ten "Topics" to your bio, which can be used to showcase your interests and connect with like-minded users. When someone visits your profile, the topics will be prominently displayed and can be tapped to view related conversations. Meta says this feature is a test, so it might not be around for ever.
<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, for content creators, Threads is now suggesting trending topics when drafting posts. According to Meta's internal data, posts with tagged topics generally receive more views than those without, so this could potentially offer a boost to creator reach and engagement.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 04:07:50-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Google is rolling out an improved Gmail search function powered by AI that the company <a href="https://blog.google/products/gmail/gmail-search-update-relevant-emails/">reckons</a> will "show you the most relevant results, faster."
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-854189" height="630" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/gmail-icon.png" width="1200"/>
<br/>
Search in Gmail has traditionally returned results from your inbox in chronological order based on keywords. That's not great if the email you need was sent months or years ago. 
<br/>
<br/>
What the new method does to improve things is factor in elements like how often you contact someone, which emails you've clicked the most, and how recently the emails arrived in your inbox.
<br/>
<br/>
"With this update, the emails you're looking for are far more likely to be at the top of your search results — saving you valuable time and helping you find important information more easily," claims Google.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 03:21:44-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple plans to use liquid metal in the hinges of its upcoming foldable iPhone to improve durability and reduce screen creasing, <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1902942517861159377">according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-995555" height="1266" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Foldable-iPhone-2023-Feature-Iridescent-1.jpg" width="2250"/>
<br/>
Apple has reportedly chosen liquid metal, which is manufactured using a die-casting process, as a key component in addressing common issues with foldable devices. The design choice aims to enhance screen flatness and minimize the crease marks that typically plague folding displays.
<br/>
<br/>
Kuo notes that Apple has previously used liquid metal in smaller components like SIM ejector pins, but the foldable iPhone will mark the company's first major use of the material in a critical mechanical part. Dongguan EonTec will reportedly be the exclusive supplier of liquid metal.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Earlier this week, the investment firm GF Securities shared multiple research notes regarding Apple's future chips. In one of these notes, it said the A20 chip for the iPhone 18 series would be manufactured <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/a20-chip-still-3nm-rumor/">with TSMC's third-generation 3nm process</a>, N3P, and in another it said that the chip would use TSMC's newer 2nm process N2.

<br/>
GF Securities is a large organization with many analysts, and it seems like some wires got crossed. In an email to <em>MacRumors</em>, the firm's lead Apple analyst Jeff Pu has since clarified that he believes the A20 chip will be manufactured with the N2 process, so the information about the chip using the N3P process should be disregarded.
