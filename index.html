            Eight years ago today, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/06/homepod-reinvents-music-in-the-home/">introduced the HomePod</a>, a smart speaker that it said would provide "amazing sound quality and intelligence" in the home.

"Apple reinvented portable music with iPod and now HomePod will reinvent how we enjoy music wirelessly throughout our homes," said Apple's former marketing chief Phil Schiller, in a June 2017 press release announcing the HomePod.

            The Apple Watch provides highly accurate measurements of heart rate and step count, but their estimates of calories burned can be significantly off, according to a new peer-reviewed meta-analysis conducted by researchers at the <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1086185">University of Mississippi</a> (via <em><a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/your-apple-watch-might-not-be-as-accurate-as-you-think-new-study-finds/">CNET</a></em>).

A favicon is a small icon that serves as a kind of badge for a website. Its main purpose is to make it easier to locate the webpage when there are multiple tabs open in a browser.
<br/>

Currently rolling out to a small number of WhatsApp beta testers is a new section in the app called "AI Studio," which walks users through the creation of their AI assistant.

The idea isn't dissimilar to OpenAI's custom GPTs or Google Gemini's Gems. Users can devise their AI's role, personality traits, specialisms, and style of discourse, and start chatting with them immediately after creation. Here's how <em>WABetaInfo</em> describes it:

            Apple appears to be moving to the next-generation Qi 2.2 wireless charging standard, according to regulatory filings on Taiwan's NCC certification website.

It's a notable upgrade mainly because of the faster charging speed. Qi 2.2 is technically capable of up to 50W charging output. In contrast, the Qi 2 standa [...]<br>

To deploy ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features in China, Apple is working with Alibaba, and the two companies have not yet received regulatory approval in China for the AI products that Apple wants to debut.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is rumored to be working on a smart home hub that has been nicknamed the "HomePad." The device is expected to have a square iPad-like screen that can be attached to a HomePod-like speaker base, or it can be mounted on a wall.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's Live Photos, introduced in 2015, are photos that capture 1.5 seconds of video before and after you take a picture, with the aim of adding a little bit of life and movement to still images. 
<br/>

<br/>
Since introducing Live Photos, Apple has added some effects to its Photos app that let you turn them into fun animated clips, which you can then share with family, friends, or the wider world. 
<br/>
<br/>
There are three effects in total that you can try on your own Live Photos. Loop repeats the action in a continuous looping video, Bounce rewinds the action backward and forward, and Long Exposure simulates a DSLR-like long exposure effect by blurring motion. 
<br/>
<br/>
The following steps show how you can apply them to your own Live Photos on iPhone and iPad.
