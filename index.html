            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Viewed together, three main facts indicate that Microsoft enjoys monopoly power. First, Microsoft’s share of the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems is extremely large and stable. Second, Microsoft’s dominant market share is protected by a high barrier to entry. Third, and largely as a result of that barrier, Microsoft’s customers lack a commercially viable alternative to Windows.<br>

            Just a few weeks ahead of Apple unveiling new iPhones, rumors continue to circulate about new color options for the devices. The latest information comes from established leakers <a href="https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1696145808196780032">@MajinBuOfficial</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/URedditor/status/1696146103547146555">@URedditor</a>, who today said the lower-end iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models will be available in a new light green finish.

@MajinBuOfficial said it appears the new color option will be very similar to the green finish available for the iPhone 12 and the discontinued iPhone 12 mini.
