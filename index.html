            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            While all Macs are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/17/apple-celebrates-five-years-of-m1-chip/">now powered by Apple's custom-designed chips</a>, a new rumor claims that Apple may rekindle its partnership with Intel, albeit in a new and limited way.

<br/>
Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1994422001952555318">said</a> Intel is expected to begin shipping Apple's lowest-end M-series chip as early as mid-2027. 
<br/>
<br/>
If this rumor proves to be accurate, Intel could supply Apple with M6 or M7 chips for future MacBook Air, iPad Air, and iPad Pro models at a minimum. However, while previous Intel chips for Macs were designed by Intel and based on x86 architecture, M-series chips are designed by Apple and use Arm architecture. Intel would only assist with manufacturing.

<p>I’m guessing part of the reason is that <a href="https://x.com/SethBurn/status/1993549909388316845">the incumbent gate-keepers hate AI</a>.

Cox's report describes some odd experiences with the Podcasts app that certainly suggest something untoward is going on across both iOS and macOS versions.

            <p><em>Summarized by AI.</em></p>
<p><strong>Open source software is sustained by overworked, often unpaid volunteers</strong>, many of whom face crushing workloads and relentless community pressure. A recent study by Miranda Heath, supported by Sentry’s Open Source Pledge, reveals that burnout among maintainers is not an isolated issue but a systemic failure threatening the stability of the global software ecosystem. <strong>Critical infrastructure depends on developers who are exhausted, demotivated, and increasingly ready to quit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Burnout manifests in three escalating stages</strong>: first, the loss of motivation, where tasks once manageable feel impossible to begin; then emotional breakdown, with irritability, frustration, and withdrawal from communities; and finally, cognitive detachment, marked by cynicism and alienation from the work. Surveys show that <strong>73% of developers have faced burnout</strong>, and 60% of maintainers have considered leaving open source entirely—a di</p> [...]<br>

North Carolina's Economic Investment Committee voted this week to grant Apple a four-year extension on the timelines originally established when the company secured a rare "transformative" Job Investment Grant in 2021. The move follows Apple's confirmation last year that it had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/apple-north-carolina-campus-paused/">paused construction plans</a> and was seeking to renegotiate the agreement with the state.

            Apple today shared its annual holiday season ad, titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-avONMmQtlI"><em>A Critter Carol</em></a>, as well as a behind-the-scenes video showing how it was made.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
In the short film, set in a snowy forest, a group of woodland creatures use a lost iPhone 17 Pro to film themselves singing about the gift of friendship. Later, the owner of the iPhone finds the device with help from the Find My app on his Apple Watch, and he then discovers the critters' heartwarming recording.
<br/>
<br/>
In an AI world, Apple's ad emphasizes the use of practical effects. The critters — a raccoon, bear, owl, deer, squirrel, and others — are handcrafted puppets.

The short film was shot entirely on the iPhone 17 Pro, according to Apple, although the fine print says that additional hardware and software was used. The behind-the-scenes video shows how the ad was made by puppeteers, and how the typography used throughout the ca [...]<br>

Once the executives that started it leaves, it stops. Then a new one comes in that does almost the opposite. Put all your apps in the cloud, bring all your apps on-premises.</p>
<p>Tide goes out, tide comes in.</p>
<p>That pattern of course fuels staff “modernization fatigue” where they just ignore all the slides in Q1 and get on with their lives.</p>
