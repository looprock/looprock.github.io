            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's Live Translation feature, unveiled during its AirPods Pro 3 announcement, is expanding to older models including AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation and AirPods Pro 2.

<br/>
The new Live Translation functionality requires AirPods updated with the latest firmware to pair with an Apple Intelligence-enabled iPhone running iOS 26 or later, so iPhone 15 Pro and newer models are supported. Apple has been beta testing firmware in concert with iOS 26 beta updates, and we expect the firmware to drop the same day that iOS 26 is officially released on September 15.

<br/>
Live Translation enables hands-free communication by allowing users to speak naturally while wearing AirPods. For conversations with non-AirPods users, the iPhone can display live transcriptions horizontally, showing translations in the other pe [...]<br>

            Apple has announced that its new hypertension detection feature, initially exclusive to the Apple Watch Ultra 3 and Apple Watch Series 11, will be expanded to include earlier Apple Watch models.
<br/>

The feature will be available on Apple Watch Series 9 and later, plus Apple Watch Ultra 2 and later models, with watchOS 26. FDA clearance is expected soon, with availability in over 150 countries this month.

Hypertension detection uses the optical heart sensor to analyze blood vessel responses over 30-day periods, alerting users to consistent signs of chronic high blood pressure. Hypertension affects approximately 1.3 billion adults globally and often goes undiagnosed due to lack of symptoms.

<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> 3, Apple Watch Series 11, and Apple Watch Ultra 3 all contain the S10 chip. Until now, every new Apple Watch generation featured a new S-series chip since the device's introduction.
<br/>
<br/>
Often, these chips were simply rebadged with few to no changes, with the same CPU used across chips. For example, the S6, S7, and S8 chips all shared the same CPU. Similarly, the S9 and S10 are essentially the same chip. The S10 was merely reduced in size to accommodate the smaller casing of the Apple Watch Series 10.
<br/>
<br/>
As a result, Apple sticking with the S10 chip for the Series 11 and Ultra 3 is not materially different to if it contained an "S [...]<br>
