They launched a course on Shor's algorithm for Bitcoiners and explored potential quantum applications for Bitcoin. Quantum computing's capabilities and Bitcoin's benefits intersect in diverse fields from energy to lost Bitcoin recovery. Exciting possibilities lie at the convergence of Bitcoin and quantum computing.<br>
