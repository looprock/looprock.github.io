            <b>Published:</b> 2026-01-07 08:01:19-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>

<br/>
For years, Spotify's desktop app has allowed users to check on their friends' listening habits via a Friend Activity sidebar, but the ability has not been available on iOS and Android apps until now. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you're familiar with Listening Activity, its appearance on mobile shouldn't throw up any real surprises. You can view what people are listening to in the app's sidebar, next to any messages, and you can tap the track to listen to it yourself, add it to your library, or react to it with emoji.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Dell announced the UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor at CES 2026, billing it as the "world's first 52-inch 6K display." 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031579" height="2160" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/dell-52-ultrawide-6k-thunderbolt@2x.jpg" width="3840"/>
<br/>
At 52 inches, the ultra-wide curved monitor features a 21:9 aspect ratio with 6,144 x 2,560 resolution at 129 pixels per inch and supports refresh rates up to 120Hz.
<br/>
<br/>
The display uses IPS Black panel technology for deeper blacks and improved contrast compared to standard IPS panels, with brightness listed as 400 cd/m. Dell says it emits up to 60% less blue light than competing monitors while maintaining professional-grade color accuracy, and it includes an ambient light sensor for eye comfort during extended use.
<br/>
<br/>
The display's connectivity support is pretty eye-watering, since it basically doubles as a Thunderbolt dock around the back. It includes one Thun [...]<br>

Logitech devices like its MX Master series mice and MX Keys keyboards stopped working properly as a result of the oversight, with users unable to access their custom scrolling setup, button mappings, and gestures. It wasn't long before the Logitech subreddit was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/logitech/comments/1c6oynm/logi_options_stuck_loading_forever/">awash with frustrated reports</a> as people discovered their configured peripherals had suddenly reverted to default settings.

LG announced multiple new TVs and displays at its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2026/">CES 2026</a> event, and showed off some older tech. Last year's 32-inch UltraFine Evo 6K monitor was on display, and of all LG's displays, this one looks like it was made for macOS. Text is crisp, the scale is perfect, Thunderbolt 5 is supported, and the NanoIPS panel provides deeper blacks and better contrast than a standard IPS panel.
