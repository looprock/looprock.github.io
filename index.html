            DRAM shortages are set to impact smartphone manufacturers like Apple in 2026, but the company is going to try to keep <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> prices steady despite having to pay more for components, according to <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/2016213691075862869">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.

Kuo says that Apple negotiates memory prices with suppliers on a quarterly basis, so price increases are expected in the second quarter of 2026. The upcoming price hike will be similar to the first quarter increase that has already seen Apple paying more for memory.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Kubernetes memory limits introduce a subtle but critical interaction with the Go runtime that can determine whether a service runs efficiently or fails under load. This article explores how Go manages memory under normal conditions and what changes when Kubernetes enforces hard memory constraints. Using controlled load testing, it shows why Go is generally excellent at self regulating memory, how OOM events emerge once limits are imposed, and how tools like GOMEMLIMIT can be used to align the runtime with container boundaries. Originally published in July 2024, the guidance remains highly relevant for teams running Go services in containerized environments where stability and throughput are tightly coupled to memory configuration.</p><br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>You need to write SEO and enterprise research text for AIs now, in addition to humans. Does this mean separate pages, often hidden from humans like we see for search engine SEO? Probably.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Gartner survey of 377 U.S. consumers, conducted in June and July 2025, revealed that rather than shortcutting decisions, AI features are lengthening the research journey. Thirty-one percent of consumers surveyed say AI summaries cause them to spend more time searching for information, compared to just 16% who spend less. Over two-thirds continue past Google’s AI Overview, signaling that summaries are not the final answer. When researching purchases, 31% of consumers consider more product options due to AI overviews, versus only 7% who consider fewer.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>People often ask me where to stay in Amsterdam that’s fun, but not full of tourists and drunk people. Here’s what I tell them.</p>
<p>You should stay in De Pijp or the Jordaan. These are the neighborhoods just outside of the touristy part of city center that still have all the things you’re thinking of when you think Amsterdam, plenty of nice bars and cafes, hipstery and traditional eateries, excellent architecture and narrow streets, canals, bikes, etc. And yes, plenty of coffee shops (places to buy weed).</p>
<p>If you want more sleepy, but sill urban with stores and coffee ships and stuff, there’s Watergraafsmeer or the even calmer Eastern Docklands.</p>
<p>But I’d stay in De Pijp.</p>
<p>Here’s is an imprecise map:</p>
