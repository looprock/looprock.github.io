The main body of the device will apparently use a revised titanium material that improves strength while reducing overall weight when compared with existing titanium ‌iPhone‌ frames, despite having virtually the same surface area.

            Apple is confronting a newly intensified supply-chain challenge for future chips as the AI boom has created a global shortage of a key material, <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/business/technology/tech-asia/apple-and-qualcomm-fret-over-strained-supplies-of-japan-s-glass-cloth">Nikkei Asia</a> reports.

Apple is said to be struggling to secure sufficient supplies of high-end glass cloth fiber, a material that plays a critical role in the printed circuit boards and chip substrates used in iPhones and other devices. The most advanced forms of this glass cloth are apparently produced almost entirely by one supplier, Nitto Boseki.

            Apple is preparing to mass-produce its own AI-focused server chips in the second half of 2026 amid reliance on a short-term partnership with Google to meet immediate AI expectations, according to analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.
