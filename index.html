            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            At least one next-generation Apple Watch model will start using resin-coated copper, according to supply chain sources cited by <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240422PD225/nanya-pcb-apple-supply-chain-ic-substrate.html">Taiwanese website <em>DigiTimes</em></a>.

<br/>
As the name implies, resin-coated copper is a thin layer of copper foil coated with a resin, such as an epoxy. While adoption of this material would offer many benefits for a future Apple Watch's logic board, such as improved durability and water resistance, a key advantage is that it would <a href="https://na.industrial.panasonic.com/products/electronic-materials/lineup/circuit-board-materials/series/133871">allow for a thinner logic board</a>, which in turn would provide additional internal space for other components and sensors in the Apple Watch.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The U.S. Senate voted on Tuesday to pass a bill that will either ban TikTok from app stores operating in the country or force Chinese company ByteDance to sell the short-form video app.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-752609" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/tiktok-logo.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
The landmark bill has now passed both chambers of Congress, having already been approved by the House of Representatives. President Biden says he will sign the bill into law on Wednesday.
<br/>
<br/>
Once that happens, TikTok will be banned in the United States if ByteDance does not divest ownership within nine months, with a possible three-month extension to that deadline if a deal is in progress.  China would need to approve any sale, but the Chinese government has already made it clear that it will "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/23/technology/tiktok-congress-hearing.html">firmly oppose</a>" such a move.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The European Commission has waved through <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_608">new 'right to repair' legislation</a> that aims to make it easier for consumers to get their broken devices fixed, even if products are out of warranty.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-484620" height="719" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/01/European-Commisssion.jpg" width="1080"/>
<br/>
The EU already requires companies to offer a two-year minimum warranty on common household appliances and electronics, such as smartphones, TVs, washing machines, and vacuum cleaners, but the new rules impose additional requirements.
<br/>
<br/>
According to the legislation, if a consumer chooses to have their device repaired under warranty, the warranty must be extended by a year. Consumers may also borrow a device while theirs is being repaired, and if it cannot be fixed, they have the right to opt for a refurbished unit as an alternative.

Nomad says that its <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/sport-band-glow-2">Glow 2.0 Sport Band</a> is three times brighter than the prior-generation version, and it did indeed have a strong and long lasting glow in our testing.
