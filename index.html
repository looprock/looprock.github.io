            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's stock price has crossed the $200 mark and reached a new all-time high in intraday trading, one day after the company unveiled its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-generative-personal-ai-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">Apple Intelligence suite of AI features</a> coming with iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia.

<br/>
Apple's stock price has split five times since the company went public, including on a 4-for-1 basis in 2020 most recently. This means that Apple's stock price would be over $45,000 today if it had never been split, and all other things being equal.
<br/>
<br/>
Generative AI has been a hot topic ever since ChatGPT debuted in 2022, and investors had been waiting for Apple to unveil its own plans for the technology.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the first beta of iOS 18 now in the hands of developers, there are a handful of smaller changes and quality-of-life improvements being discovered in Apple's iPhone software that are worth highlighting.

<br/>
First up, Apple has improved the flashlight controls. In iOS 18, turning on the Flashlight via the Lock Screen or Control Center now brings up a small interface that lets you adjust the flood of light from the LED. In other words, you now have granular control over not only the intensity of light, but also the breadth of illumination.

Enabled by default, the feature will speed up the adoption of passkeys, which are more secure than a traditional login and password. Passkeys log you in with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> rather than a password, and because on-device authentication is required, passkeys put a stop to online attacks like phishing.
