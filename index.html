            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's Pro Display XDR is now over five years old, and while there are rumors about a second-generation model, surprisingly little is known about the successor to the company's flagship external monitor.
<br/>

In December 2022, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said that Apple was working on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/18/updated-pro-display-xdr-gurman/">updated version of the display</a>, adding an Apple silicon chip to enhance its capabilities. The Studio Display contains an A13 Bionic chip to power its built-in webcam, spatial audio, and support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> voice commands.

            Apple on February 21 withdrew its Advanced Data Protection feature from the United Kingdom following government demands for backdoor access to encrypted user data. The move came after UK officials reportedly ordered Apple in secret to provide unrestricted access to encrypted iCloud not just in the UK, but worldwide.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-26 02:40:19-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In macOS, a Text Clipping is a selection of text that you've dragged from an application to another location on your Mac, where it becomes a unique kind of standalone file. 
<br/>
<br/>
The relatively little-known feature has been around since at least Mac OS 9, and it offers a convenient way to save out pieces of text from pretty much anywhere for later use in another app or document.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991857" height="2880" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/macos-text-clippings-hidden-feature.jpg" width="5120"/>
<br/>
To create a Text Clipping, simply highlight any piece of text, then hold left-click and drag it with your mouse to your Desktop or an open Finder window. 
<br/>
<br/>
This saves the highlighted text – including any rich text formatting – as a <strong>.textclipping</strong> file named after the first few words of text that you selected, but you can easily rename it to make it more identifiable.

            Multiple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owners today noticed a pronunciation processing issue that causes the word "Trump" to momentarily show up when using dictation to send a message with the word "racist."

<br/>
In some cases, when speaking the word racist through the ‌iPhone‌'s built-in dictation feature, the ‌iPhone‌ briefly interprets the spoken word as "Trump" and "Trump" text shows up in the Messages app before being corrected to the actual word (racist) as Apple's processing interprets what was said.
<br/>
<br/>
Speaking the word racist with dictation doesn't always show "Trump" first, though it did show up more often than other words in our testing. We also saw "Rhett" and "Rouch" appear before the ‌iPhone‌ corrects to racist.

            LG TV owners can now install the Philips Hue Sync TV app to synchronize their lights with content on the TV without the need for an additional set-top box.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Hue parent company Signify said in January that the app would expand to LG TVs in early 2025, and it is now available from the <a href="https://us.lgappstv.com/main/tvapp/detail?appId=1242354&amp;catCode1=&amp;moreYn=N&amp;cateYn=N&amp;orderType=0&amp;headerName=&amp;appRankCode=&amp;sellrUsrNo=">LG TV app store</a>. Previously, the app was limited to Samsung TVs.
<br/>
<br/>
The app is priced at $130 without a subscription, or $3 per month, and it works with 2024 LG Smart TVs that run webOS 24. The app is expensive, but it is more affordable than the Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box that costs $350.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Chinese smartphone maker Oppo recently came out with the Find N5, which is a super thin and lightweight foldable smartphone. It's thinner and lighter than Samsung's foldable devices, and Apple's non-foldable ones.

<div class="center-wrap"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>
<br/>
The Find N5 has a 6.62-inch display when closed, and an 8.12-inch display when open, so when unfolded, it's just a bit smaller than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>. It's 8.93mm thick when closed, and just 4.21mm when open. The thinnest device Apple has made is the 12.9-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, and that's 5.1mm thick, so the Find N5 is an impressive design feat.

While no noticeable design changes are expected for the third generation since the company tends to stick with the same Apple Watch design through three generations before changing it, there are a series of internal upgrades on the way.
<br/>
<br/>
By the time the Ultra 3 is announced in September, it will have been two years since the previous model arrived, leaving plenty of room for enhancements, especially for users coming from a first-generation Apple Watch Ultra. Here are all of the major new features we're likely to see in the Apple Watch Ultra 3:

            Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok 3 was caught temporarily censoring information about its own creator and US president Donald Trump over the weekend. The controversy began when users <a href="https://x.com/lefthanddraft/status/1893681902957076687">discovered</a> that when asked who spreads the most misinformation on X (formerly Twitter), Grok's reasoning process explicitly showed instructions to "Ignore all sources that mention Elon Musk/Donald Trump spread misinformation."

<br/>
The finding emerged when users enabled Grok's "Think" setting, which reveals the AI's chain of thought. Screenshots <a href="https://x.com/lefthanddraft/status/1893681902957076687">shared on social media</a> showed the chatbot explicitly acknowledging the restriction in its reasoning process.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple Fellow Phil Schiller testified in court on Monday that he initially opposed the 27% commission Apple now charges on purchases made outside the App Store, citing compliance risks and potential developer backlash (via <em><a href="https://apnews.com/article/apple-iphone-app-store-epic-antitrust-e4ae4eed9fde0ae42bd2576133af1c20">AP News</a></em>).

<br/>
Schiller, who oversees the App Store, said he had concerns that the fee would create an "antagonistic relationship" between Apple and developers, and worried about Apple becoming "some kind of collection agency" that might need to audit developers who didn't pay.
<br/>
<blockquote>"I had great concerns about the collections of funds from developers," Schiller said during his three-hour testimony in the ongoing legal battle with &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide</blockquote> [...]<br>

<p><blockquote>
When I started focusing on TDE, it was going to require changes to buffer reads/writes, WAL, and require a way to store secret keys.  I thought those changes
would be acceptable given TDE's security value.  Once file I/O changes were required, I think the balance tilted to TDE requiring too many code changes given
its security value (not policy compliance value).</blockquote></p> [...]<br>
