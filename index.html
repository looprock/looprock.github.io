            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            An image allegedly showing the box for a new unreleased MacBook Pro has emerged on Chinese social media platform Weibo.
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918435" height="1243" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/alleged-m3-macbook-pro-box.jpeg" width="2048"/>

The picture, re-shared on X by <a href="https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1717105054287826967/photo/1">ShrimpApplePro</a>, shows what looks like Apple packaging featuring a MacBook Pro image with previously unseen wallpaper on the display. The wallpaper bears a passing resemblance to the one Apple used for the iPhone 15 Pro.

It's unclear whether the image is legitimate or simply faked.

Passkeys are a more secure alternative to passwords because a passkey cannot be shared with another person through a phishing attempt or leaked online through a database hack. Passkeys do not require customers to remember a password or add a two-factor authentication code, but they do require a verified device.
<br/>
<br/>
Passkeys can be set up in the Amazon settings, and on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac, logging in to an Amazon account can be done with a &lt;a h [...]<br>

            “The fog of war” is a phrase that has been used for over a hundred years to describe the profound uncertainty that envelops armed conflicts while they are happening. Today, the uncertainty for non-combatants is exacerbated by the rapid-fire nature of social media, where people often like or re-post dubious war-related material without scrutinizing it [&#8230;]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Listen to our Next Level album as a podcast! We grew up in the days of the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Genesis. It’s no surprise that so many of our tracks are inspired by the 8-bit and 16-bit music of our youth. From Castlevania to Contra, Sonic the Hedgehog, and many more — we were inspired by all the nostalgic soundtracks from the games that got us here, to give our pods one-of-a-kind vibes. If you’ve been head nodding to our beats during our shows and you’ve been wishing for a way to listen outside of our pods, then this release will be an absolute delight. It’s dangerous to go alone! Take this on your next coding adventure or deep work session…<br>
