In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/30/facebook-unifies-messenger-and-instagram/">September 2020</a>, Meta (then Facebook) announced it was merging its Facebook Messenger service with Instagram direct messaging, allowing Instagram users to chat with Facebook users and vice versa using the same platform.
<br/>
<br/>
The move was supposed to be part of a long-term plan to merge Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp chat platforms into one underlying messaging infrastructure. The idea behind the plan was said to be to keep people within the Facebook ecosystem, and off of rival texting apps like Apple's iMessage.

The combined Netflix and Max plan will be available for $10, but there is a minor catch because the subscriptions are ad-supported.
