            Aqara today announced the launch of the <a href="https://www.aqara.com/en/product/smart-lock-u300/">Aqara Smart Lock U300</a>, which is a smart lock that's designed for doors that have a lever or knob but no deadbolt.

<br/>
Many homes have non-deadbolt doors for side entries, garage doors, home offices, basements, and storage rooms, and these kind of door setups do not work with traditional smart locks that require a deadbolt. The U300 lever lock is one of the first smart locks created for these types of doors.
<br/>
<br/>
The U300 replaces a traditional lever or knob, offering smart functionality and the ability to keep an eye on who is coming or going.

The U300 is built with the latest Thread protocol and it is Matter-enabled, so it can be added to an Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit&lt;/</a> [...]<br>

The Oura Ring 4 introduces "Smart Sensing" technology, which the company claims enhances data accuracy by adapting to the specific contours of an individual's finger. This new algorithm reportedly improves blood oxygen sensing accuracy by 30% over the Oura Ring 3, and reduces gaps in heart rate tracking. The ring's sensors are also now recessed, which is said to provide a more comfortable fit for all-day wear.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-10-02 16:04:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Now that Apple doesn't include power adapters with new iPhones, you have to supply your own, and it can be a little confusing figuring out what you need specifically to get the fastest charging speeds. Apple added another layer of complexity this year with upgraded <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> charging for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models, a feature that also requires specific hardware.
<br/>

<br/>
<h2 id="usb-c">USB-C</h2>
<br/>
All of the ‌iPhone 16‌ models can charge from 0 to 50 percent in approximately 30 minutes. You need Apple's $19 20W adapter or better for fast charging, and if you already had an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> that could fast charge, you probably have the hardware you need.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            For the first time in the standard AirPods range, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a> offer optional active noise cancellation (ANC) for an additional $50, providing a quieter and more immersive listening experience, especially in noisy environments.
<br/>

<br/>
Key upgrades of the ‌AirPods 4‌ include a more comfortable fit, improved sound quality with a new low-distortion driver, and enhanced features like Personalized Spatial Audio. Beyond active noise cancellation, there are a handful of additional features that differentiate the two ‌AirPods 4‌ models. This buyer's guide breaks down all of the differences between the two variants and helps you to decide which best fits your needs.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-10-02 08:33:47-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Best Buy might offer an unspecified iPad mini model on clearance "soon," according to a <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-computer-inc-9555093/9555093.p?skuId=9555093">product listing</a> that was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1fuh98z/ipad_mini_clearance_coming_soon/">spotted</a> on the retailer's website.

<br/>
The placeholder listing is for an Apple product with a "MINI WIFI" model name, and it is in the "tablets" section on Best Buy's online store. Altogether, this strongly suggests that the listing will be for an iPad mini. The device will apparently be available for a clearance price of $359.99 in the U.S., down from a regular price of $599. However, the iPad mini currently starts at $499, so the listing appears to have a pricing error.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Well-known electronics repair website iFixit today shared an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sF0BOpbyjY">AirPods 4 teardown video</a> that offers a look inside Apple's latest wireless earbuds. Specifically, these are the entry-level <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4-vs-previous-generations/">AirPods 4</a> without active noise cancellation (ANC).
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Unsurprisingly, iFixit said AirPods remain a "nightmare to take apart," with the earbuds earning a lowest-possible 0/10 score on iFixit's reparability scale.
<br/>
<br/>
The teardown does not reveal any major internal differences between the AirPods 3 and AirPods 4.
<br/>
<br/>
The charging case for the AirPods 4 without ANC is equipped with a 345 mAh battery. This is the same size battery as in the AirPods 3 charging case.
