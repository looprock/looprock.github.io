<br/>
Manfred said he plans to choose a winning bidder for "Sunday Night Baseball" within the month, and the rights could be split up between two bidders.
<br/>
<br/>
ESPN held the rights to "Sunday Night Baseball" through the 2028 season, but the network and MLB mutually opted out of the $550-million contract earlier this year, so ESPN's rights now expire after the 2025 season. Apple is now looking to pick up those final three seasons, along with NBC, and  [...]<br>

Emoji characters that are coming include trombone, treasure chest, distorted face, hairy creature (aka Bigfoot or Sasquatch), fight cloud, apple core, orca, and ballet dancers.

After Unicode 17 is released later this year, artists at Apple will begin creating new emoji characters in the Apple emoji style. It takes several months for Apple to introduce new emoji after a Unicode update, so we can expect to see these characters next spring.

            It looks like Apple's foldable iPhone will have some "crease-free" competition.

<br/>
Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1945871948468404342">said</a> Samsung's next-generation Galaxy Z Fold 8 will use the same laser-drilled metal display plate as the foldable iPhone, with the component to be supplied by South Korean company Fine M-Tec.
<br/>
<br/>
Samsung's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/samsung-galaxy-z-fold7/">new Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> still has a visible crease in the middle of its inner screen. However, Kuo said that Apple's stricter crease-free requirement for the foldable iPhone has essentially raised the bar for foldable devices, so it sounds like next year's Galaxy Z Fold 8 will feature a "crease-free" screen as well.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            A new rumor out of China today has sparked speculation that Apple may be readying a unique new iPhone 17 Pro color that somehow reflects the new design language of its iOS 26 software.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1011198" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iPhone-17-Pro-Iridescent-Feature-2.5.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://t.co/nBP4VF7qri">Instant Digital</a> on Thursday hinted that the iPhone 17 Pro has a "special" color variant that is said to be "connected to the iOS 26 Liquid Glass design." 
<br/>
<br/>
The leaker, who only claims to have heard of it but not seen it, seems to believe that the color is what previous leaks have simply referred to as white, "but it appears differently depending on the lighting." 
<br/>
<br/>
While speculative, a white base material that subtly shifts hues depending on light and angle could add a dynamic, refractive quality to the color. Combined with the Liquid Glass UI [...]<br>

The 2020 triple-A game has been Metal API-optimized for a variety of Macs with Apple silicon, from the first M1 models right up to the latest M4 models. The only caveat is that <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> requires a minimum of 16GB of RAM to play, so 8GB M1 and M2 chips don't get a look in.

            You may have missed it, but select Apple Watch models are gaining a new Wrist Flick gesture in watchOS 26 that allows users to dismiss notifications and return to their watch face with a simple wrist movement.

The gesture works by turning your wrist over and back, using the accelerometer and gyroscope to detect the motion. With the gesture, you can dismiss incoming notifications, mute calls, silence alarms and alerts, and return to the watch face without needing to use your other hand.

The new capability adds a simple "Record" button to the input window in the desktop app that allows you to capture both microphone and system audio during meetings or calls.

According to a <a href="https://cirpapple.substack.com/p/airpods-succeed-yet-need-to-succeed">new report</a> from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP), approximately 44% of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owners in the United States now report owning Bluetooth earbuds, up from 41% in the previous year.
