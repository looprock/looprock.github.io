            It has been nearly four years since Apple released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>, so an update to the over-ear headphones is highly anticipated.

<br/>
Below, we recap the latest rumors about the AirPods Max.
<br/>
<br/>
As a refresher, Apple released the AirPods Max in December 2020, after announcing them in a press release shared on the Apple Newsroom website. The headphones have not received any hardware upgrades since, leading some customers to hold off on their purchase and hope that Apple will eventually release AirPods Max 2.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, rumors suggest that AirPods Max 2 are not coming any time soon, with only minor revisions expected for the headphones later this year.
