Although <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> was only mentioned briefly, today we have a better grasp on all the new features coming to the Music app thanks to the developer beta of ‌iOS 17‌.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Crossfade</h2>
<br/>
The first major update is the ability to crossfade between songs, which Apple says will let you smoothly transition between songs so your music never stops. ‌Apple Music‌ iOS users have been waiting for this feature for a while now, making it one of the headlining additions to the Music app in ‌iOS 17‌.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 17 includes several improvements to the Health app, including new <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/health/">mental health and vision health features</a>. Another useful addition to the app is follow-up reminders for scheduled medications, in case you forget to mark them as taken.
<br/>

<br/>
When the setting is turned on, the Health app will send you follow-up reminders if you have not logged a medication 30 minutes after the initial notification. There is also an option to have follow-up reminders sent as critical alerts that appear on the Lock Screen and play a sound, even if a Focus mode is turned on or the iPhone is muted.

iOS 17 is available in beta for members of Apple's Developer Program, and will be released to the public later this year for the iPhone XS and newer.&lt;div class="l [...]<br>

<br/>
With just a few taps, you can create links between notes, making it easy to jump from one idea to another. Long press on a space in any note, and a new "Add Link" option can be found in the pop-up menu. Tapping it lets you link to another note by searching its title or entering a URL. 
<br/>
<br/>
You can create an optional alternative title for the link, or just stick with the original title for clarity. Once you're done, the link appears as hyperlink-style underlined text in your note, and tapping it snaps you straight into the note you linked to.

            Apple is making contact and password sharing a lot easier in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> by letting users insert them into any text field they encounter in the system.

<br/>
When long pressing in a text box, a new "Insert" option appears in the pop-up menu. Tapping it brings up another menu with two additional new options: "Contacts" and "Passwords."
<br/>
<br/>
Choosing Contacts takes you straight to your contacts list for you to make your selection, while tapping Password takes you to your passwords keychain after authentication.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-06-05 16:34:22-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today announced the Apple Vision Pro, a wearable augmented and virtual reality headset. Because of the way the headset fits against the face, it does not accommodate glasses, but Apple has a solution for those who need prescription lenses. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898584" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/apple-vision-pro-lenses.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
Apple is partnering with Zeiss to offer Zeiss Optical Inserts that can be customized to each person's vision prescription. The inserts will attach to the Vision Pro lenses magnetically, allowing for precise viewing and eye tracking. 
<br/>
<br/>
There is no word yet on what the Zeiss prescription inserts will cost, but Apple says that vision correction accessories will be sold separately. 
<br/>
<br/>
Glasses wearers will need a valid prescription to get the inserts, and not all prescriptions will be supported, so there will be some limitations that might prevent some peo [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's Vision Pro headset is the company's first new product category since the Apple Watch, and it is unlike any other Apple device. It runs an operating system called visionOS, and developers will need to create augmented and virtual reality apps specifically for the headset.

<br/>
To ensure that there are a wide selection of experiences available at launch, Apple plans to provide <a href="https://developer.apple.com/visionos/work-with-apple/">Apple Vision Pro developer kits</a> to developers at some point in the future.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that developer kits will be offered to help developers bring their creations to life on Vision Pro, and that they will offer the ability to quickly build, iterate, and test on the headset. Developers will be able to apply to get a kit, but Apple hasn't offered details on when the k [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> beta, Apple has introduced a new accessibility feature called Personal Voice. First highlighted <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/17/ios-17-personal-voice-feature/">earlier this year</a>, Personal Voice is designed to allow you to use artificial intelligence to create a replica of your voice.

<br/>
The feature is aimed at those who are at risk of losing their ability to speak, with Personal Voice offering these individuals the chance to "create a voice that sounds like them" for communication purposes.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-06-05 15:15:05-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If your Messages app often becomes cluttered with one-time verification codes that you need to manually delete, it's going to get a lot easier to clean them up in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>.

<br/>
The ‌iOS 17‌ update includes a new option to delete verification codes in Messages (and Mail) after they've been inserted into an app or website through the Autofill feature.
<br/>
<br/>
"Clean Up Automatically" can be toggled on for verification codes in the Passwords app under Password Options.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is enhancing the security of Safari in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, and private browsing now requires <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> authentication or a passcode to access.
