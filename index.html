Try Galaxy uses two iPhones to "showcase the benefits" of the Galaxy Z Fold5's large display.

When searching for a store using the "Locations" feature in the app, there's now a Good to Know section and a Store Hours section, both of which are new.

In Good to Know, Apple lists information like accessibility options and whether a store location offers product recycling. The Store Hours shows the upcoming hours for each location on a specific date basis. Rather than just listing Monday-Sunday hours, Apple has a list for the upcoming dates, which gives up-to-date information should store hours change for an event or environmental issue.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The transistor burst upon the electronic scene in the 1950s. Almost overnight the size of new models of radios, television sets, and a host of other electronic devices shrank like deflating balloons. Suddenly the hard-of-hearing could carry their sound amplifiers in their ears. Teenagers could listen to favorite music wherever they went. Everywhere we turned the transistor was making its mark. There was even a proposal before Congress to require that every home have a transistor radio in case of emergency.

The next development to fire the imagination of scientists and engineers was the laser—an instrument that produces an enormously intense pencil-thin beam of light. Most of us have heard so much about this invention it seems hard to believe that the first one was built only a few years ago. We were told that the laser was going to have an even greater effect on our lives than the transistor. It was going to replace everything from dentists’ drills to electric wires. The whole world, it seemed, eventually wo [...]<br>

            Word-of-mouth promotion is a powerful strategy in customer acquisition and retention. Referral systems are key in this context, divided into "Open" and "Closed" types. Closed systems involve a controlled process where leads are verified before incentives are given. Open systems allow easier access but risk misuse. Engineering-wise, preventing gaming requires encoding, serialization, and data structures like hash maps. Incentive tokens are generated for each click, reducing chances of manipulation. Frontend involvement includes token storage and inclusion in requests. Additional backend measures like using device identifiers can enhance fraud prevention. This fraud prevention system requires a strong backend and frontend integration.<br>
