            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple will begin using a new material to make its printed circuit boards thinner starting next year, according to a source with a good track record.

<br/>
Apple will reportedly switch to using resin coated copper (RCC) foil as a new printed circuit board (PCB) material in 2024. The change will apparently allow Apple to make its PCBs even thinner. Current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> PCBs are made from a flexible copper substrate material. A thinner PCB could free up valuable space inside compact devices like the ‌iPhone‌ and Apple Watch to provide more room for larger batteries or other components.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When Apple introduced second-generation ‌‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>‌, the Adaptive Transparency feature offered a new way to reduce loud environmental noise for more comfortable everyday listening. Adaptive Audio is designed to build on that approach by dynamically blending the existing Transparency and Active Noise Cancellation modes together to deliver the best audio experience in the moment, tailoring the noise control as the user between different environments and interactions. 
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
In this way, Adaptive Audio aims to automatically reduce loud or distracting noises in your surroundings, such as the sound of a leaf blower or a passing plane overhead, while other noises, like the sudden beep of a car horn, remain audible.
