            At the annual SXSW film festival in Austin, Texas today, Apple's services chief Eddy Cue joined Ben Stiller on stage to discuss the hit Apple TV+ show <a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/originals/severance/">Severance</a>.

Cue is a longtime Apple executive who oversees Apple TV+, and the company's other services, while Stiller serves as the director and an executive producer of Severance.

Severance revolves around the mysterious company Lumon Industries. The company's employees cannot recall any memories about their personal lives while they are at work, and they cannot remember anything about the workplace when they leave the office. The show's second season [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-09 11:45:38-07:00<p>

            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/new-mac-studio-with-m4-max-and-m3-ultra/">new Mac Studio</a> is available with mismatched M4 Max and M3 Ultra chip options. Will there be an M4 Ultra chip in the future, though? It looks unlikely.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993312" height="1102" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/M4-Max-and-M3-Ultra.jpg" width="1960"/>
<br/>
Here are three reasons why Apple might never release an M4 Ultra chip.
<br/>
<br/>
First, among Apple's line of Mac chips, the highest-end Ultra chips are effectively two Max chips fused together with a technology called UltraFusion. So, the M1 Ultra chip is two M1 Max chips combined, and the M2 Ultra chip is two M2 Max chips combined. However, Apple confirmed that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-confirms-m4-max-lacks-ultrafusion/">M4 Max chip lacks an UltraFusion connector</a>, so that means Apple cannot simply release a doubled-up M4 Ultra chip this tim [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has pushed back the launch of its rumored smart home hub due to delayed Siri features, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-09/apple-ipad-air-mac-studio-macbook-air-thoughts-company-explores-smart-glasses"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

<br/>
Gurman no longer expects the home hub to launch this month, but he has not provided a revised timeframe for the device's release.
<br/>
<br/>
"At one point, the company had hoped to announce this product in March," he said, in his <em>Power On</em> newsletter today. "But because the device, to an extent, relies on the delayed Siri capabilities, it has been postponed as well."
<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, he said Apple has started allowing select employees to test a pre-release version of the device at home.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple announced the infamous 12-inch Retina MacBook a decade ago today, an experimental new Mac that was as controversial as it was revolutionary.

<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-849606" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/2016-12-inch-macbook-feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Apple unveiled the 12-inch MacBook on March 9, 2015, at the "Spring Forward" event in San Francisco, California. The event was primarily focused on the Apple Watch, which was being fully detailed ahead of its launch the following month, so the debut of the brand-new MacBook line took many by surprise. Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> introduced the new MacBook as a "reinvention" of the notebook.
<br/>
<br/>
The device was extremely controversial due to its underpowered performance, single USB-C port for both charging and data transfer, short battery life, unreliable butterfly keyboard, and high price point ($1,299 starting p [...]<br>
