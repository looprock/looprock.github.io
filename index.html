            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WhatsApp has released an update allowing iPhone and Android users to send photos over the messaging platform in high resolution, finally addressing the service's low quality image sharing limitation.

<br/>
Previously, WhatsApp users sending photos would see the images automatically compressed and the resolution reduced to 920 x 1280 to save storage space and keep image-sharing fast over low bandwidth data connections.

After updating, they'll have the option to send images to friends and family in "HD quality," which equates to 3024 x 4032 resolution. The rollout of the feature was announced by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg via a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/4/videos/2577125352453919/">Facebook post</a>.

            The rise of the digital revolution and data management has made Elastic Search a crucial element in application design. Elastic Search, built upon Lucene, offers advanced data indexing, full-text search, and scalability. It's favored for its rapid indexing of large datasets and quick queries. The article explores its role in high-load scenarios, highlighting key performance metrics like query latency, indexing rate, garbage collection, CPU usage, disk I/O, and cluster health. Challenges like slow queries, node failure, memory issues, and improper configuration are discussed. To optimize, strategies include index tuning, query refinement, hardware upgrades, cache management, bulk indexing, and adjusting refresh intervals.

<p>I’ve been off the publishing grid for awhile, even off the consuming the Internet grid. This is a mix of partial vacation, taking care of some family things, an obsession with D&amp;D, and the first break in my workaholic nature for…20…even 30 years?</p>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-08-18 06:14:40+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            AI systems today exhibit biases along race, gender, and other factors that reflect societal prejudices and imbalanced training data.
Main causes are lack of diversity in data and teams, and focus on pure accuracy over fairness.
Mitigation tactics like adversarial debiasing, augmented data, and ethics reviews can help reduce bias.
Fundamentally unbiased AI requires rethinking how we build datasets, set objectives, and make ethical design central.
Future challenges include pursuing general AI safely while removing bias, and cross-disciplinary collaboration.
AI has potential as a rational foil to counteract irrational human biases and promote fairness, if developed responsibly.
Choices made now in how AI is created and applied will determine whether it reduces or amplifies discrimination in the long run.<br>
