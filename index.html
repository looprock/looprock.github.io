            <b>Published:</b> 2023-11-15 16:46:54-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The third watchOS 10.2 beta that Apple released this week reintroduces an Apple Watch feature for swapping watch faces that was initially removed with the upgrade to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>.
<br/>

<br/>
Users can now choose to use a swipe gesture to switch the active Apple Watch face by enabling the option in the Apple Watch Settings app. With the feature turned on, swiping left or right on the watch face scrolls through the available watch faces that have been set up.
<br/>
<br/>
Switching watch faces with a swipe gesture was the default in watchOS 9, but Apple updated the interaction because of complaints that it was too easy to accidentally change watch faces. The current gesture requires long pressing before swiping to change the active watch face.

Instagram has added more than 20 new filters that can be used to tweak the look of images, and this is the first time in several years that filters have been updated. Some of the filters add subtle color changes, while others change the look entirely by adding blur and other effects. All of the filters have an intensity slider to tweak the final look.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WhatsApp is rolling out a new voice chats feature in groups that lets users start voice calls without disturbing everyone in the group.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922605" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/whatsapp-voice-chats.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
Previously in WhatsApp group chats, the only option was to start a voice call, which rings every member in the group. If no-one joins, the call doesn't go ahead. 
<br/>
<br/>
In contrast, voice chats can be initiated in a group without anyone joining, and users are prompted to join discreetly via a silent push notification. The feature is available for those WhatsApp groups with 33 to 128 members.
<br/>
<br/>
Group members not participating in the voice chat can see who is active in the call from the chat header and the Calls tab, and people can join or leave at any time. If the encrypted chat remains empty for 60 minutes, it automatically ends.
