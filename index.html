            Apple is lobbying India to amend a decades-old tax law that could expose the company to billions of dollars in taxes on equipment it owns inside local <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> factories, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/apple-lobbies-india-change-tax-law-seen-hindering-its-expansion-sources-say-2025-10-15/"><em>Reuters</em> reports</a>.

<br/>
Apple is reportedly urging the Indian government to modify provisions in the Income Tax Act of 1961 to ensure it is not taxed simply for owning high-value manufacturing machinery supplied to its contract manufacturers, including Foxconn and Tata Electronics. The issue is a potential obstacle to Apple's expansion in the country.

Indian law currently treats such ownership as creating a "business connection", ef [...]<br>

<br/>
The Korean-language report claims that only the ‌iPhone 18‌ Pro and ‌iPhone 18‌ Pro Max will feature the camera, which will replace the main wide-angle camera on the rear, sitting alongside the ultra-wide and telephoto cameras.

This means that in dark environments, the aperture can be opened to receive more light, while in light environments, it can be closed to prevent over-exposure. It also should provide users with greater control over depth of field, which [...]<br>

<br/>
The ‌MacBook Pro‌ will be one of the first new devices to use the next-generation M5 chip, which will replace the M4 chip.

            With every flagship smartphone launch, the new devices are subject to bend tests, drop tests, and other durability tests. YouTuber JerryRigEverything (Zack Nelson) is known for his scratch and bend tests, and he did his usual routine with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. This time, something went wrong.

When Nelson bent the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, it broke on the first test, and the second test damaged the battery and engulfed his studio in smoke. Nelson bent the smartphone backward in a way unlikely to occur in normal use, but it's also the first time that he's had a battery rupture.

"Surprisingly, in the decade that I've been durability testing phones, I have never had a smartphone explode before," he says. "The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the first phone to go up in smoke."

<h2>The challenge: Etsy’s unique inventory</h2>
<p>With millions of creative items across thousands of categories – many of which are unique – it’s difficult to accurately capture all possible product attributes, which range from standard attributes like “color” and “material”, to niche attributes like “bead hole size” and “slime additives.” The range of possible attributes and their values is so broad that it’s a challenge even to enumerate them, let alone label listings with specific attribute data.
