            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            A new rumor out of China today has sparked speculation that Apple may be readying a unique new iPhone 17 Pro color that somehow reflects the new design language of its iOS 26 software.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1011128" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iPhone-17-Pro-Iridescent-Feature-2.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://t.co/nBP4VF7qri">Instant Digital</a> on Thursday hinted that the iPhone 17 Pro has a "special" color variant that is said to be "connected to the iOS 26 Liquid Glass design."

<br/>
The leaker, who only claims to have heard of it but not seen it, seems to believe that the color is what previous leaks have simply referred to as white, "but it appears differently depending on the lighting." 
<br/>
<br/>
While speculative, a white base material that subtly shifts hues depending on light and angle could add a dynamic, refractive quality to the color. Combined with the Liquid Glass UI [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Development studio CD Projekt Red today released acclaimed role-playing action game <em><a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/us/en/">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a></em> for the Mac, and it looks like the developers have gone all-out to make the experience as impressive as possible for Mac gamers with the right hardware.

<br/>
The 2020 triple-A game has been Metal API-optimized for a variety of Macs with Apple silicon, from the first M1 models right up to the latest M4 models. The only caveat is that <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> requires a minimum of 16GB of RAM to play, so 8GB M1 and M2 chips don't get a look in.

<br/>
Wrist Flick joins the existing Double Tap gesture as another one-handed control option for Apple Watch users. The feature can be toggled on or off in Settings ➝ Gestures ➝ Wrist Flick.

The new capability adds a simple "Record" button to the input window in the desktop app that allows you to capture both microphone and system audio during meetings or calls.

When recording stops, ChatGPT processes the audio on OpenAI's servers, generating structured notes complete with summaries, action items, and timestamped references. Microphone and system audio permissions must be enabled by the user first.
