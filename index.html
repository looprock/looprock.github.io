            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-16 08:45:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple will finally deliver the Apple Watch Ultra 3 sometime this year, according to analyst Jeff Pu of GF Securities Hong Kong (via <a href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1934164078702076095">@jukanlosreve</a>).

<br/>
The analyst expects both the Apple Watch Series 11 and Apple Watch Ultra 3 to arrive this year (likely alongside the new iPhone 17 lineup, if previous launches are anything to go by), according to his latest product roadmap shared with investors.
<br/>
<br/>
It's been a long wait for Ultra fans. Apple skipped updating the rugged smartwatch entirely in 2024, choosing instead to simply add a black titanium color option to the existing Apple Watch Ultra 2. That means it will have been nearly two years when September rolls around since we've seen any meaningful changes to the Ultra lineup.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has lost a legal challenge in the Netherlands after a Dutch court ruled that the company abused its dominant market position by imposing restrictive payment terms on dating app developers (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/dutch-court-confirms-apple-abused-dominant-position-dating-apps-2025-06-16/">Reuters</a></em>).

<br/>
<br/>
The ruling was issued earlier today by the Rotterdam District Court, confirming a 2021 decision by the Dutch Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM), which found that Apple violated European Union competition laws by forcing dating app developers to use its proprietary in-app payment system, prohibiting them from directing users to alternative payment methods, and charging commissions of up to 30% on transactions.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            watchOS 26 brings a significant upgrade to the Apple Watch's architecture, transitioning the latest models to full arm64.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1005491" height="1049" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/watchos-26.jpg" width="1865"/>
<br/>
The change was revealed in Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/334/?time=161">"What's new in watchOS 26" video</a> for developers. The Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> are set to move from arm64_32 to the full arm64 architecture.
<br/>
<br/>
The arm64_32 architecture was a modified version of the standard 64-bit ARM architecture with 32-bit pointers, specifically optimized for the constrained memory environments of wearable devices. This hybrid architecture allowed Apple to implement the benefits of 64-bit instruction sets while maintaining a tighter memory footprint than full 64-bit systems. [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple may launch the AirPods Pro 3 in 2026, according to analyst Jeff Pu of GF Securities Hong Kong, contradicting earlier predictions of a much sooner release.

<br/>
Pu's Apple product timeline (via <a href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1934164078702076095">@jukanlosreve</a>) comes as a bit of a surprise. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said in February that new AirPods with heart rate monitoring were "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/airpods-with-heart-rate-monitoring-months-away/">months away,</a>" suggesting a late 2025 launch at the earliest. Code references to AirPods Pro 3 were also recently <a href="https://x.com/stevemoser">unearthed</a> in the iOS 26 beta by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Steve Moser.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-16 04:12:11-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's Terminal app is getting a visual refresh in macOS Tahoe, and it's the first notable design update since the command-line tool debuted.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006281" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/terminal-macos-tahoe.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
The updated Terminal will support 24-bit color and Powerline fonts, according to Apple's State of the Platforms presentation at WWDC25. The app will also adopt the new Liquid Glass aesthetic with redesigned themes that align with macOS 26's broader visual overhaul.
<br/>
<br/>
Terminal already offers various color profiles, but the macOS 26 version promises enhanced customization options for displaying system information in more visually appealing ways.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a long-overdue modernization of an app that's essential for developers and power users, as it's remained largely unchanged for over two decades.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The popular, previously PC-centric graphics benchmarking suite <a href="https://www.3dmark.com">3DMark</a> has been launched natively on macOS, offering Mac users a dedicated tool to test their system's gaming performance.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006275" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/3dmark-logo.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
The new macOS version includes four benchmark tests: Wild Life Extreme, Solar Bay, Steel Nomad Light, and the demanding Steel Nomad benchmark previously exclusive to Windows. All tests run natively using Apple's Metal API and produce results comparable across Windows, iOS, and Android platforms.
<br/>
<br/>
UL Solutions developed the macOS port after discovering that one-sixth of 3DMark Steel Nomad Light submissions came from Mac devices running the iOS version. The problem was that the iOS app's frame rate limitations, particularly on powerful Macs, could negatively impact benchmark scores.

<br/>
In 2020, Apple introduced the ability for developers to offer customers unique, alphanumeric codes that they can redeem in the App Store <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/02/apple-developer-subscription-codes/">for free or discounted auto-renewable subscriptions</a>. Later this year, Apple will be allowing developers to offer these codes for any in-app purchases, including consumable items like in-game currency.

Apple previously said that developers can offer customers these one-time codes digitally, such as through an email, or offline at physical events. For  [...]<br>

            iOS 26 can dynamically reserve space for automatic updates, according to Apple.

<br/>
"Depending on the amount of free space available, iOS might dynamically reserve update space for Automatic Updates to download and install successfully," says Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26-release-notes">release notes</a> for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/apple-ios-26-developer-beta/">first iOS 26 developer beta</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
This change will ensure that iPhone users who have Automatic Updates turned on in the Settings app actually have enough storage space available for those updates to download and install. However, Apple has not shared any further information about this capability at this time, so it is unclear exactly how it works.<div class="linkback"></div> [...]<br>

            Apple this week <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tvos/whats-new/">introduced</a> a new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/automaticsigninapi">Automatic Sign-In API</a>, which will make it easier to sign in to apps across multiple Apple devices.

<br/>
Starting with Apple's latest software releases, such as iOS 26 and tvOS 26, you will be able to sign in to a supported app on one Apple device and automatically be signed in to the app on other Apple devices. For example, if you sign in to the Disney+ app on your iPhone, you would automatically be signed in to the Disney+ app on your Apple TV. However, it will take time for developers to begin implementing this functionality.
