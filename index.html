            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Microsoft does not plan to bring an Xbox Cloud Gaming app to iOS at this time because there's no opportunity for monetization, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said in an interview with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24073666/microsoft-gaming-phil-spencer-interview-ps5-switch-games">The Verge</a></em>. When asked whether Apple's recent app ecosystem changes in the European Union make "room" for Xbox Cloud Gaming on iOS, Spencer said that monetization was an issue, and that the Digital Markets Act forcing Apple's updates does not "go far enough to open up competition."

            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> is still months away from being unveiled, but there are already rumors and expectations for the software update, as outlined below.

<br/>
iOS 18 is rumored to include new ChatGPT-like generative AI features for Siri and several built-in Apple apps. The update is expected to add RCS support to the Messages app for an improved texting experience with Android users. A sketchy rumor claimed that iOS 18 will also have some visionOS-inspired design changes.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 will be announced at Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in June, and the update will be released to all users in September.
