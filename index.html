            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Proton today launched <a href="https://proton.me/blog/authenticator-app">Proton Authenticator</a>, a free two-factor authentication app available across all major platforms including iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux.

<br/>
The open-source app generates time-based one-time passwords as an additional security layer beyond regular login credentials. Unlike competitors such as Google Authenticator and Microsoft Authenticator, Proton Authenticator also offers end-to-end encrypted backup and cross-device sync without ads or tracking, just like Proton's other products.

The Swiss-based company claims users can import existing 2FA tokens from other apps within seconds, while the app works offline and automatically backs up authentication codes.

            Apple added Thunderbolt 5 connectivity to its latest M4 Pro and M4 Max machines, and companies are starting to launch Thunderbolt 5 docks compatible with Apple's Thunderbolt 5 Macs. Earlier this year, Anker came out with the Anker Prime TB5 Docking Station, a 14-port dock with a unique design and a high-end feature set.

<br/>
Docks are useful because they expand the available number of ports that you can use at one time, and add legacy ports like USB-A that Apple has discontinued. Thunderbolt 5 provides 80Gb/s symmetric data, which is double that of Thunderbolt 4, plus there is a bandwidth boost option up to 120Gb/s when displays are connected. You're able to connect more without running into bandwidth limits.
