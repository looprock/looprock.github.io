            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Ever searched for something specific, only to be met with results that are <em>close, but not quite</em>? On Etsy’s Search Relevance team, that frustration is exactly what we are tackling. Our goal is simple yet ambitious: to help buyers find exactly what they’re looking for, and to help sellers reach the people seeking their special products.</p>
<p>Search plays a central role in that mission. Historically, Etsy’s search models have relied heavily on engagement signals – such as clicks, add-to-carts, and purchases – as proxies for relevance. These signals are objective, but they can also be biased: popular listings get more clicks, even when they’re not the best match for a specific query.</p>
<p>To address this, we introduce semantic relevance as a complementary perspective to engagement, capturing how well a listing aligns with a buyer’s intent as expressed in their query. We developed a <strong>Semantic Relevance Evaluation and Enhancement Framework</strong>, powered by large language models (LLMs). It</p> [...]<br>

According to a detailed report published by semiconductor analyst Tim Culpan on his blog <em><a href="https://www.culpium.com/p/exclusiveapple-is-fighting-for-tsmc">Culpium</a></em>, Apple is no longer guaranteed preferential access to leading-edge manufacturing capacity at TSMC, marking a notable change after more than a decade in which Apple's chips were central to the foundry's expansion strategy.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Development of Apple's rumored OLED MacBook Pro took another forward step this month when the next-generation production line responsible for manufacturing its displays commenced operation.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984552" height="1265" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/M6-MacBook-Pro-Feature-1.jpg" width="2250"/>
<br/>
Samsung Display is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/oled-macbook-pro-coming-next-year/">expected</a> to make the panels for Apple's MacBook Pro, and has invested heavily in an 8.6-generation OLED production line located at its Asan campus in South Korea. 
<br/>
<br/>
An 8.6G fab uses much larger glass substrates than the OLED lines used for smartphones, which allows multiple laptop-sized panels to be cut from a single sheet. This improves yields and lowers costs, which is just what Apple needs if OLED is to replace mini-LED in the MacBook Pro.

Through dramatic scale and surreal energy, the campaign transforms LA into Ohtani's playground—a cityscape where sport and culture intersect.

The filing is likely for Apple's next-generation Studio Display or Pro Display XDR, but there is not enough information to determine which one it will be.

However, it does seemingly rule out an OLED display for this new model in particular.
