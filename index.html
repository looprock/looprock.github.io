            Earlier this month, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/12/ipad-11-rumored-specs/">iPad 11 will support Apple Intelligence</a>, but a new leak has added uncertainty to the rumor.

According to a private account on social media platform X, with a good track record of sharing iOS-related information, the iPad 11 will be equipped with a chip that has the identifier T8120. That identifier corresponds with the A16 chip, which does not support the Apple Intelligence suite of artificial intelligence features.

A private account on social media platform X today revealed that iOS 18.3 or iPadOS 18.3 will be preinstalled on all of those upcoming devices when they are released.

Directed by Ridley Scott, the advertisement was designed to highlight the Macintosh as a groundbreaking computer that offers freedom and individuality in a market dominated by corporate conformity. It drew inspiration from George Orwell's dystopian novel <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>, with Apple positioning itself as a liberator from the homogenized control represented by the fictional "Big Brother," a veiled allegory for IBM.
<br/>
<br/>
The ad concludes with the voiceover stating, "On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you'll see why 1984 won't be like '1984.'"

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-01-21 15:14:17-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iOS 18.3, Apple made a small but meaningful change to the way the Calculator app works, reintroducing repeating operations. When you tap the equals sign twice, the app will now repeat the last mathematical operation.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960038" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iOS-18-Calculator-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
So, for example, if you type in 5x5 and tap the equals sign, you'll get 25 as a result. If you hit the equals sign again, it will multiply 25x5, and will continue multiplying by 5 every time you tap the equals symbol.
<br/>
<br/>
Repeating operations were an option in the Calculator app prior to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, but ‌iOS 18‌ removed the functionality. Users who have missed the feature will get it back after updating to iOS 18.3. Being able to repeat operations is useful for calculating compound interest.

            The UK government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/digital-driving-licence-coming-this-year">today announced plans</a> for a digital wallet that will house digital driver's licenses. It is not yet clear if the digital wallet that the UK government has planned will integrate with Apple Wallet, but UK users will be able to access their driver's licenses through a GOV.UK app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> when the initiative launches.

<br/>
The blurry, pixelated image shows a pair of rear iPhone shells with a pill-shaped, raised camera bar along the top. On the left side of the bar, there is a circular cutout that appears to be for a single rear camera. On the right side of the bar, there appears to be an LED camera flash and a tiny microphone hole. The ultra-thin "iPhone 17 Air" is the only iPhone 17 model that is expected to have a single rear camera, so the shell could be for that device.
