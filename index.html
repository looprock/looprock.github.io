            Award-winning iPhone camera app <a href="http://halide.cam/download">Halide</a> was today updated for iPhone 15 Pro models, and features a set of in-app triggers that work with the devices' new Action button.

<br/>
With the Halide 2.13 app open on an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max, the Action button can be pressed to trigger manual focus, auto/manual exposure, RAW capture, 12/48-megapixel capture, cycle through lenses, take a picture, and more.
<br/>
<br/>
To achieve the feat, Halide developers built a custom Shortcut that when selected in iOS Settings ➝ Action Button, automatically triggers a pre-set option in the app's dedicated new Action button menu when the app is active.
