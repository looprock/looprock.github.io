            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            UK regulators on Thursday launched an investigation into Apple and Google's smartphone ecosystems to assess whether they have "strategic market status" (SMS), a designation that if imposed would subject the companies to specific conduct requirements set by the Competition and Markets authority (CMA) to improve competition.

<br/>
The investigation will look at the companies' operating systems, app stores and browsers that operate on mobile devices, and the impact they have on users and on businesses developing content and services such as apps for iOS and Android devices. According to the CMA's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-to-investigate-apple-and-googles-mobile-ecosystems">press release</a>, the issues that will form part of the CMA's investigations include:

The request came during a meeting last month where government officials outlined plans for expanding access to state digital services, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-23/india-presses-apple-google-to-open-up-to-state-backed-app-store">Bloomberg</a></em>.

<br/>
The ‌Mac mini‌ was originally designed as a gateway for users to enter the Apple ecosystem without the expense associated with the company's higher-end offerings of the time, such as the Power Mac G5 and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> G5, and costly peripherals. Apple's then-CEO Steve Jobs described the ‌Mac mini‌ as "the most affordable Mac ever" during its unveiling at Macworld Expo 2005, noting that its $499 starting price was intended to appeal to PC users looking to switch to the Mac platform. Today's base model ‌Mac mini‌ with the M4 chip costs just $599.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iconic "1984" commercial, which introduced the Macintosh computer to the world, aired 41 years ago today during Super Bowl XVIII.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-986454" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/1984-ad.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
Directed by Ridley Scott, the advertisement was designed to highlight the Macintosh as a groundbreaking computer that offers freedom and individuality in a market dominated by corporate conformity. It drew inspiration from George Orwell's dystopian novel <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>, with Apple positioning itself as a liberator from the homogenized control represented by the fictional "Big Brother," a veiled allegory for IBM.
<br/>
<br/>
The ad concludes with the voiceover stating, "On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you'll see why 1984 won't be like '1984.'"

<br/>
Apple introduced Live Caller ID Lookup in iOS 18, allowing third-party caller ID apps to securely retrieve information about a caller from their servers, hence today's Truecaller update.
<br/>
<br/>
iPhone users can enable the Live Caller ID Lookup feature by going to Settings ➝ Apps ➝ Phone, and selecting Call Blocking &amp; Identification. Here, users should enable all Truecaller switches and open the Truecaller app again.

            At Yelp, we encountered challenges that prompted us to enhance the training time of our ad-revenue generating models, which use a Wide and Deep Neural Network architecture for predicting ad click-through rates (pCTR). These models handle large tabular datasets with small parameter spaces, requiring innovative data solutions. This blog post delves into our journey of optimizing training time using TensorFlow and Horovod, along with the development of ArrowStreamServer, our in-house library for low-latency data streaming and serving.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-01-21 15:14:17-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iOS 18.3, Apple made a small but meaningful change to the way the Calculator app works, reintroducing repeating operations. When you tap the equals sign twice, the app will now repeat the last mathematical operation.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960038" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iOS-18-Calculator-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
So, for example, if you type in 5x5 and tap the equals sign, you'll get 25 as a result. If you hit the equals sign again, it will multiply 25x5, and will continue multiplying by 5 every time you tap the equals symbol.
<br/>
<br/>
Repeating operations were an option in the Calculator app prior to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, but ‌iOS 18‌ removed the functionality. Users who have missed the feature will get it back after updating to iOS 18.3. Being able to repeat operations is useful for calculating compound interest.
