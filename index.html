            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple just unveiled the first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> redesign in over a decade. The previous major updates to the device were the transition to Apple silicon in 2020 and the option of a Pro-grade chip in 2023, so how does the latest model compare to its two immediate predecessors?

<br/>
The new ‌Mac mini‌ looks dramatically different to previous models thanks to a markedly smaller enclosure and two front USB-C ports, but it is also much more powerful thanks to the M4 and M4 Pro chips. All of the hardware differences between the 2020, 2023, and 2024 ‌Mac mini‌ models are detailed below:

The paywalled report said this iPhone 17 model has already passed an early development stage, as Apple evaluates whether India-based engineers can develop iPhone prototypes that match the quality of those built at its California headquarters.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Say you've captured a stunning sunset at the beach, but there's a trash can ruining the foreground. Or maybe you've taken the perfect family portrait, only to later realize there's a stranger in the background. With iOS 18.1's new Clean Up tool, Apple aims to make such photo frustrations a thing of the past. Here's how it works.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962933" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-Photos-Clean-Up-Feature-1.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Clean Up uses Apple Intelligence to analyze your photos and intelligently remove unwanted elements while preserving the natural look of your images. Granted it's not quite as powerful as desktop editing tools, but it brings impressive object removal capabilities right to your iPhone, letting you fix photo distractions in seconds rather than spending time and money on complex editing software.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <strong>Update:</strong> Hours after this story was published, Apple updated the tech specs for the new iMac to indicate that configurations with the 10-core M4 chip support one external display with up to 8K resolution at 60Hz, not 120Hz. It appears that the original 8K at 120Hz specification in Apple's tech specs was an error. Apple still mentions 8K at 120Hz on its international websites, but those will likely be corrected soon as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Original story follows.

<br/>
<br/>
When configured with a 10-core M4 chip, the new iMac announced today <a href="https://www.apple.com/imac/specs/">supports up to an 8K external display at 120Hz</a>, or up to two 6K displays at 60Hz each.
