            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            While the iPhone 17 Pro models are still nearly a year away from launching, analyst Jeff Pu has already outlined his expectations for the devices.

<br/>
In a research note with investment bank Haitong International this week, Pu reiterated his previous claim that both the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will feature a 48-megapixel Telephoto rear camera and a 24-megapixel front camera. Both the Telephoto and front cameras shoot at 12 megapixels on iPhone 16 Pro models.

He also expects the iPhone 17 Pro models to be equipped with 12GB of RAM, up from 8GB in iPhone 16 Pro models. This increase in memory would contribute to improved performance for Apple Intelligence and multitasking.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In recent months, several credible sources have claimed that Apple plans to release a redesigned, significantly thinner iPhone 17 model next year. The device's name is not yet known, so we are referring to it as the "iPhone 17 Air" for now.

There have been conflicting rumors about the design and specifications for the device, but most sources have agreed that it will have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/">around a 6.6-inch display</a>.

<p id="ZcGGw9">In 2024, you can go onto YouTube, one of the most popular media distributors in the United States and the world, and you can pull up Janet Jackson’s 2004 performance at the Super Bowl. There are videos with her whole 11-minute performance and others that show only the three seconds that shook the country. Justin Timberlake, standing to Jackson’s left and singing “better have you naked / by the end of this song” from his song “Rock Your Body,” reaches across her body, grabs her garment, and yanks. A “wardrobe malfunction” ensues, and instead of revealing a pretty red bra, you — for not even a full second — see her nearly bare breast, a star-sh</p> [...]<br>
