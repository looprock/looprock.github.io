            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            OpenAI says it has uncovered evidence that Chinese AI startup DeepSeek used its proprietary models to train a competing open-source model, potentially violating the company's terms of service.
<br/>

<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-987615" height="3030" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/deepseek-ai-app.jpg" width="5386"/>
<br/>
The discovery centers around a technique called "distillation," where developers use outputs from larger AI models to train smaller ones. The practice is common in AI development, but OpenAI claims DeepSeek crossed a line by using it to build a rival model.
<br/>
<br/>
"The issue is when you take it out of the platform and are doing it to create your own model for your own purposes," a source close to OpenAI told the <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a0dfedd1-5255-4fa9-8ccc-1fe01de87ea6">Financial Times</a></em>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WhatsApp has released version 25.2.3 for iOS devices to patch a significant privacy vulnerability that affected its "View Once" feature. The bug allowed users to access photos and videos that were meant to disappear after a single viewing.
<br/>

<br/>
The security flaw, which only impacted iPhone users, allowed anyone to view supposedly ephemeral content by navigating to Settings ➝ Storage and Data ➝ Manage Storage and sorting media by "Newest." This completely bypassed the privacy protection that View Once was designed to provide.
<br/>
<br/>
Security researcher Ramshath first documented the vulnerability in a <a href="https://medium.com/@ramshath1999/how-i-discovered-a-bypass-in-whatsapps-view-once-feature-aea3bdf6405a">Medium post</a>, prompting WhatsApp to acknowledge the issue and develop a fix.

<br/>
Named SLAP and FLOP, the two security flaws could allow an attacker to use a malicious webpage to spy on the contents of other webpages, giving attackers remote access to browsing history, credit card data, emails, location information, and more. Physical access to a device is not required, and the attack can be executed through a malicious site that bypasses Apple's browser protections.

Several Apple A-series and M-series chips are affected, including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> and later and the A15 and later, which are in the following devices:

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is continuing to promote the Beats Pill speaker, today sharing a new Valentine's Day-themed short ad that uses the cute anthropomorphized "Pill People" characters to highlight battery life.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The spot features the red Beats Pill holding up a be mine sign and playing music in a Say Anything-esque scene. The white Beats Pill walks by and asks how long the red Beats Pill has been outside playing music. "17 hours," replies the speaker, before an end tag comes up that points out the device's 24-hour battery life.
<br/>
<br/>
"Nobody ❤️s a 24-hour battery life like we do. And did you know 2 Beats Pills can be paired together for increased volume? Sounds like a sign to us," reads the ad's description.

<br/>
Apple's Beats brand introduced the new version of the Beats Pill <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/25/beats-pill-bluetooth-speaker-announced/">in June of last year</a>, after the prior Pill+ version was discontinued in early 2022. The  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With today's watchOS 11.3 update, Apple accidentally broke watchOS updates for some older Apple Watch models, according to information circulating on social networks.

            Marvel Snap, a popular game that was caught up in the TikTok ban, returned to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> today and it is once again available for download.

<br/>
The game was published by TikTok parent company ByteDance, which led to its removal from the ‌App Store‌ when a law banning ByteDance apps from being distributed in the U.S. went into effect on January 19.
