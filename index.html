            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Delta recently added support for iOS 26's upgraded boarding pass experience in the Apple Wallet app, according <a href="https://x.com/binner_aar99282/status/1985797942842732602">to <em>MacRumors</em> reader Aaron Binner</a>.

<br/>
This appears to be a server-side change across all iOS 26 versions.
<br/>
<br/>
The upgraded boarding passes have an option to turn on Live Activities, allowing you to keep track of your flight at a glance on your iPhone's Lock Screen, and in the Dynamic Island. You can also share the Live Activities widget with others.
<br/>
<br/>
In addition, new shortcuts provide one-tap access to Apple Maps for airport directions, and to the Find My app for baggage tracking.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the Wallet app automatically updates flight details, such as the gate and departure time.

            With iOS 26.2, Apple is updating the Podcasts app to add a trio of new features <a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/support/5545-enhance-episodes-with-chapters-links-more">and updated tools</a> for podcast creators.

<br/>
All English podcast shows will now get automatically created chapters, which makes it easier to navigate through them. Apple says that automatic chapters will also make it simpler for users to understand an episode's structure and return to specific sections that interest them.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple will use podcast chapters submitted by creators if they're available, but if not, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a> will generate them by default. Podcast creators can turn off the setting in ‌Apple Podcasts‌ Connect.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Fox News has a problem: when you build your entire editorial model around feeding your audience&#8217;s biases, you stop asking whether the stories feeding those biases are actually true. Case in point: last week, they published—and then quietly rewrote—a story about SNAP recipients threatening to &#8220;ransack stores,&#8221; based entirely on AI-generated videos that never happened.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            watchOS 26.2 and iOS 26.2 tweak the Sleep Score feature that's available for the Apple Watch, changing the labeling for point ranges to better match how people might be feeling after a restless night of sleep.

<br/>
The new scores are as follows:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li><strong>Very Low</strong> - 0-40 (previously 0-29)</li>
<br/>
<li><strong>Low</strong> - 41-60 (previously 30-49)</li>
<br/>
<li><strong>OK</strong> - 61-80 (previously 50-69)</li>
<br/>
<li><strong>High</strong> - 81-95 (previously 70-89)</li>
<br/>
<li><strong>Very High</strong> - 96-100 (previously 90-100)</li>
<br/>
</ul>
<br/>
The "Very High" rank used to be "Excellent," but Apple changed the name to be more in line with the other labels.

At the current time, five or six hours of restless sleep can still earn a "High" score [...]<br>

<br/>
<br/>
We don't yet know what's included in the new beta software, but given that these updates will be tested over the holiday period, Apple may be planning to focus on bug fixes and performance improvements rather than adding notable new features.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today provided developers with the first betas of upcoming watchOS 26.2, tvOS 26.2, and visionOS 26.2 betas for testing purposes. The software comes a day after Apple launched the 26.1 versions of each platform.

<br/>
The software updates are available through the Settings app on each device, and because these are developer betas, a free developer account is required.
<br/>
<br/>
We don't know what new features might be added in watchOS 26.2, visionOS 26.2, and tvOS 26.2. Apple doesn't typically provide release notes for betas, so we might not know what's new until the software updates see a public launch unless there are outward-facing changes.

The M5 Vision Pro isn't classified as a second-generation model, which reveals how incremental Apple sees the update over the original <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> version.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In macOS Tahoe 26, Apple gave Spotlight a major update with a visual overhaul, clipboard access, and Actions for performing tasks within apps directly from the search bar.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005000" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/tahoe-spotlight.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
There's quite a lot of hidden potential in Spotlight's new manifestation. Below, we've put together a cheat sheet of Spotlight functionality to help you make the most of it.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Getting Started With Spotlight</h2>
<br/>
You can open Spotlight on your Mac at any time by pressing Command + Space Bar or by clicking the magnifying glass icon in the menu bar. 
<br/>
<br/>
The main Spotlight overlay remains the quickest way to find almost anything on your Mac. Type a keyword to surface apps, documents, emails, contacts, dictionary definitions, or web results. You can drag a file from search results to the desktop or a Finder window, or you can op [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-11-04 07:39:15-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple quietly added a small but notable enhancement to Spotlight in macOS Tahoe 26.1, which was released on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/03/apple-releases-macos-tahoe-26-1/">Monday</a>. The update introduces new clipboard history controls for Spotlight, allowing users to decide how long copied items remain accessible in search results.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025586" height="2160" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/spotlight-clipboard-history-settings-26-1@2x.jpg" width="3840"/>
<br/>
Previously, Spotlight could optionally retain clipboard contents for up to eight hours, but the latest update expands that flexibility with three options – 30 minutes, 8 hours, or 7 days. There's also a new "Clear Clipboard History" button in System Settings ➝ Spotlight, giving users the ability to manually wipe stored clipboard data without having to wipe Spotlight search history wholesale.

The changes should be welcomed by anyone wantin [...]<br>

Often, cybersecurity and DevOps teams work separately, and that could lead to problems. To fix this, organizations must shift from viewing security as a checkpoint to embedding it in DevOps at every step. This article explores how to infuse security in DevOps from [&#8230;]<br>

<p>Figure 1 shows a steady decline in interstate migration rates between 1996 and 2024 across all age groups. The figure also shows that moving rates are consistently higher for younger adults (25-34) than for older age groups and that mobility has declined within every age group. Thus, the overall decline in the mobility rate (age 25+) is due to a combination of population aging and mobility falling within every age group.</p>
