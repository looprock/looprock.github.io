            Apple will release its first MacBooks based on TSMC's 3nm fabrication process in 2024, not this year as some rumors have suggested. That's according to a new five-year global notebook shipments forecast published by <em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20231011VL209/digitimes-research-2023-notebook-shipments.html">DigiTimes</a></em>.

            Apple today seeded the third beta of an upcoming tvOS 17.1 to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming a week after the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-seeds-tvos-17-1-beta-2-to-developers/">second tvOS 17.1 beta</a>.
