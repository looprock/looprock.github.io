            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Netflix today quietly eliminated its most <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926">affordable ad-free plan</a> in the United States and the United Kingdom, raising the price of ad-free streaming options.

<br/>
In the U.S., the Basic plan was priced at $9.99 per month, and with its removal, ad-free streaming now starts at $15.49 per month. Netflix subscribers can opt for the $6.99 per month "Standard with ads" plan, but that price point includes advertisements.

<br/>
New customers who want an ad-free streaming experience will now need to pay $5.50 more without the Basic plan. As noted by <em><a href="https://www.cordbusters.co.uk/netflix-pricing-basic-tier-axed-uk-us/">Cord Busters</a></em>, this shift will put more focus on Netflix's ad-supported plan, and it is a move that the company already teste [...]<br>

            Apple is working on "Apple GPT" artificial intelligence projects that could rival OpenAI's ChatGPT, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/apple-preps-ajax-generative-ai-apple-gpt-to-rival-openai-and-google">Bloomberg</a></em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 17 and iPadOS 17, Apple has added a new Siri ability that means you can get the virtual assistant to read web articles aloud to you just like an audiobook, even if your device is locked. Keep reading to learn how it's done on iPhone and iPad.

If you tend to be put off by the thought of reading long-form articles on the web on a small screen, we have good news for you. In iOS 17, Siri can read them out loud for you, meaning all you have to do is listen.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/spectre-camera/id1450074595">Spectre</a>, the long-exposure AI-powered iPhone camera app made by the developers of the popular Halide photography app, is now free.

<br/>
For those unfamiliar with Spectre, the app uses a computational shutter to take hundreds of photos over the course of a few seconds to create an up to 3-second long exposure. 
<br/>
<br/>
Because it's taking hundreds of images instead of one continuous shot, users can hold their phone while taking long exposure images with Spectre, no tripod necessary.
<br/>
<br/>
Previously $1.99, the app's switch to freeware marks the introduction of a new paid-for Pro version, which includes additional 15- and 30-second exposure modes, plus a new Pro icon.

<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Titled "Swiped," the spot opens with a design team that is shortly about to give a "game-changing" presentation to a client, only for the MacBook Air on which the presentation exists to be swiped by thieves in the street when the team leader turns her back.
<br/>
<br/>
The eight-minute video follows the team's attempt to retrieve the stolen Mac in time for the crucial presentation before the bumbling thieves can pawn it off. 
<br/>
<br/>
The film showcases several Apple security features that aid the team and thwart the thieves, including Notify When Left Behind, Find My location tracking, Touch ID and Face ID, passwords and passkeys, Secure Enclave, end-to-end encryption, MDM Remote Lock and Remote Wipe, remote Erase This Device, and more.
