            Apple's upcoming iPhone 15 Pro models will likely be more expensive than the current models, according to Tim Long, an analyst at British bank Barclays. Long said this information is based on conversations with supply chain companies in Asia.

In a research note this month, obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>, Long said he expects the iPhone 15 Pro to cost up to $100 more than the iPhone 14 Pro, and the iPhone 15 Pro Max to be $100 to $200 more expensive than the iPhone 14 Pro Max. He believes pricing will remain similar for the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models.

Based on Long's estimates, pricing for the iPhone 15 lineup in the U.S. could be as follows:<ul><li><strong>iPhone 15:</strong> $799 (unchanged)</li>
