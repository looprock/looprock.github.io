<br/>
The rumor has since been corroborated <a href="https://x.com/MarkozNewz/status/1927801836305621295">by <em>AppleInsider</em>'s Marko Zivkovic</a>.

This dance continues for a while.

            In the United States, the Apple Card offers a high-yield savings account option, allowing you to earn far more interest on your money compared to the average bank's basic savings account. However, the account's interest rate was lowered this week, with the annual percentage yield (APY) <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-card-savings-account-rate-lowered-again/">dropping from 3.75% to 3.65%</a>.

<br/>
If you deposited $1,000 into the account, and maintained that balance for one year, you would earn $36.50 in interest based on the current APY.
