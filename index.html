            <b>Published:</b> 2024-07-26 13:03:04-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Social network X (formerly Twitter) recently activated a setting that gives it permission to train Grok AI on user tweets. All X users are opted in by default, with X failing to notify customers about the change.

<br/>
The hidden setting gives X permission to use all posts, interactions, inputs, and results for "training and fine-turning" Elon Musk's Grok AI model.

<blockquote>To continuously improve your experience, we may utilize your X posts as well as your user interactions, inputs and results with Grok for training and fine-tuning purposes. This also means that your interactions, inputs, and results may also be shared with our service provider xAI for these purposes. Learn more</blockquote>

While X turned the setting on for all users by default, it can be turned off on the website. Here's how:

            <p>Like in many companies, you probably have some databases lying around that are starting to cost a lot in terms of storage. You are paying more and more every week; the more you wait, the more money will be spent for nothing. It’s time for a cleanup.</p><p>The basic approach is to write a script that will scan your DB and delete the items that aren’t useful anymore (e.g., really old data).</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong> that can be extremely expensive with Dynamo DB, so expensive that it will take years to pay off…</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> One way to tackle this is to migrate all the data you need to a new table. From there, you can delete your old data altogether (which is free). This way, you pay only to migrate the data you need, which is usually a small percentage of your total table.</p><p>In this post I’ll do a small overview of how we did that at Medium and the tools we used to estimate the costs of the different scenarios.</p><figure>&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024</figure> [...]<br>
