            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has filed a court motion to dismiss Elon Musk's lawsuit alleging the company conspired with OpenAI to stifle competition in the AI market, arguing the antitrust claims are based on "speculation on top of speculation."

<br/>
In a Texas filing Tuesday, Apple's lawyers defended the company's decision to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, claiming it did nothing wrong in selecting OpenAI as its initial generative AI partner. The filing says it is "widely known that Apple intends to partner with other generative AI chatbots" beyond OpenAI in the future.
<br/>
<br/>
The motion likely refers to reports that Apple is working to integrate other chatbots like Gemini into ‌Siri. Indeed, Google CEO Sundar Pichai earlier this year commented about talks with Apple  [...]<br>

Localized cloud options, including sovereign clouds and regional vendors, can help meet legal requirements without compromising agility. A surgical approach to sovereignty ensures strategic alignment and cost-effectiveness.”</p>

The new speakers have faster chips with AI acceleration, and a custom sensor platform called Omnisense. Omnisense was created for ambient AI, and it leverages sensors and signals to act on events that are happening in the home.

            The United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has seemingly confirmed Apple's work on an updated version of the Vision Pro headset.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1021632" height="626" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/fcc-vision-pro-leak.jpg" width="1110"/>
<br/>
One of several documents the FCC shared today references an Apple-designed "Head Mounted Device" with a model number of A3416. An included image confirms the device is a Vision Pro.
<br/>
<br/>
The FCC's uploads are transmission tests, SAR test reports, and WLAN test reports, so there's not a lot of additional product information available. We do know that the next Vision Pro will continue to have Wi-Fi 6, as there's no sign of 6GHz Wi-Fi in the testing that the FCC did.

<br/>
The FCC published documents that reference model numbers that do not correspond with existing devices. A3434, for example, references an unreleased ‌MacBook Pro‌, while other numbers are likely for upcoming M5 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models. The FCC doesn't include product names in the documents that it shared, but we can guess based on the model numbers of current devices, and we do already know that the A3360 model number is an M5 ‌iPad Pro‌.

            OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/sora-2/">today announced</a> the launch of Sora, an invite-only AI video app and social network. Sora lets you create realistic AI videos of yourself, friends, and other people.

<br/>
Sora uses the Sora 2 video generation model, which OpenAI says is more physically accurate, realistic, and controllable than prior systems. It is able to generate complex movements while better obeying the laws of physics, and OpenAI says it excels at realistic, cinematic, and anime styles.

<br/>
Sora 2 supports generating video that also includes audio, such as real-sounding speech, background soundscapes, and sound effects.

The same YouTube account <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/alleged-m4-macbook-pro-unboxing-video/">leaked the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 chip</a> before it was announced by Apple last year, so this is likely a legitimate leak.

Based on the box shown in the video, this appears to be a 13-inch iPad Pro with an M5 chip, 256GB of storage, and a Space Black finish. The new iPad Pro does not have any noticeable external design changes compared to the current models with the M4 chip, with features like a single rear camera, four speakers, and a Smart Connector still visible.

            Generative AI agents in production environments demand resilience strategies that go beyond traditional software patterns. AI agents make autonomous decisions, consume substantial computational resources, and interact with external systems in unpredictable ways. These characteristics create failure modes that conventional resilience approaches might not address. This post presents a framework for AI agent resilience risk analysis […]<br>

            Logitech today announced an updated version of its MX Master series mouse, the <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/mx-master-4">MX Master 4</a>, which features haptic feedback and introduces a few other changes while remaining largely faithful to the original design.

<br/>
Apart from cleaner-looking frosted buttons and a more minimalist bottom, the MX Master 4 looks very similar to the S3. The feel is, however, slightly different – the new model swaps its predecessor's soft, ribbed finish for a smooth, hard-plastic body and buttons, although there is some softer material around the right-hand side and on the surface where you rest your thumb.

The new haptic feedback delivers subtle vibrations near the thumb for scrolling, navigation, and selection. Haptics also accompany gestures and shortcuts accessed [...]<br>

Sleep apnea is a condition in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep, often leading to poor rest.

            <p>&lsquo;JFrog Fly is the company’s agentic developer platform and an MCP server that works with multiple IDEs, including VS Code and Cursor. Integrated with GitHub and observability, Fly provides a chat interface that allows users to query, promote, and roll back existing releases based on specifics of the code (e.g., “Which features were added to this release?” or “Deploy the release that added styling to the user field”). Fly includes an audacious reimagining of the software development process, making versioning automatic and version names obsolete. This makes for a slick demo but may introduce confusion for JFrog clients who don’t want to give up their semantic versions or who need to support back-level software.&rsquo;</p>
