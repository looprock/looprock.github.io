The low volume affects both phone calls and music, according to the complaints.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple plans to release a MacBook Air with an improved LCD display in 2027, featuring Oxide TFT technology instead of the current amorphous silicon (a-Si) panels, according to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=32837">The Elec</a></em>.

The new display technology is said to be a significant upgrade over current MacBook Air screens. Oxide TFT LCD panels offer better power efficiency and improved performance compared to traditional a-Si displays, resulting in sharper images, smoother scrolling, and enhanced battery life.

Samsung Display is said to be currently producing test samples of the OLED panels on its first deposition machine, which was installed in November 2024.
