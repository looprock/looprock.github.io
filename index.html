            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iPadOS 18 will drop support for iPad models equipped with the A10X Fusion chip, according to a post on X today from a private account with a proven track record of sharing build numbers for upcoming iOS and iPadOS updates.

<br/>
This means that iPadOS 18 would not be compatible with the first-generation 10.5-inch iPad Pro or the second-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro models released in 2017. It almost certainly means that iPadOS 18 would drop support for iPad models powered by the regular A10 Fusion chip too, including the sixth-generation and seventh-generation iPads.

The current iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus use low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) panels, while Apple's iPhone 15 Pro models use more advanced low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) panels. LTPO panels support ProMotion, allowing the display to ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video content when required.

ProMotion also allows the display to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate as low as 1Hz, which is why the iPhone 15 Pro screens feature an always-on capability that shows the Lock Screen's clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even wh [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In 2023, Apple didn't make any updates to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> lineup, and it's been even longer since the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> was refreshed. Apple last unveiled a new ‌iPad Air‌ in March 2022, so we're at the two-year mark and it's overdue for an update. Luckily, rumors suggest that we're going to get new iPads as soon as March, and there are exciting changes in store for the Air lineup.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Netflix subscribers who still pay their monthly fees through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> in-app purchase system will soon need to add a new payment method to keep their accounts active, Netflix is telling customers.

<br/>
Though Netflix stopped allowing customers to subscribe to its streaming service on iOS devices <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/12/28/netflix-no-more-itunes-billing-options/">way back in 2018</a>, it has allowed customers that were already subscribed that way to continue using in-app purchase to pay. Payment through Apple's platform is set to stop, however, because Netflix does not want to continue to pay Apple a 15 percent cut of those subscription fees.
