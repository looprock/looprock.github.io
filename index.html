            Rich Communication Services (RCS) is a messaging standard Apple adopted in iOS 18 that is significantly enhancing the messaging experience between iPhone and Android devices. Think of it as SMS 2.0 – a major upgrade to the traditional text messaging we've been using for years.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            While this should come as no surprise given that Apple just <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-announces-new-airpods-max/">updated the AirPods Max in September</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-11-24/apple-should-build-fire-tv-chromecast-rival-llm-siri-plans-oura-glucose-push-m3vnimbg"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman today said</a> that Apple currently has "no concrete plans" to update the headphones again "in a meaningful way."

<br/>
"I expect the company to keep the Max headphones around for the foreseeable future in their current form," he added.

AirPods Max received only two changes in September, including a USB-C charging port instead of Lightning, and new color options. The headphones did not receive Apple's H2 chip that debuted in the AirPods Pro 2 a few years [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-11-23 08:36:57-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            For the first time in nearly a decade, Apple is able to repair individual MacBook Pro speakers without replacing other components too.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979210" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/2024-MacBook-Pro-Space-Black.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
In a memo shared with Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers this week, Apple said it is offering speakers as standalone repair parts for the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with the M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips. This is the first time Apple has made individual MacBook Pro speaker parts available since 2015.
<br/>
<br/>
For all MacBook Pro models released between 2016 and 2023, Apple replaces the entire "top case" with the battery and other components for speaker repairs. This results in out-of-warranty speaker repairs costing hundreds of dollars more than they should, so standalone speaker parts will make these repairs far more affordable.

            Introduction: Welcome to Episode 6 of the Fearless Concurrency in Rust series! In this episode, we explore the powerful concept of ARC (Atomic Reference Counting) and its critical role in managing shared resources in multithreaded Rust programs. By leveraging ARC, developers can safely share ownership of data across threads without relying on a traditional garbage collector, enabling efficient, flexible, and scalable concurrency.
What is ARC?: Understanding Atomic Reference Counting as a lightweight, manual garbage collection system.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If we plot the metrics associated with large DDoS attacks observed in the last 10 years, does it show a straight, steady increase in an exponential curve that keeps becoming steeper, or is it closer to a linear growth? Our analysis found the growth is not linear but rather is exponential, with the slope varying depending on the metric (rps, pps or bps).<br>
