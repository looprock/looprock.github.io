            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple will begin encouraging artists and record labels to adopt Spatial Audio with royalty incentives, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-11/apple-dangles-reward-for-musicians-to-use-high-end-audio-format"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reports.

<br/>
Citing sources familiar with the matter, <em>Bloomberg</em> says that Apple will prioritize streams of songs mixed in Dolby Atmos technology in its streaming calculations starting next year. The change will result in higher royalty payments for artists and labels that adopt and expand the technology in their catalogs. Listeners do not have to listen to the Spatial Audio version of a song for artists to be eligible for the added benefits, with the availability of tracks in Dolby Atmos being sufficient.
