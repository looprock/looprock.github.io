Far from just a title and description, a price and a few images, over the years the listing screen has come to aggregate ratings and reviews, seller and shipping and stock information, and gained a variety of personalization and recommendation features. As information-rich as it is, as central as it is to the buying experience, for product teams the listing screen is an irresistible place to test out new methods and approaches. In just the last three years, apps teams have run nearly 200 experiments on it, often with multiple teams building and running experiments in parallel.</p>

<br/>
If this information is accurate, the front camera on the next iPad Air would be located in the bezel to the right of the screen when the device is held upright. As a result, the front camera would be positioned at the top of the iPad when the device is in landscape orientation, making it centered with the user's eyes during video calls. This change would be especially beneficial to those who use the iPad Air with a Magic Keyboard.
<br/>
<br/>
On the current iPad Air, the front camera is in the top bezel above the screen, resulting in it being off-center in landscape orientation.
