            <b>Published:</b> 2023-09-09 12:55:07+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p><strong>One of the biggest threats to the Bitcoin experiment is mining centralization. Gone are the days in which China controlled 60% of hash power, and a single mining pool could get close to the dangerous 50% range. However, there are still centralizing forces at work.</strong> From the ASICs market to the mining pools to the big miners edging out the small ones, centralization comes from all angles. Will the <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> network resist and react to the pressure that this generates? History says it probably will.</p>
<p>\
Two companies, both Chinese, control the ASIC market with an iron fist. Plus, all of its current competitors are in China as well. That’s not healthy for the bitcoin network. It’s one of those single points of failure, in fact. On their consumer’s end, the industrialization of Bitcoin mining brings firmness, strength, and other positive aspects to the network. It also discourages home mining since the competition is so vast and well-capita</p> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>I’m slowly getting tired of writing about the Fed's aggressive rate hike that has been rambling on since March 2022. The fact of the matter is that we are slowly but surely inching closer to the target of 2%. Right now, real-time data from <strong><a href="https://truflation.com/">Truflation</a></strong> shows a current inflation rate of 2.59%.</p>
<p>This should warrant that a shift in monetary policy could be around the corner. However, the latest data from the CME FedWatch Tool is pricing a probability of over 40% for another rate hike in November.</p>

<h3 id="chinasnothelping">China’s not helping.</h3>
<p>There are more than a few things happening in China to look out for. First, China fell short of growth estimates for Q2 of 2023, which in itself would not be so concerning were it not for the fact that its real estate market is showing severe signs of weakness.</p>

What makes some teams do exceptionally well and others perform poorly? Do they have more talented team members and better resources, or are they simply lucky?</p>
<p>\
Teams that stand out are not more talented, better skilled, or have greater opportunities. What sets them apart are their habits and practices.</p>
<p>\
Empowering work culture, support from leaders in the organization, and clarity of vision and goals are important, but they’re not sufficient to drive excellence and high performance in teams.</p>
<p>\
Building extraordinary workplaces with high-performing teams requires more than hiring the right talent and equipping them with the right opportunities. It requires cultivating the right habits and incorporating them into daily work and life.</p>
