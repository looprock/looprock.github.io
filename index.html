            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has agreed to pay Samsung twice as much for the LPDDR5X memory chips that it needs for ongoing iPhone 17 production, claims a report from Korean outlet <em><a href="https://dealsite.co.kr/articles/157475">Dealsite</a></em>.

<br/>
According to the report's sources, Apple recently held emergency meetings with Samsung's semiconductor division to negotiate delivery volumes of RAM for the first half of this year. The 12GB LPDDR5X modules used in the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro have already roughly doubled in price since early 2025, rising from around $30 to approximately $70.
<br/>
<br/>
Samsung is said to have originally planned to push for a 60% price increase on LPDDR5X modules supplied to Apple. Instead, however, Samsung opened with a 100% markup as a negotiating tactic – and Apple apparently accepted it on the spot.

            <b>Published:</b> 2026-02-22 10:22:00+01:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Most organizations treat infrastructure as a series of projects to be &ldquo;completed,&rdquo; but successful platform engineering requires a permanent product mindset. In this episode, we explore why platform teams need dedicated product management to balance competing priorities—like security, cost, and developer experience—and why the &ldquo;why&rdquo; scales much better than the &ldquo;what&rdquo; in large enterprises. We also dive into the often-overlooked role of designers in creating platform tools that developers actually want to use.</p>
<p>Tanzu Catsup is a weekly conversation about platform engineering, cloud-native operations, and building software in large organizations. We follow the work wherever it actually leads.</p>
