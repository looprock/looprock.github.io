            With iOS 18.2 and iPadOS 18.2, Apple introduced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/">Genmoji</a>, the feature that lets you create a custom emoji character if there's not already an emoji that exists for what you want to depict.

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-975006" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Genmoji-Feature-2.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
You can create ‌Genmoji‌ from the emoji keyboard in Messages, Notes, and more, and the characters work much like emoji. ‌Genmoji‌, like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/">Image Playground</a>, have significant restrictions put in place to prevent people from creating objectionable images, and these guardrails can make it hard to make what you're looking for.
<br/>
<br/>
‌Genmoji‌ are anything but open-ended, so I thought I'd highlight some of what you can and can't do with the custom emojis as of right now.
