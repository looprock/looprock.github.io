            AirPods Max are the oldest current-generation AirPods product still in Apple's lineup. It's been almost three years since Apple launched AirPods Max in December 2020, and only recently have we begun hearing rumors about Apple's plans for a new-generation model next year.

Files in Proton Drive are synced on-demand, meaning they don't take up space on the local computer until they are needed.
