            Apple Fellow Phil Schiller testified in court on Monday that he initially opposed the 27% commission Apple now charges on purchases made outside the App Store, citing compliance risks and potential developer backlash (via <em><a href="https://apnews.com/article/apple-iphone-app-store-epic-antitrust-e4ae4eed9fde0ae42bd2576133af1c20">AP News</a></em>).

            Graphics benchmarks for Apple's yet-to-be announced MacBook Air models with M4 processors have popped up on Geekbench, giving us an idea of how much faster the GPU component of Apple's second-generation 3-nanometer chips are compared to the existing M3 models.
