The new feature allows the AI chatbot to make changes to code without requiring users to copy and paste between applications. ChatGPT can now read code from these environments and make edits directly within them.

An optional "auto-apply" mode enables ChatGPT to implement changes without additional clicks.

            Apple has increased the thickness of the upcoming iPhone 17 Pro Max compared to the current generation iPhone 16 Pro Max, claims the Chinese leaker known as <a href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/PhqFQjY5b">Ice Universe</a>.

Apple is said to have increased the depth of the iPhone 17 Pro Max to 8.725mm, up from 8.25mm on the iPhone 16 Pro Max, which would be a 0.475mm difference in thickness. The increase "surely means a larger battery," according to the leaker. Apart from depth, the iPhone 17 Pro Max's frame reportedly <a href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/PhqQrs9PB">remains unchanged</a>, and is otherwise identical to the iPhone 16 Pro Max.
<br/>

Up until now, we have not heard any rumors about a battery life increase for the iPhone 17 Pro Max or a change in dimensions, so if Ice Universe's information is accu [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air shares the same dimensions as the iPhone 17 Pro Max, with the only difference being in the thickness of the devices, according to the leaker Ice Universe.

<br/>
Posting to their <a href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/PhqSED0hS">Weibo account</a>, the Chinese leaker today claimed that the iPhone 17 Air and iPhone 17 Pro Max have identical body length, width, screen size, and bezels. "The only difference is the thickness," added the leaker. "The iPhone 17 Air is 5.5mm thick, while the iPhone 17 Pro Max is 8.725mm thick." 
<br/>
<br/>
If these dimension are accurate, they also suggest that the iPhone 17 Pro Max will itself be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/iphone-17-pro-max-thicker-larger-battery/">substantially thicker</a> than the existing iPhone 16 Pro M [...]<br>

            Apple is developing a "refreshed" version of its C1 modem for mass production next year that will improve power consumption and transmission speed, as well as bring support for mmWave, according to industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

In a <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1897580253708759208">post on X (Twitter)</a>, Kuo said that while supporting the mmWave baseband isn't particularly challenging, achieving stable performance with low power consumption remains a "key hurdle" for Apple.

The C1 modem that debuted in the iPhone 16e lacks support for ultra-fast mmWave 5G technology.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-05 09:04:26+01:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p><em>One bad apple ruins the bunch.</em></p>
<p>The O-Ring Theory, proposed by economist Michael Kremer in 1993, describes how small failures in complex, interdependent tasks can lead to major breakdowns. Named after the Challenger disaster, where a faulty O-ring caused the shuttle’s destruction, this model applies to production, labor markets, and economic development.</p>
<p>In an O-ring system, tasks must be performed at a consistently high level because a single weak link can compromise the entire process. This leads to high-skill clustering, where talented workers seek equally skilled colleagues, reinforcing economic inequality between firms, industries, and countries.</p>
<p>For example, in tech, a bad developer in a high-stakes project can introduce critical bugs, limiting the success of even the best engineers. This explains why top companies attract and retain top talent—because output depends on every link in the chain functioning well. It also highlights the challenge of improving productivity in</p> [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-05 09:00:33+01:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Median Voter Theory (MVT) suggests that in a majority-rule election, the candidate closest to the median voter’s views will win. Since most voters are partisan and vote predictably, elections are decided by swing voters in the middle. To win, candidates adjust their positions to attract this decisive group, often moving toward the political center.</p>
<p>Developed by Anthony Downs in 1957, MVT explains why general election candidates tend to sound more moderate than during primaries, where they appeal to their base. Over time, this leads to policy convergence, with major parties offering similar centrist policies.</p>
<p>However, MVT assumes politics follows a single left-right spectrum, ignores low voter turnout, and struggles in polarized environments, where candidates may focus more on energizing their base than winning the middle. Despite these flaws, MVT remains a key theory in understanding why democratic elections often favor centrist policies over extreme positions.</p>
