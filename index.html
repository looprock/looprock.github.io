            iOS 26 introduces a new Liquid Glass design, but the update also includes some other new features that have not received as much attention.
<br/>
<br/>

Below, we recap three smaller iOS 26 features that you might have missed.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26 should be released in September, but anyone can <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/install-ios-26-public-beta-on-your-iphone/">sign up to test the public beta for free</a>. Make sure to back up your iPhone first.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-09 17:33:53-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iPhone 17 models will "likely" be more expensive than iPhone 16 models in the U.S., according to Jeff Pu, an analyst at investment firm GF Securities.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-998158" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/iPhone-17-Pro-on-Desk-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
In a research note this week, Pu attributed the potential iPhone 17 price increases to the U.S. imposing tariffs on products imported from countries where the iPhone is assembled, including China and India. Apple is currently paying a 20% tariff on iPhones imported from China, but none on iPhones imported from India, according <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-iphones-india-trump-tariffs-789c7209">to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>. However, the Trump administration's tariff policies frequently change.

It turns out that Majin Bu was not the only source to make such a claim this week, as another leaker known as DuanRui also shared a CAD of an alleged iPhone 17 Pro case with two spots to attach a lanyard, in the bottom corners.
