            Apple is preparing to launch two versions of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a> over 2025 and 2026, according to a Weibo leaker.

<br/>
Yesterday, supply chain analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/07/airpods-pro-3-this-year-per-kuo/">reported</a> that Apple is planning to debut the ‌AirPods Pro 3‌ this year. They could arrive as soon as this week at Apple's "Awe dropping" event. 
<br/>
<br/>
Crucially, Kuo added that Apple is planning to introduce a successor to this year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> in 2026. This would be somewhat unusual since Apple normally waits around three years to make major changes to the AirPods' hardware. ‌AirPods Pro&amp;zw [...]<br>

            Just ahead of Apple unveiling the iPhone 17 series <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/watch-iphone-17-apple-event-sep-9/">on Tuesday</a>, it appears that battery capacities for the devices have surfaced in a Chinese regulatory database.

The table below lists the alleged battery capacities for each model, which were shared in a post on X today <a href="https://x.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1964884846100254931">by an account known as ShrimpApplePro</a>.

The database suggests that the iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will be available with and without a physical SIM card tray, depending on the country of sale. On the other hand, the base-model iPhone 17 might have only one battery size, as only a single capacity for that device has been discovered so far.

<br/>
Here are the alleged devices that the account mentioned:<ul><li>Apple Watch Series 11 with a chip based on the same architecture as the S9 and S10 chips in previous Apple Watch models</li>

<li>Apple Watch Ultra 3 with a chip based on the same architecture as the S9 and S10 chips</li>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In July 2024, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said he expected Samsung to begin shipping 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera sensors to Apple for iPhones <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/2026-iphone-48mp-camera-sensor-samsung/">as early as 2026</a>, which is when some iPhone 18 models are expected to be released.

<br/>
In a <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1964534143850860987">follow-up post</a> this weekend, however, Kuo said he now expects the first iPhone models with Samsung's sensor to be released in 2027. In other words, this rumor seemingly now applies to some iPhone 19 models, instead of iPhone 18 models.
<br/>
<br/>
It is also possible that Samsung's sensor could debut on the iPhone 18e in early 2027, but the iPhone 16e does not have an Ultra Wide rear camera currently.
