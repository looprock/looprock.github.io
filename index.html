You can add up to 12 choices in a poll, and then send it to people in a conversation to vote on. If you send a poll and someone thinks an option is missing, they can even edit it and add in another choice.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple for its 20th anniversary iPhone will adopt a Samsung-made OLED technology called COE (Color Filter on Encapsulation) to make the display brighter and thinner than previous panels, reports <em><a href="https://www.etnews.com/20250919000194">ETNews</a></em>.

<br/>
In a traditional OLED panel, a polarizing film sits above the display to cut reflections and improve contrast. The drawback is that this film also absorbs some of the OLED's own light, reducing brightness and efficiency. With COE, Apple would remove the polarizer entirely and instead apply the color filter directly onto the OLED's protective encapsulation layer.
<br/>
<br/>
The result would be a thinner display stack that lets more light through, delivering higher brightness without requiring more power. Removing layers would also mean less thicknes [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has stopped signing iOS 18.6.2, which means that if you've upgraded to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, you're no longer able to downgrade to a version of iOS 18. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/15/apple-releases-ios-26/">released iOS 26</a> a week ago.

<br/>
When software is "signed," it means that it has passed a server-side verification check that Apple performs when a new version of iOS is downloaded on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. An update can't be installed unless it passes the verification check.
<br/>

Unsigning software prevents Apple customers from installing outdated, less secure versions of iOS.

One day, teams are focused on deployment velocity and infrastructure automation, the next day, they&#8217;re expected to understand threat modeling, vulnerability management and compliance frameworks. This shift isn&#8217;t happening by choice — it&#8217;s happening because traditional security approaches can&#8217;t keep pace [&#8230;]<br>

            <p>Kubernetes CPU limits can look straightforward on the surface, but their impact on application performance is anything but simple. This article unpacks how Go services interact with Kubernetes CPU throttling and why a seemingly harmless configuration such as setting a limit of 250m can dramatically constrain performance in production. First published in February 2024, its insights remain just as relevant today for anyone running Go applications in containerized environments and for developers who want to avoid costly slowdowns.</p><br>
