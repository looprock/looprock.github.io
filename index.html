            Apple's third Apple silicon <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> gains the M4 chip alongside a range of other small but notable improvements, so how does the new machine compare to its two predecessors?

The 2021 ‌iMac‌ was the first of its kind to feature an Apple silicon chip, replacing previous Intel-based models with 21.5- and 27-inch displays. It offered an all-new ultra-thin design, a 24-inch Retina display, a six-speaker system with force-cancelling woofers, and an array of seven two-tone color options. The 2023 model was a minor update that added the M3 chip and specification updates like Bluetooth 5.3 and Wi-Fi 6E. One year later, the latest, M4 version of the device looks like a much more substantial upgrade, offering a dramatically more powerful Neural Engine, 16GB of memory as stand [...]<br>

In this episode, we explore how Rust’s ownership and borrowing rules impact multithreaded programming, focusing on the complexities of managing memory in a concurrent environment. We’ll break down how Rust&rsquo;s strict borrowing and ownership model ensures safety and prevents common pitfalls like data races and undefined behavior, making it an ideal choice for building reliable multithreaded applications.
