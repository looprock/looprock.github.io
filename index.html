            <p>You need a proxy for enterprise AI</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google Cloud suggests using a centralized proxy to mediate all communication between clients and remote MCP servers. This proxy enforces access control, audit logging, secret policies, and secure transport, helping reduce the attack surface by having one enforced point rather than many decentralized servers. In addition, Google emphasizes identifying particular risk vectors like unauthorized tool exposure, session hijacking, and weak authentication, and treating identity, transport, and policy enforcement as foundational rather than optional.</p>

<p>Step one in using AI in enterprises (MCP or just plain access to inference): get a proxy. It feels like this will get all your KPI&rsquo;s for the next 12 months done. Stop farting around, and put one in place.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today released a new Developer Strap for the Vision Pro, on the same day as the Vision Pro with an M5 chip <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/22/m5-macbook-pro-ipad-pro-vision-pro-now-available/">became available to purchase at Apple Stores</a>.

<br/>
The second-generation Developer Strap offers data transfer speeds of up to 20 Gbps when connected to a Mac, whereas <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-selling-vision-pro-developer-strap/">the original version</a> was limited to USB 2.0 speeds of up to 480 Mbps. It is unclear if there are any other changes.

The overall design of the Developer Strap has barely changed, and it continues to provide the same audio experience as the standard Right Audio Strap.

<p>If you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have just one idea you need to communicate, sure. I find &ldquo;just one idea&rdquo; content needs to be very short, a five minute presentation at most or a short blog post.

<p>Tech marketers way undervalue identity as a marketing tactic. It works well, just like in shoes and coffee loyalty.</p>
<p>Stickers. Devrel. Community management. Conference schwag.</p>
<p>We assume that people chose one technology over another based on utility (does it work for what they want), and also price. What we miss is the anchoring that happens before that. What buyers put on the short list to evaluate in PoC’s. They put things they identify with, and some throw-away choices. They then go through a lot of work to build up a case for choosing the tech they want, that they identify with.</p>
<p>There’s exceptions, of course, but I think this identity effect drives the majority of decision making.</p>
