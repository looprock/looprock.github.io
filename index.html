            Apple's 15-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> doesn't have a fan, and instead uses a passive heat spreader to conduct heat away from Apple's energy efficient <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip. Curious to know if performance could be further improved with an active cooling solution, <a href="https://www.froresystems.com">Frore Systems</a> installed its own novel solid-state active cooling system into the laptop and subjected it to several benchmarks, with some impressive results.

If you have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> ‌iMac‌, you're not going to notice any physical differences between the old model and the new model with the M3 chip, because Apple didn't make any updates to the design or the color offerings.

As a minor update, iOS 17.1.2 should be focused on bug fixes, but it's unclear exactly which issues might be addressed. Some users have continued to experience Wi-Fi issues on iOS 17.1.1, so perhaps iOS 17.1.2 will include the same <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/ios-17-2-beta-addresses-wifi-issues/">fix for Wi-Fi connectivity issues</a> that Apple already included in the iOS 17.2 beta.

Sonos very rarely offers straight cash discounts on individual products, with typical sales throughout the year focusing on bundle sales. For Cyber Monday, the company is finally back with steep markdowns on numerous products, and you don't need to bundle or enter a code for the savings.
