            Multiple celebrities have been spotted with a new version of the Beats Pill speaker, and today the device showed up in an FCC database, suggesting that we're getting closer to a potential launch.

<br/>
FCC filings typically happen just weeks ahead of when a product launches, so we could see this new Beats Pill speaker sometime in June. Apple plans to launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-buds-announced/">Solo Buds earphones</a> in June, so the Pill could launch around the same timeframe.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple has clearly provided these Beats Pill speakers to a number of sports stars and celebrities to create hype for it, and the speaker has been seen with basketball star LeBron James, F1 driver Daniel Ricciardo, soccer star Lionel Messi, and Kim Kardashian.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today filed a pre-motion letter seeking to dismiss the antitrust case that the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) levied against Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/21/apple-sued-by-us-department-of-justice/">back in March</a>.

<br/>
In the pre-motion letter, Apple says that the government's lawsuit is flawed in multiple ways, and has not successfully alleged that Apple is a monopoly power in the relevant market, proven anticompetitive conduct, or demonstrated consumer harm. From Apple's filing:
<br/>
<blockquote>This case lies well beyond the outer limits of antitrust law. A Section 2 Sherman Act claim can move past the pleadings only if the complaint alleges (1) monopoly power in a relevant market; (2) anticompetitive conduct; and (3) anticompetitive effects. [...]
<br/>
<br/>
This complaint fails</blockquote> [...]<br>
