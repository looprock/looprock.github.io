            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-12 08:21:57-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In a <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/UeiC07s0qRrd1L">research note</a> today, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that MacBook Pro models with M5 chips might not launch until 2026.
<br/>

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974025" height="2160" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-MacBook-Pro-M4-hero.jpg" width="3840"/>
<br/>
Kuo discussed how the A20 chips in iPhone 18 models will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/iphone-18-pro-a20-chip-with-new-design/">packaged with WMCM (Wafer-Level Multi-Chip Module) technology</a>, which integrates the so-called "underfill and molding processes" for more efficient manufacturing and increased yield, a term that refers to the percentage of functional chips that can be obtained per silicon wafer.
<br/>
<br/>
Kuo went on to say that high-end M5 chips in 2026 MacBooks — likely referring to the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips — will continue to have separate underfill and molding processes during pro [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-12 08:19:22-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's Wallet app in iOS 26 includes a new feature that lets you store physical card information alongside your digital payment cards. This allows you to quickly access account numbers, expiry dates, and other details without carrying the physical card.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899453" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Wallet-16x9.jpeg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
It's a simple addition in iOS 26, but it brings the Wallet app closer to being a comprehensive card management tool, filling the gap that third-party apps like 1Password typically fill. With the full card information to hand, you can check your card's expiry date for a subscription service or provide account details over the phone, without needing to dig through your physical wallet or memorize card numbers. It also means you don't have to delve into settings to find Safari's Autofill fields.

Federal judge Jonathan Beach found that both companies had broken the law by misusing their market power in the way they run their app stores. Apple was ruled to have engaged in conduct that prevents direct downloading or sideloading of apps and blocks developers from using alternative payment methods. Google was also found to have breached the law for the similar Google Play billing system.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Elon Musk has threatened legal action against Apple, claiming that the company is violating antitrust rules by favoring OpenAI's ChatGPT in App Store rankings over his Grok AI assistant.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-876046" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/app-store-awards-2022.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
"Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation. xAI will take immediate legal action," Musk said in a <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1955073616996975095">post</a> on X (Twitter), which he also owns. 
<br/>
<br/>
Musk failed to provide evidence to support his claim. Meanwhile, fellow X users noted that DeepSeek reached #1 overall on the App Store in January, long after Apple's partnership with OpenAI was announced that allows Siri to offload complex queries to ChatGPT.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-12 03:43:01-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 Air will include an A19 Pro chip with a 5-core GPU, according to Weibo leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/5821279480/PFt8mzQAF">Fixed Focus Digital</a>. The Chinese account, which has over two million followers, claims that only the iPhone 17 Pro models will have the full 6-core GPU A19 Pro configuration.

<br/>
It's the second time in as many months that Fixed Focus Digital has claimed to reveal accurate details about the ultra-thin device's chip specifications. The reduced GPU core count suggests Apple is using binned chips based on yields, or may be managing thermal constraints in the slimmer form factor, but most users are unlikely to notice the performance difference during typical usage.
