            At least one iPhone 17 model launching next year will be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip, according <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1851983650965053494">to Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.

<br/>
All current iPhone models are equipped with a combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip supplied by Broadcom, but Kuo expects Apple to equip "nearly all" of its products with its own in-house Wi-Fi chip "within about three years." The analyst said this move would reduce Apple's component costs and further bolster Apple's hardware and software integration.

            The new MacBook Pro models unveiled today feature display brightness enhancements in both bright outdoor lighting and low lighting.

<br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs/">tech specs page</a> says all of the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models have a peak display brightness of 1,000 nits for standard content in bright outdoor lighting, such as on a sunny day. The previous-generation MacBook Pro models have a peak display brightness of 600 nits for standard content, in any lighting conditions.
<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that apps like Vivid allow you to unlock full-screen HDR brightness levels of up to 1,000 nits at any time on MacBook Pro models with the Liquid Retina XDR display, but this will obviously drain your battery faster.
