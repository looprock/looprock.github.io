            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Understanding web application programming interfaces (APIs) is essential in various tech roles. APIs facilitate communication between applications, and HTTP is a foundational protocol. APIs use URLs, HTTP methods (like GET and POST), query parameters, headers, response codes, and response bodies. HTTP headers carry technical details, including cookies for user sessions. Response codes indicate request outcomes, while response bodies hold data. Authorization methods include sessions and API keys. APIs often use JSON or XML for data exchange. Different API architectures, like REST (Representational State Transfer) and GraphQL, offer distinct approaches to structuring endpoints and data interaction.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Blockchain and Islam share striking parallels, both built on trust, transparency, and integrity:

Immutable Records: In blockchain, each transaction is recorded permanently. The Quran, memorized by ‘hafidh’, stays unaltered over centuries.

Decentralized Validation: Blockchain uses ‘Proof of Work/Stake’ to confirm transactions. Similarly, the Quran has a ‘Proof of Recitation’ system during recitations.

Public Ledger and Collective Review: The Tarawih prayer during Ramadan is akin to blockchain’s group validation. Both ensure no falsehood can be inserted unnoticed.

Trust: Blockchain relies on transparency for trust. Islam has ‘Amanah’, teaching responsibility and trustworthiness.

Chain of Truth: The blockchain creates a traceable chain of transactions, much like the passing down of Hadiths in Islam.

Consensus Systems: Blockchain needs consensus of nodes. Islam has ‘Ijma’, requiring scholars to agree on significant matters.

Decentralized Guarding: Quran preservation and resistance to ‘51% attack’ in blockc [...]<br>

BOE, which is supplying OLED displays for the standard iPhone 15 and larger iPhone 15 Plus, is still awaiting conditional approval from Apple.
