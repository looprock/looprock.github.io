            <p>\</p>
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Design patterns in software are helpful for many reasons, but two of the most important are that they give developers a shared vocabulary and offer solutions to commonly encountered problems. They are popularly used in OO languages but not so often thought of in React projects.</p>
<p>\
In this article, I want to explore the Adapter pattern in React. In case you're not familiar with this pattern, I'll start with the classic object-oriented use case as an introduction. Then, I'll introduce an example of the Adapter pattern in action in a popular <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/react">React</a> library.</p>
<p>\
By the end of the article, I want to be able to answer these two questions:</p>
<p>\</p>
<ul>
<li>What are some signals you should pay attention to when writing React components that point towards using the Adapter pattern?</li>
<li>What are some characteristics of components that use the Adapter pattern?</li>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-08-16 14:08:11+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>The React way of dynamically updating a website’s content is different from Vanilla JavaScript. In JavaScript, we do it by directly manipulating DOM, whereas in React, we have a feature called <code>useState</code>.</p>
<p>\
It is one of the built-in hooks in React. It helps us to declare state variables in Functional Components.</p>
<p>\
We pass the initial state to the useState hook, and in return, it gives us a variable with our state value and a function to update the value.</p>
<p>\
Now let’s compare both ways (JavaScript and React) with an example.</p>
<p>\
Suppose you’ve been given a bag filled with five apples and after some time, you are given seven more apples to put into your bag. Now how many apples will you have in your bag?</p>
<p>\
It's 5+7=12, right?</p>
<p>\
Let’s see how we can show this example in both JavaScript and React:</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Knowledge silos, where information is confined to specific parts of an organization, hinder team growth and efficiency. These silos arise from factors like specialized roles, poor communication, and rapid team scaling. Such barriers can lead to project delays, redundant problem-solving, and missed growth opportunities. Senior developers play a pivotal role in combating this by mentoring juniors, maintaining thorough documentation, promoting collaboration, ensuring role redundancy, and fostering open communication. Effective strategies for knowledge transfer include code reviews, workshops, modern tools, and hands-on experiences. True growth comes from sharing knowledge, inspiring others, and breaking down knowledge barriers.<br>

In this article, we'll create a project that posts about rants using Django and Django Rest Framework. We'll use Django's built-in <code>slugify</code> method and override its <code>save()</code> method to automatically create a <strong>slug</strong> for each rant. We'll also use a third-party package called <a href="https://pypi.org/project/drf-writable-nested/">drf-writable-nested</a> to handle the serialization of a <code>ManyToManyField</code> in the model.</p>

We'll start by creating a virtual environment, installing the initial packages, creating the Django project, creating the Django app, and finally doing the initial migrations.</p>
