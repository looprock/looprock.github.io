            <b>Published:</b> 2023-09-20 06:33:28-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-watch-series-9-unveiled/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-apple-watch-ultra-2/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Friday. Ahead of time, select media outlets and YouTube channels have shared the first reviews of the watches.

<br/>
Key new features for both Apple Watch models include brighter displays, up to a 30% faster S9 chip, a "Double Tap" gesture for interacting with the watches without touching the screen, an increased 64GB of internal storage, and more.
<br/>
<br/>
Many reviews agree that the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 are iterative upgrades that likely aren't worth upgrading to from a Series 8 or the original Ultra.

            This week we’re joined by Steve O’Grady, Principal Analyst & Co-founder at RedMonk. The topic today is the definition of open source, the constant pressure on the true definition of the term, and the seemingly small but vocal minority that aim to protect that definition. In Steve’s post Why Open Source Matters, he says “open source is at a crossroads” and there are some seeking to break the definition of open source to one that is more permissive to their desires, and they are closer than ever to achieving that goal.

According to three individuals familiar with the matter talking to <em>CNBC</em>, the feature would have served as a rival to trading apps like Robinhood, allowing users to buy and sell stocks directly from their ‌iPhone‌ in a convenient way.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WhatsApp for iPad finally appears to be nearing a release. In the latest version of WhatsApp Beta for TestFlight, Meta has introduced an option to use WhatsApp on an iPad independently of an iPhone, thanks to an update to its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-whatsapp-account-multiple-phones/">Link a Device</a> feature.
<br/>

<br/>
WhatsApp currently allows users of the encrypted messaging platform to link up to four devices to their account even when their main smartphone is not connected to the internet. Each linked device connects to WhatsApp independently, ensuring that personal messages, media, and calls are end-to-end encrypted. The feature also supports Macs, but not iPads – until now.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Delhivery, a leading fulfillment platform in India, faced challenges in managing massive real-time data volumes for operational decision-making. They migrated their data marts from Amazon Aurora to TiDB, a Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP) database, to overcome scalability, data integrity, and latency issues. TiDB's architecture separated computing from storage, providing easy scaling, ACID compliance, high availability, and real-time analytics. Delhivery's TiDB infrastructure spans multiple availability zones and underwent critical tuning for optimal performance. They reported improved query performance, easy data migration, and strong support from PingCAP. TiDB proved effective in handling high data throughput requirements for real-time data marts at Delhivery.<br>
