            <b>Published:</b> 2024-06-03 09:10:38-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is unlikely to release a foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> before 2027, but it could significantly disrupt the market when it launches, according to Taiwanese research firm <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20240603-12170.html">TrendForce</a>.

<br/>
The report highlights that foldable phones currently represent a mere 1.5% of the smartphone market, with projections suggesting an increase to 4.8% by 2028. Apple is apparently "still evaluating component specifications and performance, with strict requirements for crease and reliability." Screen creasing is an issue that plagues many current foldable devices, raising concerns about long-term durability and the risk of screen damage from debris.

            Justin Long, the face of Apple's iconic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eEG5LVXdKo">"I'm a Mac" commercials</a>, now stars in a short Qualcomm skit promoting Snapdragon-powered PCs.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
At the Computex 2024 keynote, Qualcomm unveiled the new skit featuring Long, who is well-known for his role in Apple's "Get a Mac" commercials nearly two decades ago. Long is depicted as being overwhelmed by a barrage of notifications about app compatibility, low disk space, and battery issues in macOS, prompting him to search for an alternative in the form of a Windows on ARM PC. The ad concludes with Long stating, "Things change," a sentiment echoed by Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon during the event's closing remarks. Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chips debut in new Copilot Plus PCs on June 18.

            Sonos in May decided to get into the headphone market with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/21/hands-on-sonos-ace-headphones/">launch of the Sonos Ace headphones</a>. The $449 Sonos Ace headphones have some enticing design elements and features you won't see in Apple's headphones, so we thought we'd compare them to the $549 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> to see which is ultimately better.

In terms of design, both the Sonos Ace and ‌AirPods Max‌ are over-ear headphones that have a premium look, but the ‌AirPods Max‌ have a fancier feel because of the aluminum material. While Apple opted for brushed aluminum ear cups in a range of colors, Sonos went for recycled plastic in either black or white.

<br/>
First, Apple now considers the iPhone 5s to be an "obsolete" product worldwide, meaning that Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers no longer offer repairs or other hardware service for the device. Apple says it considers a product "obsolete" once seven years have passed since the company last distributed it for sale.

Apple released the iPhone 5s in September 2013, with its key new feature being the Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the Home button. The device also introduced the A7 chip, which was Apple's first iPhone chip with 64-bit architecture.
