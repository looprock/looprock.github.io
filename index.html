            Apple's upcoming iPhone 18 Pro has entered production testing ahead of a launch later this year, a Chinese leaker reported today.

<br/>
In a Weibo post, the leaker account known as "<a href="https://weibo.com/5821279480/QtbXQ1M0b">Fixed Focus Digital</a>" said the Pro models had already entered "mass-production testing," likely referring to late-stage manufacturing validation for the devices ahead of a September launch. 
<br/>
<br/>
February typically aligns with Apple's Design Validation Test (DVT) phase transitioning into early Production Validation Test (PVT). During this period, Apple uses production tooling and activates portions of factory assembly lines to validate manufacturing processes, yields, and quality control, rather than producing units at full scale. Full mass production usually ramps in the summer [...]<br>

Specifically, he said that Apple is testing a "deep red" finish for the two devices.
<br/>
<br/>
If this rumor materializes, it would be the first time that the Pro and Pro Max models ever come in red, and the iPhone 18 Pro models would be the first iPhone models to be available in red since the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-continues-to-abandon-productred/">(PRODUCT)RED</a>.

In this episode, we explore why platform teams need dedicated product management to balance competing priorities—like security, cost, and developer experience—and why the &ldquo;why&rdquo; scales much better than the &ldquo;what&rdquo; in large enterprises. We also dive into the often-overlooked role of designers in creating platform tools that developers actually want to use.</p>

<p>Andreessen specifically predicted that Salesforce would disrupt Oracle. Fourteen years later, Oracle is roughly 2.5x the size of Salesforce. Salesforce sells application logic – workflows, configurations, business rules. Oracle sells infrastructure – databases, middleware, cloud compute. The application layer was always the vulnerable part. The infrastructure layer was always the durable part. Software ate the world. Then it sat around all gluttonous and bloated.

<p>I have the same experience, weekly. In general, using AI for this kind search and analytics has been bad and more time consuming than just doing it myself.</p>
<p>It is especially bad when you hook it up to other services like docs and email.</p>
