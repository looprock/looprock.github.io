            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today introduced a new firmware update for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>. The new firmware is 6A324, up from the 6A300 firmware <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-releases-new-airpods-firmware-2/">released in September</a>.

<br/>
Apple does not provide details on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware, so it is unclear what's new. The <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/106340">limited release notes</a> for the update list only "bug fixes and other improvements."
<br/>
<br/>
Apple also does not offer instructions on how to upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ are powered on and connected to an iOS device or a Mac.

It's unclear how widespread this issue is, but it seems to be very inconsistent, with recent reviews showing for some users and not for others depending on the app. We were able to reproduce the issue on iPhones in the U.S. and Canada, but not on an iPhone the U.K., while the Mac App Store does not appear to be affected whatsoever.
