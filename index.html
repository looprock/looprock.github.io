            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is no longer signing iOS 18.6, making downgrades from iOS 18.6.2 or iOS 18.6.1 to iOS 18.6 impossible. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/apple-releases-ios-18-6-1/">iOS 18.6.1</a> was released a little over a week ago, swiftly followed by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/20/apple-releases-ios-18-6-2-with-security-fixes/">iOS 18.6.2</a> on Wednesday.

<br/>
Apple often stops signing an older version of iOS, usually within a week or two after a new version is released. When an update is no longer signed, it can't be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side software verification check.

By no longer signing a software version, Apple ensures that customers have the latest security improvements and are not vulnerable to known attacks.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            An established Chinese leaker has pushed back against recent rumors suggesting Apple plans to eliminate the Camera Control button from the iPhone 18, instead claiming the company is working to simplify the component to reduce costs.
<br/>
<br/>

According to Weibo leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/Q11QMAvPN">Instant Digital</a>, the Camera Control's pressure-sensitive modules for the iPhone 18 series currently remain in trial production. However, Apple is reportedly removing the capacitive sensor from the current dual-sensor design, and opting instead to rely solely on pressure sensing to achieve all button functions.

The current Camera Control button on iPhone 16 models uses both capacitive and pressure sensors beneath a sapphire crystal surface. The capacitive layer detects touch gestures, while the forc [...]<br>

            Apple's iOS 26 update, currently in beta, introduces a striking visual overhaul with its new Liquid Glass design language. However, if the translucent elements are causing readability issues or you simply prefer a more opaque interface, there's a quick accessibility setting that can help tone things down.

The Liquid Glass design brings transparency effects throughout the system interface and stock apps. On the Home Screen, you'll notice the search bar, dock, and app folders all feature translucent backgrounds.
