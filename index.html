Musk made the comment in response to a tweet asking whether there was a reason to block someone instead of muting someone on the social network.

According to Musk, muting will be the sole way to filter content on Twitter in the future, though there will still be a blocking feature for direct messages. Removing block will allow spam accounts and harassers to inter [...]<br>

<p>The US stock rally has taken a beating over the last few weeks, even with CPI numbers yet again surprised positively, with the year-over-year number coming in at 3.2%, contrary to 3.3% as expected by analysts.</p>

From a price perspective, both the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq look like they are technically rolling over after the S&amp;P valuation came just short of 5% away from reaching the previous all-time high.</p>
<p>Predictions by analysts show a mere 39% chance of one more rate hike during this year, reinforced by the Fed’s statement that “inflation is likely to be subdued for some time” following the FOMC meeting last week.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WhatsApp has released an update allowing iPhone and Android users to send photos over the messaging platform in high resolution, finally addressing the service's low quality image sharing limitation.

<br/>
Previously, WhatsApp users sending photos would see the images automatically compressed and the resolution reduced to 920 x 1280 to save storage space and keep image-sharing fast over low bandwidth data connections. 
<br/>
<br/>
After updating, they'll have the option to send images to friends and family in "HD quality," which equates to 3024 x 4032 resolution. The rollout of the feature was announced by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg via a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/4/videos/2577125352453919/">Facebook post</a>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            TLDR:

In modern high-pressure business environments, building a cohesive and adaptable team is crucial. Effective strategies involve selecting members with intrinsic motivation, stress tolerance, self-confidence, teamwork skills, and relevant experience. A positive working environment, devoid of toxicity, and with a clear sense of impact on business goals, is essential. High pressure impacts teams with breakdowns, fatigue, and personal sacrifices, affecting productivity. Leadership plays a pivotal role in guiding teams, involving monitoring, advice, understanding limits, and removing toxicity. Cultivating resilience involves setting challenging but achievable tasks, expanding psychological capacities, while avoiding setting impossible goals. Ultimately, mastering these strategies can transform high-pressure situations into opportunities for growth and excellence.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The rise of digital assets has led to the emergence of crypto-stealing malware targeting users' devices to exploit vulnerabilities and steal their cryptocurrency. Ransomware encrypts files and demands cryptocurrency ransom; malicious browser extensions secretly collect sensitive information; clippers divert funds by replacing wallet addresses; cryptojacking hijacks devices for mining; remote access Trojans (RATs) grant unauthorized access. To protect against these threats, users should use reputable security software, download from trusted sources, enable 2FA, stay updated, and use offline wallets.

<p>I’ve been off the publishing grid for awhile, even off the consuming the Internet grid. This is a mix of partial vacation, taking care of some family things, an obsession with D&amp;D, and the first break in my workaholic nature for…20…even 30 years?</p>
<p>It is time for a few new habits, rather than swirling around the old ones. The most counter-whatyoudthink is probably to start going into the office more. My work has an OK-good office in upper west Amsterdam. It is a 40 minute bike ride, each way. That amount of biking a day would both give me more exercise than I’ve ever had in my life and also more lazy-mindfulness time than the same.</p>
<p>The office lacks offices, which is the core problem with the anti-WFH people. One, I have a whole desk studio setup for all the videos and podcasts I do. There is no place for that at a regular white-collar office. Two, I b</p> [...]<br>

            One of the common tests for whether something is trademark infringement is whether or not the public will be confused as to association between the infringer and another trademark owner. This typically comes down to several factors, such as the similarity within the uses and, importantly, whether the two entities compete in the same marketplace. [&#8230;]<br>

            Nomad today introduced its most powerful charger to date, the <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/ac-adapter-130w-usb-c">130W USB-C Power Adapter</a> that's equipped with three USB-C PD ports. The 130W adapter joins Nomad's existing 65W, 30W, and 20W adapters.

<br/>
Priced at $110, the 130W Power Adapter features the same design as Nomad's prior adapters, so if you have one of the smaller varieties, you can have a matching set. It's got a sleek black "carbide" enclosure, and it does use GaN (gallium nitride) technology to ensure a compact size.
<br/>

I always find myself wishing Nomad made its accessories in white or other colors, but black is the Nomad aesthetic and it works. I can say without hesitation that this is the snazziest charging brick I've used, though I have to admit I don't often think too much about the  [...]<br>
