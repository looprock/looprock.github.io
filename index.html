<div class="center-wrap"></div>

In the ad, a mission control center goes through a series of final checks before launching an iPhone 16 Pro into space like a rocket. During a 30-second countdown, the team ensures that all aspects of the A18 Pro chip are ready to go, such as the Neural Engine, 6-core GPU, and support for recording slow-mo 4K video at 120 fps.

            It's been two months since Apple released the Apple Watch Series 10, and <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera has been using the Series 10 alongside an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> to provide a longer term review and comparison.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The larger version of the Series 10 has the biggest display of any Apple Watch, including the Ultra 2, but it's only a little bit bigger than the Ultra 2 so you're not missing out on much if you have Apple's more rugged watch. The Series 10 is lighter and thinner, though, so it can be more comfortable.
<br/>
<br/>
In addition to having the largest display, the Series 10 has better visibility at an angle, so you can better see the time regardless of what you're doing. There's a 1Hz minimum refresh rate too so you get an always-on second hand with some watch faces.
