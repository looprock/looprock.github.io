<br/>
As a recap, Apple first allowed media to use the Vision Pro following its debut at the Worldwide Developers Conference, but it was still under development at the time and features were limited. Now the headset is nearing release, so testers are able to experience the Vision Pro as consumers will.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today received FCC approval for the upcoming Vision Pro headset, just days ahead of when pre-orders are set to go live for the device. FCC approval comes a little over two weeks before when the Vision Pro will be in the hands of consumers.
<br/>

<br/>
It is not unusual for new Apple devices to lack FCC approval until close to their launch date as it can take quite a bit of time for Apple to get products cleared. Apple devices undergo rigorous FCC testing in the United States prior to being able to be sold to the public.
<br/>
<br/>
For the last several months, Apple has been required to provide a warning message letting consumers know that the Vision Pro did not yet have FCC approval, but the wording will now be able to be removed from the website, advertising, and other places where it is printed.

We've been on a journey to strengthen our platform against abuse by continuously improving our account restriction systems. This helps us ensure that our policies are followed and that our community can keep growing. In a previous blog post, we talked about how we built our anti-abuse platform using CASAL. This powerful system is our first line of defense against bad actors and adversarial attacks. In this blog post, we'll go deeper into how we manage account restrictions. [&#8230;]<br>

            You'll soon be able to watch your favorite HBO shows on the Vision Pro, as streaming service Max will be available on Apple's mixed reality headset at launch. Formerly known as HBO Max, the service also offers content from CNN, the DC Universe, the Discovery Channel, the Food Network, HGTV, TBS, TLC, TNT, and more.

Apple last week confirmed that Max would be one of the entertainment options available on the Vision Pro, along with Apple TV+ and Disney+.
<br/>

"Apple Vision Pro features ultra-high-resolution displays that deliver more pixels than a 4K TV for each eye, enabling users to watch movies and TV shows from Apple TV+, Disney+, Max, and other services on a screen that feels 100 feet wide with support for HDR content,"  said Apple, in a &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/01/apple-vision-pro-availabl [...]<br>

            The Apple Vision Pro runs on an M2 chip equipped with ten GPU cores and eight CPU cores – the same version used in Apple's higher-end MacBook Air models. That's according to a <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1746585308626612655?s=20">post on X</a> (formerly Twitter) by <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman.

<br/>
Apple revealed early on that its mixed reality headset uses an M2 processor, but it wasn't clear until now which variant of the chip Apple had chosen. 
<br/>
<br/>
Apple uses the M2 chip in both of its current 13.6- and 15.3-inch MacBook Air models, which launched in June 2022. Built on 5-nanometer technology, the M2 has an 8-core CPU, much like the M1, but it supports eight or ten GPU cores, up from seven or eight in the M1.

The new policy, which the company said was in response to the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), allows users to opt out of data sharing across all, some, or none of a select number of Google’s services.
