            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple and Hermès today released an all-new knitted "Tricot" Apple Watch band, available in four color options.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-939425" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Hermès-Tricot-Single-Tour-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Apple describes the Tricot Single Tour as "a knitted textile band that comfortably hugs the wrist like a glove." It is available as a single tour band only.
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>Patterned on 1930s-era Hermès gloves created for driving, sailing, and golf, the Tricot band takes what was old and makes it new again. The continuous textile knit comfortably hugs the wrist, imparting both a freedom of movement and a sense of élan.</blockquote>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-03-04 06:32:19-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If you frequently work with external displays, it's worth noting that Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">just-announced</a> M3 MacBook Air models support two external displays – one more than the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the same M3 chip.

<br/>
Launched last October, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 chip simultaneously supports one external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz.

<br/>
In contrast, both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air with M3 chip support one external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz, and two external displays with up to 5K resolution at 60Hz when the laptop lid is closed, also known as clamshell mode.
