            Apple is going all out with promotions for the popular Severance <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+ show today, and as of right now, you'll find a new "Lumon Terminal Pro" <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/lumon-terminal-pro/">listed on Apple's Mac site</a>.

The Lumon Terminal Pro is designed to look similar to the machines that Severance employees like Mark S. and Helly R. use for macrodata refinement. The Terminal features a blue keyboard, a small display with wide bezels, and a trackball for navigation purposes.

            <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman today shared bad news for fans of the iPhone mini.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996767" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Purple-iPhone-12-Mini.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
In a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/sessions/2025-03-14/apple-s-2025-plans-and-strategy-live-q-a">live-streamed Q&amp;A session</a> today, Gurman said that Apple currently has no plans to reintroduce a smaller iPhone model.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple discontinued the iPhone 13 mini <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-iphone-13-mini/">in September 2023</a>, and it has not offered a mini model since then. Apple is not expected to release an iPhone 17 mini this year, and Gurman's revelation likely rules out an iPhone 18 mini next year too, given Apple's multi-year planning and development cycle for future iPhone models.

            Lots of lies are told about immigrants to stoke the always-smoldering fires of bigotry in this country. Trump and his fellow Republicans have told most of them. They claim immigrants commit more crimes than legal residents, something that has never been true. They claim immigrants are lazy, something anyone who&#8217;s ever worked with any immigrants [&#8230;]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today shared a new "Behind the Mac" video that's focused on hit <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+ show Severance, demonstrating how Macs were used for editing the series.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The 11-minute video is accompanied by <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/how-the-mind-splitting-world-of-severance-comes-together-on-mac/">an in-depth article</a> with additional details, but be warned, there are season two spoilers in both the video and the article.
<br/>
<br/>
According to Severance editor Geoffrey Richman, the final episode of the series was one of the most difficult to edit. One scene had 70 angles and takes to choose from, so he used a single multicam clip to play nine angles simultaneously to choose the most ideal shots. There was around 83TB of footage to comb through.

Richman primarily uses an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, and because he works remotely, he connects [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In the United States, the Apple Card offers a high-yield savings account option, allowing you to earn far more interest on your money compared to the average bank's basic savings account. However, the account's interest rate was lowered this week, with the annual percentage yield (APY) dropping from 3.9% to 3.75%.

<br/>
If you deposited $1,000 into the account, and maintained that balance for one year, you would earn $37.50 in interest based on the current APY.

The announcement indicates that the iPhone 16 series has passed the Indonesian telecommunications equipment certification – the final hurdle in the approvals process.

Last September, one report claimed that Apple allegedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/06/iphone-16-pro-4k-at-120fps-video-rumor/">tested 8K video recording</a> on the iPhone 16 Pro models.
