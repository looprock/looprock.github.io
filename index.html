On <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/?useASL=true">the Events website</a>, Apple has added an option to add the event to your calendar, and on YouTube, there is an option to get a reminder when the event begins.

Apple has never held a worldwide event at night before, so this is a first for the company.

Passkeys are a more secure alternative to passwords because a passkey cannot be shared with another person through a phishing attempt or leaked online through a database hack. Passkeys do not require customers to remember a password or add a two-factor authentication code, but they do require a verified device.

            Apple is expected to spend several billion on hardware to support its artificial intelligence development in 2024, according to speculation from <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/how-much-does-apple-need-to-invest-annually-in-generative-ai-to-catch-up-with-the-competition-56e237ea3feb">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.

Apple could purchase between 2,000 and 3,000 servers this year, and up to 20,000 next year. Kuo thinks that Apple is purchasing servers equipped with Nvidia's HGX H100 8-GPU for generative AI training, with the company planning to upgrade to B100 next year. Nvidia calls its H100 an AI supercomputing platform, and each one is priced at around $250,000.
