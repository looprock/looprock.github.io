Introduced in the United States in 2022, as part of iOS 16.1, the optional Clean Energy Charging feature enables iPhone users to charge their devices at times of the day when the electric grid is relatively cleaner. Apple says the feature can reduce your carbon footprint by selectively charging when lower carbon-emission electricity is available.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iOS 18.4, Apple added support for robot vacuums to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a>. There are a few Matter-enabled robot vacuums that can be added to the Home app for use with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, including the Deebot X8 Pro Omni from Ecovacs. I've been testing the X8 Pro Omni for the last several weeks to see if it's worth upgrading to a robot vacuum with Matter support to integrate with ‌Siri‌ and ‌HomeKit‌, as well as to check out its cleaning capabilities.

<br/>
The X8 Pro Omni is a circular vacuum that can both vacuum and mop, so it is an all-in-one floor cleaning bot. It comes with a base that has a dust bag, section for cleaning fluid, a tank for clean water, and a tank for dirty water.

            Apple today shared new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> ads, promoting features like the nano-texture display option and the long battery life.

Any of Apple's latest ‌MacBook Pro‌ models can be purchased with a nano-texture display option that's designed to cut down on glare when in sunlight and bright indoor lighting. For the anti-glare effect, Apple etches the glass at the nanometer level, and the etching scatters light to remove glare. Adding nano-texture is a $150 upgrade.

Apple's second ad features a man who lost his ‌MacBook Pro‌ charger, but he's unaware of that fact because his battery lasts so long. ‌MacBook Pro‌ models with the standard M4 chip can last fo [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When using macOS Finder in List view, you'll see the sizes of individual files – but not folders.
<br/>
Instead, folders show a pair of dashes (--) in the Size column. macOS skips calculating folder sizes by default to keep List view performance fast, especially in directories with many nested files. But if you want to keep an eye on folder sizes in certain locations, or even globally, there are a few ways to do it. Here's how.

<br/>
The update was shared ahead of Earth Day as part of the company's <a href="https://www.apple.com/environment/">2025 Environmental Progress Report</a>. The 60% milestone includes emissions from corporate operations, manufacturing, and the full product life cycle. The company aims to cut its emissions by 75% overall by 2030, with the remaining 25% to be offset through what it describes as "high-quality carbon credits."

            Apple today launched an <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/trade-in#recycle">Earth Day promotion</a> that offers customers 10% off eligible Apple accessories when they recycle eligible devices at participating Apple Stores. The offer is available from today through May 16 in many countries, including the U.S., Canada, U.K., Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, China, Japan, and others.

<br/>
Keep in mind that this promotion seems to be geared towards devices that are not eligible for trade-in credit at Apple Stores. The idea is that you can help the planet by bringing in old electronics to Apple for free recycling, as has long been possible, but now with the added bonus of receiving 10% off an accessory for a limited time.

The offer is available at physical Apple Store locations only. Each customer may recycle  [...]<br>

            Apple has seemingly changed the marketing strategy for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup and other products amid the delay in releasing key <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features.

<br/>
The global marketing campaign for the ‌iPhone 16‌ and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> centered around the tagline "Hello, ‌Apple Intelligence‌." The company now seems to have universally changed this to "Built for ‌Apple Intelligence‌," often in a smaller font. The alteration seems to be a subtle acknowledgment that ‌Apple Intelligence‌ isn't ready, moving emphasis from ‌Apple Intelligence‌ in the present to support in the future.
