            Apple today shared a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07cKD8GK__c">iPhone 15 Plus ad</a> on its YouTube channel that highlights the device's long-lasting battery life.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
In the video, an electrical outlet becomes sentient and sings the song "Way Too Long" by rapper Doe Boy. The outlet is sad that the iPhone 15 Plus lasts so long between charges, resulting in the device being plugged in less often.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple's tech specs say the iPhone 15 Plus can provide up to 26 hours of offline video playback, and up to 100 hours of audio playback. Like the iPhone 14 Plus, the iPhone 15 Plus offers the longest advertised battery life of any iPhone ever.

            <p>We throw around the term “waste” a lot in software. It’s been around since the 2000s, at least since the Poppendieck’s book <em>Lean Software Development</em>. DevOps really took it and ran with it, it was renamed “toil” in SRE, and now the concept is pretty solidly part of how we think of software. I<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaHnNw_aWQk"> talked with Steve Pereira on what “waste” means</a> exactly. We talked about value stream maps as well, another concept that’s so common that we don’t define it much anymore.

            The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are intensifying their investigations into Apple's alleged anti-competitive practices following the recent blocking of the iMessage for Android app Beeper Mini, the <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/22/technology/apple-iphone-beeper-mini.html">New York Times</a></em> reports.

<br/>
Following calls from a bipartisan group of senators for a DOJ investigation into the matter, Beeper founder Eric Migicovsky reportedly met with DOJ antitrust lawyers on Tuesday, December 12. The DOJ is currently embroiled in a four-year-long investigation into Apple's alleged anticompetitive conduct.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-12-21 11:51:19-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When the Apple Watch import ban goes into effect after December 25, 2023, Apple will not be able to repair out-of-warranty Apple Watch models in the United States.
