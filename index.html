            <b>Published:</b> 2024-05-08 08:35:20-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            TikTok parent company ByteDance <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/court-filing-on-tiktok-ban-2024">today filed a lawsuit</a> against the U.S. government in an effort to put a stop to the bill requiring <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/tiktok-facing-us-ban-congress-passes-bill/">TikTok to be sold off</a> to a non-Chinese company in a matter of months, or face a U.S. ban.

<br/>
The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act that passed in April requires ByteDance to divest its TikTok ownership within nine months, with the possibility of a three-month extension if a deal is in progress. If TikTok is not sold off, the bill will prevent app stores and companies in the U.S. from providing the TikTok app to users. As of now, TikTok will be forced to shut down on January 19, 2025.

            Paul Orlando is back to talk about his book titled “Why Now?” You may remember Paul from his last appearance (a fan favorite) talking with Jerod about complex systems & second-order effects. Paul’s book, “Why Now?” explores the concept of timing and the importance of understanding the ‘why now’ in business and product development. We discuss timing examples from the book that were either too early or too late (such as the first video phone and car phones), the need to consider both technological advancements and user demand when assessing timing, the significance of timing in the success of companies like Apple and the launch of the iPhone, Uber and Heroku, and more. Also, join our Slack community for a chance to get a signed copy of Paul’s book.<br>

            I think it best to start this post off with an admission: I had no idea that &#8220;broccolini&#8221; was not the name of an actual vegetable, but rather a trademarked brand name. I can&#8217;t see your faces, obviously, but I imagine some sizable percentage of them also have a look of mild surprise on them. [&#8230;]<br>

            <p>Business models are fascinating. Most business models come down to a type of arbitrage, at least as I understand it. You find something you have that you can sell to someone else, crucially, at a price above what it cost you to make that thing.<a class="footnote-anchor" href="https://cote.io/feed.xml#footnote-1" id="footnote-anchor-1" target="_self">1</a> In, let’s call it, The Capatalist Upbrining, there is a major intellectual jump where you understand that the price for a think is not determined by what it cost to make it, the costs of goods sold. No, no - not at all. How much it cost to make a thing has little to do with what price the thing sells for. And there’s the arbitrage: a business model is all about making the difference between the cost of goods sold and the price paid for goods as big, large, and mysterious as possible. Buy low, sell high.</p><p>It is because I am so familiar with the business of software that I think of it as The Beautiful Game of business. There is only one product more ep</p> [...]<br>
