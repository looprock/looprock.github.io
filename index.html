            <b>Published:</b> 2025-11-20 07:01:29-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple Watch owners have been voicing their frustration online over changes to the Workout app that Apple introduced in watchOS 26, with many finding the redesigned interface makes starting exercises difficult and exasperating.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005235" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/watchos-26-workout-app.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
When Apple launched watchOS 26 in September, the Workout app went from large, easily tapped workout tiles to a scrolling, corner-button interface. Instead of tapping a workout once to begin, users now select the workout type, and then tap a smaller play button that appears after a brief animation. Apple has also integrated music and podcast setup directly into the Workout app itself, so users can configure audio to automatically begin playing when they start exercising.
<br/>
<br/>
However, many of the changes appear to have become a major source of frustration over the last couple of months, b [...]<br>

Part of the change to the GDPR includes a modernization of cookie rules that should result in fewer pop-up cookie agreements on websites. The EC says that users will be able to indicate their cookie consent with a single click, with those preferences saved through the central settings of preferences in browsers and operating systems.

It sounds like browser makers will need to have a GDPR toggle that informs websites of a user's preference, eliminating the need for users to consent to cookies on a site-by-site basis.

<p>We have two ChatGPT subscriptions and a Claude subscription, so that&rsquo;s $60/month you put into that.</p>
<p>If I cut my Apple One subscription, you get $40/month. This would mostly mean moving all my photos to Google Photos instead of Apple Photos and using Google Drive instead of iCloud. I guess I&rsquo;d miss out on Apple TV+.</p>
<p>Of course, if Gemini and Siri are the same, that might make Apple One OK. But, I&rsquo;m sure Apple will give an angelic, but weird interface.</p><br>
