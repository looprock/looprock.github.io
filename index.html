            Microsoft today shared a new ad on YouTube with the tagline "we're faster than a Mac."

<br/>
In the video, Microsoft says the top-end Windows PCs with Copilot+ branding are up to 58% faster than the previous-generation MacBook Air with the M3 chip, based on Cinebench 2024 multi-core CPU benchmark results. The ad is citing old figures that were reported on all the way back <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/20/microsoft-surface-pro-faster-macbook-air/">in May 2024</a>, so take that as you will.
<br/>

While the ad is using an older MacBook Air for comparison purposes, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/windows/copilotplus-claims?tabs=amd">Microsoft's fine print</a> does say some Copilot+ PCs are still faster than even the latest MacBook Air models with the M4 chip, based on the same Cinebench 20 [...]<br>

            Apple this week introduced a new feature designed to allow prospective <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> users to import their saved music and playlists from third-party music services to ‌Apple Music‌.

It turns out that it may have been a bad idea dropping the well-recognized HBO brand name from the Max streaming service and opting for a much more generic name. In a blog post explaining the decision, WBD says that the HBO brand is best known for its consistent, high-quality content, which is what the company wants to focus on.
