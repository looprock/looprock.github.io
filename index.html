            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's autocorrect on iPhone and iPad always aims to help when you're typing a message, but it's by no means perfect, and some of the replacements it continually spews out can be frustrating. Fortunately, Apple's software includes a feature called Text Replacement that allows you to specify what word or phrase replaces the specific text you type in. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="On my way" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036299" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/on-my-way-text-replacement.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
Even if you haven't set up Text Replacement, you can try it out with Apple's pre-set example: In any app that accepts text input, type "Omw" followed by a space, and it will change to "On my way!" automatically.
<br/>
<br/>
The following steps guide you through the process of setting up your own handy shortcut phrases with text replacements on both iOS devices and Mac.
