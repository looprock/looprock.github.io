            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-04 15:43:46-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            We have just a few more days to go until Apple's September 9 "Awe Dropping" event that will see the introduction of the Apple Watch Series 11. No design changes are expected this year, but there could be some internal updates.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-972560" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/apple-watch-series-10-blue.jpeg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
<h2 id="updated_modem">Updated Modem</h2>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Series 11 is rumored to be getting a MediaTek modem that supports 5G RedCap, a 5G service designed for wearables that don't need standard 5G speeds. 5G RedCap should still bring speed improvements over the LTE that's in the current Series 10.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="new_chip">New Chip</h2>
<br/>
Apple has a new S11 chip in store for the Series 11, but it will have the same processor as the Series 10. We're not expecting speed improvements, but the chip could be smaller, providing more space for other internal components.
