            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Saudia, the flag carrier airline of Saudi Arabia, now supports Apple's iPhone feature that makes it easier to share the location of AirTag-equipped baggage at airports, according to <a href="https://www.arabianbusiness.com/industries/travel-hospitality/saudia-enhances-baggage-recovery-with-new-feature-for-apple-users">local media</a>.

<br/>
With iOS 18.2, Apple introduced a new Find My feature that lets you temporarily share the location of an AirTag-equipped item – such as a bag – with others, including participating airline staff, to help track it if it's lost or delayed.
<br/>
<br/>
Users running iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, or macOS Sequoia 15.2 and later can generate a "Share Item Location" link in the Find My app. Recipients can view the item's location on a live-updating web map.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is expected to implement a $50 price increase across its iPhone 17 lineup when the new models launch in September as a way to offset rising component costs and China tariffs, according to a new <a href="https://x.com/DeItaone/status/1950502871545356352">investor note</a> by Jefferies analyst Edison Lee.

<br/>
The price hike is expected across all iPhone 17 models, including the regular iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air (replacing the Plus model), iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max. Current iPhone models range from the base iPhone 16 starting at $799 to the iPhone 16 Pro Max at $1,199.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's official Support account on China's Weibo had a serious case of mistaken identity on Tuesday after it accidentally posted a slick promotional trailer for Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip7.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012372" height="864" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/samsung-galaxy-flip-7.jpeg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
In the embarrassing mix-up, the uploaded video clearly promoted Samsung's latest flip-style clamshell device rather than any Apple-affiliated product. Video capturing the blunder circulated across social media before the post was quickly deleted.
<br/>
<br/>
As for who is responsible for the error, the going theory is that it is an outsourced agency that handles marketing assets for both Apple and Samsung in the region. In other words, someone probably grabbed the wrong video file and hit publish without double-checking the content.

Apart from being humorous, the timing is notable given Samsung's strong position in the [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is running a Summer Deal of the Day promotion in its Apple TV app, offering discounts on movie bundles through the Apple TV Store. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012347" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/apple-summer-deal-of-the-day.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
Today is the first day of the promotion, and Apple is selling The Hangover trilogy for $9.99. The movies are normally priced between $12.99 and $14.99 each.
<br/>
<br/>
The initial Deal of the Day is number 1 of 14, so Apple will presumably be offering a different discounted bundle every day for the next two weeks. The Summer Deal of the Day packages can be purchased from the Store section of the Apple TV app on any platform where the app is available.
<br/>

Apple regularly offers discounted movie purchases and bundled deals that are more affordable than buying movies individually, but specific themed promotions are atypical.  <div class="linkback">Relate</div> [...]<br>
