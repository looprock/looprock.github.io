<br/>
According to a post by Weibo user "Phone Chip Expert," the 2nm process won't go into mass production until the end of 2025. The account holder, who claims to have 25 years of experience in the integrated circuit industry, including work on Intel's Pentium processors, suggests the iPhone 17 will therefore still use TSMC's 3nm process.

<br/>
"The 2nm process won't be mass-produced until the end of 2025, so the iPhone 17 definitely can't catch up," read a machine translation of Phone Chip Expert's <a href="https://weibo.com/1833340431/OnJ3ojmDk">post</a>. "It won't be until the iPhone 18 that a 2nm processor will be used."
