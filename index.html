There have been no changes to the design and opening process this year, and Apple is continuing to use the same chassis as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> model that was introduced in 2022.

The ‌MacBook Air‌'s battery is held in place with traditional adhesive strips that need to be carefully removed.

            If you've been following iPhone rumors over the last few years, you may remember reading reports that Apple flirted with the idea of introducing a super high-end "Ultra" model that would either <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/25/iphone-15-ultra-replacing-pro-max-model/">replace</a> its Pro Max device or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/05/gurman-new-top-of-the-line-iphone/">sit above it</a> in Apple's smartphone hirearchy. These reports appeared in the pre-launch iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 rumor cycles, but ultimately came to nothing. Now though, the rumor is back.

<br/>
In the film, Brad Pitt stars as an F1 driver who was an up-and-coming talent in the 1990s, until an accident on the track nearly ended his career. Thirty years later, Pitt is invited to join a former teammate's struggling F1 team, in a last-shot bid to save the team and become the best in the world. It looks to be a classic underdog story.

The film is directed by Joseph Kosinski, who is known for other popular action films, including "Tron: Legacy" and "Top Gun: Maverick."

AI companies cannot freely innovate while having to comply with "overly burdensome state laws," according to OpenAI. The company claims that laws regulating AI are "easier to enforce" with domestic companies, imposing compliance requirements that "weaken the quality and level of training data available to American entrepreneurs." OpenAI suggests that the government provide "private sector relief" from 781+ AI-related bills introduced in various states.
