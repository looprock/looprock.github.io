            iOS 17.4 introduces a small but useful change for the Clock app's Stopwatch function, adding the timer to Apple's Live Activities feature.

            Samsung came out with its 2024 flagship smartphone lineup in January, with the new devices competing directly with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max. Samsung's high-end S24 Ultra adopts some Apple-like features like a titanium chassis and a 5X zoom lens, but it also has standout additions that set it apart. We have an S24 Ultra, and thought we'd see how one main feature compares to the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max -- the camera.

It's unclear how widespread this issue is, but it seems to be very inconsistent, with recent reviews showing for some users and not for others depending on the app. We were able to reproduce the issue on iPhones in the U.S. and Canada, but not on an iPhone the U.K., while the Mac App Store does not appear to be affected whatsoever.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-01-29 03:21:59-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple-owned Shazam has released an updated version of the app with a new feature that can identify songs from other apps while you're listening using headphones.  
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-857861" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/08/shazam-for-mac.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
Shazam has been able to recognize songs from other apps for some time, but if headphones were connected to your iPhone, the feature wouldn't work, until now. The latest version of the app, v17.3, fixes that limitation.
<br/>
<br/>
The feature works when wired or bluetooth headphones are connected, and they don't have to be Apple-made accessories, so third-party headphones are also supported.
<br/>
<br/>
To use the feature, open the Shazam app, check for the headphone icon to confirm your headphones are connected, and then you'll be able to start recognizing music around you or within apps like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube.

            The Browser Company has released a new iPhone app called <a href="https://arc.net/blog/arc-search">Arc Search</a> that aims to reimagine the online search experience by using artificial experience to present web results in a more easily digestible, curated presentation.

<br/>
The app follows the company's <a href="https://arc.net">Arc Browser</a> for Mac, and could be described as an AI chat bot with web access (think <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai">perplexity.ai</a>), wrapped in a clean, minimalist browser interface that quickly builds webpages on the fly based on your search query.
<br/>
<br/>
The app opens with a search bar and keyboard, and its main AI-powered feature, "Browse for me," reads at least six websites and returns key information about the search query in a neatly presented webpage.

The ad demonstrates wearing the Vision Pro and navigating the visionOS operating system.

"Apple Vision Pro is here," the video description says. "Now, digital content blends seamlessly with your physical space. You can do the things you love in ways never before possible."

            Our old friend José Valim & his team have been hard at work adding gradual typing to Elixir. They’re only 1-3% of the way there, but a lot of progress has been made. So, we invited him back on the show for a deep-dive on why, how & when Elixir will be gradually typed.<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-01-27 06:53:39-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Following the Apple Card savings account's recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/apple-savings-account-apy-increase/">rate increase to 4.5%</a>, we have updated our guide comparing the annual percentage yields (APYs) of some popular high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs) available to U.S. residents.

<br/>
Apple's rate now exceeds that of popular HYSAs offered by the likes of American Express, Capital One, and Discover, but there are a handful of other options that offer even higher APYs in the 4.6% to low 5% range, such as Synchrony Bank and Wealthfront. Balance limits and other requirements vary by provider.
<br/>
<br/>
There are many other HYSAs not listed in our chart, so be sure to do your research before deciding which option is best suited for you.
