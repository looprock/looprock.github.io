<strong>*Note:</strong> a SWOT analysis is an evaluation of the fundamental, operational, technical, social, economic, and even, to some degree, administrative elements of a project. This is not a model to be used for trading purposes. (NFA, DYOR)</p>

Composed of four elements, Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats, a SWOT analysis framework provides excellent insight for establishing a high-level understanding of the state of a project's well-being through the lens of a birds-eye view.</p>

It can help formulate decisions around which areas require more attention, set performance goals, and organize a foundational understanding of where a project is headed.</p>

<br/>
The discussion comes ahead of the publication of the first list of services to be regulated by the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The legislation introduces new rules that apply to tech giants that meet its "gatekeeper" criteria and force them to open up their various services and platforms to other companies and developers. For example, Apple could be forced to allow third-party companies and rival apps like Meta's WhatsApp to integrate directly with iMessage.

In recent correspondence with the European Commission, Apple argued that iMessage does not meet the number of users at which the DMA's rul [...]<br>
