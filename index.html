            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-10 08:23:38-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Apple offered a line of Wi-Fi routers that it referred to as AirPort base stations. There was a standard AirPort Express, a higher-end AirPort Extreme with more advanced networking features, and an AirPort Time Capsule that doubled as an external storage drive for backing up a Mac with Time Machine.

Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/04/26/apple-officially-discontinues-airport-wireless-router-lineup/">discontinued the AirPort line</a> in 2018, and this week it shared more sad news that will impact the AirPort Time Capsule specifically.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Following its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/wwdc-2025-live-coverage/">WWDC keynote</a> on Monday, Apple updated a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/about-the-rosetta-translation-environment">developer document</a> to indicate that Rosetta 2 will remain available through macOS 27.

<br/>
Rosetta 2 enables Macs with Apple silicon (Arm architecture) to run apps that were built for Macs with an Intel processor (x86 architecture), by translating code.
<br/>
<br/>
Starting with macOS 28, Apple said that only a limited version of Rosetta 2 will remain available for older games that rely on Intel-based frameworks:<blockquote>Rosetta was designed to make the transition to Apple silicon easier, and we plan to make it available for the next two major macOS releases – through macOS 27 – as </blockquote> [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-10 07:38:25-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has released the first iOS 26 beta to developers, but even non-developers have the opportunity to download beta software updates on their iPhones for free. Keep reading to learn how it's done.
<br/>

<br/>
Traditionally, when Apple announced a major new operating system update, the first wave of betas would only be available to download by paying subscribers to <a href="https://developer.apple.com">Apple's Developer Program</a>, which costs $99 a year. Public betas would then become available to users enrolled in <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/welcome">Apple's Public Beta Software Program</a> after a delay of a few days or weeks after the developer beta has been released. That all changed in 2023, and these days iPhone users no longer have to wait for a publicly released beta to test what's new.

            This weekend, Donald Trump pulled off something that&#8217;s happened exactly once before in US history: federalizing a state&#8217;s National Guard over the state governor&#8217;s objections without invoking the Insurrection Act. And he did it to deal with what the LAPD itself described as peaceful protests that were &#8220;under control.&#8221; The constitutional implications here are important. [&#8230;]<br>

With the Notes app on the Apple Watch, you can finally view your notes right on your wrist. You can also create new notes with Siri, or by using the on-screen keyboard, and they will sync to your iPhone, iPad, and Mac via iCloud.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-10 04:43:32-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26 beta 1, Apple has seemingly tweaked the swipe-to-go-back gesture to make it easier to navigate screens on bigger iPhones.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005254" height="3078" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/swipe-to-go-back-gesture-ios-26.jpg" width="5472"/>
<br/>
In iOS 18, many apps allow you to navigate back to the previous screen by swiping with your thumb from the left edge of the display. This is generally easier than tapping a back button in the top-left corner, especially if you're navigating with one hand. 
<br/>
<br/>
However, to trigger the gesture, you need to start swiping from the very edge of the screen, which is harder if you have small hands or you're using a larger device like an iPhone 16 Pro Max.
<br/>
<br/>
To make things easier in iOS 26, you no longer have to start the rightward swipe at the very edge of the screen. Now you can start the gesture from anywhere, like the middle of the display. Providing you're not  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's first iOS 26 beta includes a new "Keep Audio in Headphones" setting that addresses a common frustration for iPhone users juggling multiple audio devices.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005246" height="3078" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/keep-audio-headphones-ios-26.jpg" width="5472"/>
<br/>
Found in Settings ➝ General ➝ AirPlay &amp; Continuity, the new toggle prevents audio from automatically switching to newly connected devices like car speakers or Bluetooth speakers when you're already listening through headphones or AirPods. Instead of having your music suddenly blast through your car's sound system, audio continues playing through your original output device.

This seemingly simple addition solves an awkward scenario many users will have experienced. Say you're listening to a podcast through AirPods while walking to your car, only to have it unexpectedly resume through CarPlay when you start the engine. Now you can stop that h [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In watchOS 26, the Apple Watch Workout app has received its biggest interface overhaul since it launched, introducing a redesigned layout that promises easier access to key features.

Four new corner buttons now provide quick access to popular workout customization tools including Workout Views, Custom Workout, Pacer, and Race Route.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple in watchOS 26 has added a new one-handed wrist-flick gesture to easily dismiss notifications, but the gesture only works on newer Apple Watch models.

<br/>
When you raise your wrist to check a notification but aren’t ready to respond, you can now simply flick your wrist – turn it over and back – to dismiss it. The quick gesture lets you dismiss notifications and incoming calls, silence timers and alarms, and return to the watch face. 
<br/>
<br/>
It works by using the accelerometer and gyroscope in your watch, along with a machine learning model that analyzes your wrist movement. However, the functionality is limited to Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch 10, and Apple Watch Ultra 2.

            This article was originally published in 2018, yet its core insights into Go’s garbage collection model remain highly relevant for developers today. While some implementation details of Go’s runtime have evolved, the foundational concepts explored here—such as the semantics of the tri-color mark and sweep algorithm, Stop The World (STW) events, and GC trace interpretation—are still essential to understanding how Go manages memory. Whether you&rsquo;re optimizing performance or deepening your knowledge of Go internals, this post continues to offer a clear and practical guide to working with the garbage collector, not against it.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            macOS Tahoe does away with the Launchpad feature that's designed to show you all of the apps on your Mac, instead replacing it with a new "Applications" interface that's similar to the App Library on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.

<br/>
The Applications interface organizes apps by category, like Utilities, Productivity and Finance, Social, Creativity, Information and Reading, Entertainment, and Other. There's also a Suggested section at the top of the interface.

The Launchpad replacement appears to be part of Apple's big Spotlight overhaul, and it can also be used to access Actions, Files, and Clipboard, with quick access keyboard shortcuts. Apple calls these "Browse Modes."
