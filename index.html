            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18, currently in beta, Apple is allowing iPhone users to replace the flashlight and camera buttons on the Lock Screen with something more useful, or to make them disappear entirely.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954622" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-lock-screen-buttons.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
The dedicated flashlight and camera shortcuts you see at the bottom of your iPhone's Lock Screen were introduced in their current form with the release of iOS 11 alongside the iPhone X in 2018, and the two icons have since been a staple, non-customizable feature.
<br/>
<br/>
But that's all set to change this September with the launch of iOS 18. The Lock Screen buttons on your iPhone can now be replaced with any Control Center option. This includes system features like Dark Mode, Airplane Mode, Accessibility options, Calculator, and Translate, as well as Shortcuts – making the functional possibilities endless.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-08-16 12:45:45-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the launch of iOS 18.1 this fall, Apple will allow third-party developers to support NFC contactless transactions for payments and more. Right now, the NFC chip is locked down, and it's primarily only used for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>, but a number of new capabilities will be coming when Apple expands access to NFC.
