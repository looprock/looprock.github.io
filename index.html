            Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> have now been available for almost five years, so what do we know about the second-generation version?

<br/>
According to Apple supply chain analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, the new ‌AirPods Max‌ <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/19/kuo-lighter-version-airpods-max-2027/">will be lighter</a> than the current ones, but exactly how much is as yet known. The current ‌AirPods Max‌ weigh 0.85 pounds (386.2 grams), excluding the charging case, making it one of the heavier options in the premium over-ear headphones category. It is unclear what other changes they might have, beyond weighing less.

            Apple plans to announce new products "this week," according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919458" height="902" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/space-black-mbp.jpg" width="1600"/>

In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-10-12/inside-apple-s-glasses-pivot-when-apple-is-launching-m5-macbook-pro-ipad-pro"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a>, Gurman said the products set to be updated this week include the iPad Pro, Vision Pro, and "likely" the base 14-inch MacBook Pro, with all three likely to receive a spec bump with Apple's next-generation M5 chip.
<br/>
<br/>
Gurman does not expect Apple to hold an event to announce these products. Instead, there will likely be a series of press releases on the Apple Newsroom website, and there might also be shorter promotional videos for each product on YouTube.

Our marketplace is home to more than 100 million special items made, handpicked and designed by more than 5 million sellers. These items and the real people behind them are what set us apart.

<p>With millions of creative items across thousands of categories – many of which are unique – it’s difficult to accurately capture all possible product attributes, which range from standard attributes like “color” and “material”, to niche attributes like “bead hole size” and “slime additives.” The range of possible attributes and their values is so broad that it’s a challenge even to enumerate them, let alone label listings with specific attribute data.

In a <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/mnbyfW1xgQZ5ia">new report</a>, Kuo said that the hinge designed for Apple's foldable ‌iPhone‌ is expected to carry an average selling price (ASP) of approximately $70 to $80 when mass production begins, well below the market expectation of $100 to $120 or higher.
