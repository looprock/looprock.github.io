            <b>Published:</b> 2025-04-09 10:49:27-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple stock is on the rise after U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to pause most tariffs for a 90-day period. Tariffs are immediately on hold in countries that have not enacted retaliatory tariffs, which means this pause does not apply to China, but it is applicable in other countries where Apple suppliers operate like India, Vietnam, and Taiwan.

While Trump has paused tariffs in most countries, he raised tariffs on incoming Chinese goods to 125 percent, up from 104 percent earlier today. The 125 percent tariff is effective immediately, and comes after China raised tariffs on U.S. goods to 84 percent this morning.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Postgres is a data storage tool, and as a tool it is neutral in how it is used.  Tools can be used for good, for harm, and because Postgres is open source, the community doesn't even
know how it is used.
</p>
<p>My first knowledge of non-traditional uses of Postgres was in 2003 during a Postgres <a class="txt2html" href="https://bignerdranch.com/" style="text-decoration: none;">training.</a>  During a break, someone whispered to me that one of the
attendees was from a pornographic video company, and that Postgres was very popular in that industry.  The more I thought about it, the more it made sense — many database companies
didn't want to do business with them, but Postgres was open source so they could use it easily.
</p>
<p>The flexibility of Postgres to be used without restrictions didn't become apparent to me again until 2014, when Russia invaded

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has lost its position as the world's most valuable public company to Microsoft following a dramatic four-day slide in its stock price, driven largely by concerns over President Donald Trump's escalating tariff war with China, where most of its iPhones are assembled.

<br/>
Apple's market capitalization fell to $2.59 trillion as of Tuesday's close, while Microsoft now sits at $2.64 trillion, reclaiming the top spot after briefly holding it earlier this year.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares have plummeted approximately 23% over just four trading sessions, shaving $700 billion off its value, as panicked investors dump stock due to the company's exposure to China for manufacturing and sales.

The deal runs until April 24, 2025, and offers a decent discount from the regular $9.99 monthly subscription price, saving viewers $21 over the promotional period.
<br/>
<br/>
The offer comes as Apple TV+ has been boosted in popularity with hit shows like "Severance," which recently surpassed "Ted Lasso" as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/severance-more-popular-than-ted-lasso/">platform's most-watched series</a>.

Apple, along with Dell, Microsoft, and Lenovo, reportedly scrambled to mitigate the impact of the tariffs by accelerating shipments before April 9, the day the tariffs came into effect.

<br/>
The iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are expected to debut a major redesign of the rear camera bump, replacing the traditional square module with a horizontal, rectangular bar that stretches across the back of the device. This new layout resembles the runway-style camera panel seen on Google Pixel phones.

Apple's iPhones have maintained the same front-facing design language for several years, and the rear is one of the few remaining areas for meaningful visual evolution. Based on CAD renders and leaked parts, the updated bump retains th [...]<br>
