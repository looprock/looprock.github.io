            <b>Published:</b> 2024-04-04 05:06:13-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models will feature thinner bezels thanks to Border Reduction Structure (BRS) technology, <a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=27023"><em>The Elec</em></a> reports.

<br/>
BRS technology allows for a more compact and efficient layout of the screen's underlying circuitry, enabling slimmer bezels without compromising on the display's performance or the device's overall form factor. This requires precise and advanced manufacturing techniques, given the complexity of tighter circuit placement and the need for bending some wiring downwards beneath the bezel.

Display Driver ICs (DDIs), the components at the center of this manufacturing challenge, control the activation and illumination of pixels on the [...]<br>

A 7.4-magnitude earthquake struck Taiwan in the early hours of the morning, killing at least nine people, injuring hundreds, and causing significant damage to infrastructure, including disrupting operations at several TSMC key manufacturing sites. Sources familiar with TSMC's operations said that the company's N3 fab in Tainan suffered structural damage, with beams and columns broken, leading to an outright halt in production. EUV machines, essential for manufacturing processes below 7nm, have stopped, and research and development labs have been su [...]<br>

            <p>You can generate really big Dungeons &amp; Dragons battle maps with Midjourney. It takes some iteration and tinkering, but the maps are great. I like big battle maps so that characters, NPCs, and monsters have lots of room to move around and take tactical advantage of ranged spells and attacks. While the big images are grainy when you zoom in, if you save the series of original images that you zoomed out of, you can always zoom back in, so to speak.</p>
