            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has joined a coalition of U.S. businesses in protest at India's sudden introduction of tech import restrictions last month, claiming the move will damage New Delhi's ambitions to become a global manufacturing hub and harm consumers (via <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-18/apple-intel-among-top-us-firms-to-decry-new-india-licensing-rules?srnd=technology-vp#xj4y7vzkg">Bloomberg</a></em>).

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-08-18 06:14:40+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            AI systems today exhibit biases along race, gender, and other factors that reflect societal prejudices and imbalanced training data.
Main causes are lack of diversity in data and teams, and focus on pure accuracy over fairness.
Mitigation tactics like adversarial debiasing, augmented data, and ethics reviews can help reduce bias.
Fundamentally unbiased AI requires rethinking how we build datasets, set objectives, and make ethical design central.
Future challenges include pursuing general AI safely while removing bias, and cross-disciplinary collaboration.
AI has potential as a rational foil to counteract irrational human biases and promote fairness, if developed responsibly.
Choices made now in how AI is created and applied will determine whether it reduces or amplifies discrimination in the long run.<br>

            Nomad today introduced its most powerful charger to date, the <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/ac-adapter-130w-usb-c">130W USB-C Power Adapter</a> that's equipped with three USB-C PD ports. The 130W adapter joins Nomad's existing 65W, 30W, and 20W adapters.

<br/>
Priced at $110, the 130W Power Adapter features the same design as Nomad's prior adapters, so if you have one of the smaller varieties, you can have a matching set. It's got a sleek black "carbide" enclosure, and it does use GaN (gallium nitride) technology to ensure a compact size.

I always find myself wishing Nomad made its accessories in white or other colors, but black is the Nomad aesthetic and it works. I can say without hesitation that this is the snazziest charging brick I've used, though I have to admit I don't often think too much about the  [...]<br>
