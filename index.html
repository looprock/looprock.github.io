            Apple's upcoming iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are rumored to feature thinner bezels around the display compared to the current models, but this change has reportedly led to a manufacturing issue ahead of the devices launching.

            5G is faster and more flexible than 4G, but it carries cybersecurity risks. These include increased attack surfaces, the security vulnerabilities of IoT, GPRS tunneling protocols, connection to legacy networks, increased bandwidth, network function virtualization, reliance on software, and IMSI encryption weaknesses.

            One thing was certain, that the white kitten had had nothing to do with it:—it was the black kitten’s fault entirely. For the white kitten had been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it couldn’t have had any hand in the mischief.

The way Dinah washed her children’s faces was this: first she held the poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw she rubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and just now, as I said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which was lying quite still and trying to purr—no doubt feeling that it was all meant for its good.<br>

            Begin with an individual, and before you know it you find that you have created a type; begin with a type, and you find that you have created—nothing. That is because we are all queer fish, queerer behind our faces and voices than we want any one to know or than we know ourselves. When I hear a man proclaiming himself an "average, honest, open fellow," I feel pretty sure that he has some definite and perhaps terrible abnormality which he has agreed to conceal—and his protestation of being average and honest and open is his way of reminding himself of his misprision.

There are no types, no plurals. There is a rich boy, and this is his and not his brothers' story. All my life I have lived among his brothers but this one has been my friend. Besides, if I wrote about his brothers I should have to begin by attacking all the lies that the poor have told about the rich and the rich have told about themselves—such a wild structure they have erected that when we pick up a book about the rich, some instinct prepares u [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Jim Powell was a Jelly-bean. Much as I desire to make him an appealing character, I feel that it would be unscrupulous to deceive you on that point. He was a bred-in-the-bone, dyed-in-the-wool, ninety-nine three-quarters per cent Jelly-bean and he grew lazily all during Jelly-bean season, which is every season, down in the land of the Jelly-beans well below the Mason-Dixon line.

Now if you call a Memphis man a Jelly-bean he will quite possibly pull a long sinewy rope from his hip pocket and hang you to a convenient telegraph-pole.

            In an effort to bolster user privacy, developers will need to justify their use of certain Apple APIs before their apps can be listed on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, according to a new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_use_of_required_reason_api">article on the Apple developer website</a> spotted by <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/07/27/app-store-describe-app-api/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a>.

            The crypto industry is poised for significant growth in the coming years, presenting a unique financial opportunity. To capitalize on this potential, it's crucial to perform due diligence (DYOR) on crypto projects. Qualitative evaluations involve assessing both the fundamentals and technical aspects of a project. Three rules for quality assessments include independent thinking, being aware of manipulated data, and finding the right balance between urgency and careful consideration. Key areas to explore include project websites, ranking sites, explorers, social media, content, and design. By thoroughly understanding projects, you can make well-informed investment decisions and potentially achieve substantial gains.<br>
