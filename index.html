Apple is reportedly urging the Indian government to modify provisions in the Income Tax Act of 1961 to ensure it is not taxed simply for owning high-value manufacturing machinery supplied to its contract manufacturers, including Foxconn and Tata Electronics.

The Korean-language report claims that only the ‌iPhone 18‌ Pro and ‌iPhone 18‌ Pro Max will feature the camera, which will replace the main wide-angle camera on the rear, sitting alongside the ultra-wide and telephoto cameras.

A variable aperture allows the camera to adjust the amount of light that reaches the sensor. This means that in dark environments, the aperture can be opened to receive more light, while in light environments, it can be closed to prevent over-exposure. It also should provide users with greater control over depth of field, which [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>For more than 20 years, Etsy has been the destination for human creativity online. Our marketplace is home to more than 100 million special items made, handpicked and designed by more than 5 million sellers. These items and the real people behind them are what set us apart. But while the huge variety of Etsy’s inventory is one of our greatest strengths, it also creates fundamental engineering challenges specific to our marketplace. </p>
<h2>The challenge: Etsy’s unique inventory</h2>
<p>With millions of creative items across thousands of categories – many of which are unique – it’s difficult to accurately capture all possible product attributes, which range from standard attributes like “color” and “material”, to niche attributes like “bead hole size” and “slime additives.” The range of possible attributes and their values is so broad that it’s a challenge even to enumerate them, let alone label listings with specific attribute data.
