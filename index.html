            There have been multiple signs suggesting that Apple's mixed reality Vision Pro headset is struggling to take off, both due to the super high price and the heavy design that limits the amount of time it can be worn for most people. What does the Vision Pro's floundering mean for Apple's work on future virtual and augmented reality projects?

<h2>Vision Pro Interest</h2>
<br/>
Interest in the Vision Pro was high in February when the device first launched because it was an all-new product category for Apple, but that didn't last. The Vision Pro is indisputably impressive, and it is mind blowing to watch a butterfly flit by so closely it feels like you can reach out and touch it, or to see the rough skin of an elephant as it walks right by you, but the magic quickly wears off for most.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18.1, there is a new option to set a "Primary" email address in the Settings app, which means it is easier to change the main email address associated with your Apple Account. The Primary email address is the one that is visible to other people when collaborating on and sharing documents, sending calendar invites, and more.

The goalie masks were created for Jeremy Swayman of the Boston Bruins, Jacob Markström of the New Jersey Devils, Stuart Skinner of the Edmonton Oilers, Sam Montembeault of the Montréal Canadiens, Linus Ullmark of the Ottawa Senators, Joseph Woll of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and Thatcher Demko of the Vancouver Canucks.
