<p>Embarking on the voyage of machine learning and data analysis, it's crucial to have a reliable map to navigate the data's intricate terrain. Enter Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the compass that guides us through the data wilderness, revealing its secrets, relationships, and patterns hidden beneath the surface. EDA is an essential step in the data science process that involves gaining a deeper understanding of the data and uncovering its underlying structure, relationships, and patterns. It's the process of summarising, visualizing, and transforming data to extract insights and inform decisions about the next steps in data analysis and modeling.</p>

In this article, we set sail on a captivating journey through the EDA process, using the legendary <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data">Titanic dataset from Kaggle</a> as our North Star 🌟.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple plans to use its own modem chip for iPhones starting in 2025, according to <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/qualcomm-is-the-main-loser-from-huaweis-adoption-of-kirin9000s-and-new-kirin-chips-e96080908f5c">information shared today</a> by supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. He previously said the fourth-generation iPhone SE would be Apple's first device with the custom-designed 5G modem, but it's not entirely clear if this is still the plan anymore.

In July, it was reported that mass-production of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/05/iphone-se-4-rumor-recap/">fourth-generation iPhone SE was delayed until 2025</a>, so there is still a chance that it could be the first device with Apple's modem, but there have been conflicting rumors about the project.

            <p>I dream of hiking from Munich to Venice and trekking across the beautiful Alps. But as I still have to live my everyday life, my journey has to consist of multiple stages, with weeks, months, or even years between each adventure.

I wanted a way to celebrate the progress I’ve made and to motivate myself to take the journey further.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>\
Passion is a strange concept.</p>
<p>\
Some people take it for granted, while others can't imagine spending hundreds of hours on a single activity.</p>
<p>\
What's certain is that the Internet, and social networks in particular, have given us the wrong idea about passion.</p>
<p>They have created an amalgam between passion and success.</p>
<p>\
They make us think that success has to be instantaneous and that if we fail, it's because our passion isn't strong enough.</p>
<p>And that's what keeps us from taking action.</p>
<p>\
I call this the passion paradox.</p>
<p>\
<strong>The Paradox of Passion</strong>: When faced with doubting whether we're passionate or not, we choose to remain inactive and thus can’t develop a passion.</p>
<p>\
The paradox of passion is completely illogical and based on our fear of failing.</p>
<p>What's more, this paradox triggers a vicious circle that amplifies inaction.</p>

The slightest difficulty makes us doubt.</p>

We convince ourselves that our passion isn't real, </p> [...]<br>

            The Rev. Septimus Harding was, a few years since, a beneficed clergyman residing in the cathedral town of ––––; let us call it Barchester. Were we to name Wells or Salisbury, Exeter, Hereford, or Gloucester, it might be presumed that something personal was intended; and as this tale will refer mainly to the cathedral dignitaries of the town in question, we are anxious that no personality may be suspected. Let us presume that Barchester is a quiet town in the West of England, more remarkable for the beauty of its cathedral and the antiquity of its monuments than for any commercial prosperity; that the west end of Barchester is the cathedral close, and that the aristocracy of Barchester are the bishop, dean, and canons, with their respective wives and daughters.

Early in life Mr Harding found himself located at Barchester. A fine voice and a taste for sacred music had decided the position in which he was to exercise his calling, and for many years he performed the easy but not highly paid duties of a minor can [...]<br>

<br/>
SellCell asked over 1,000 iPhone users and over 1,000 Android users in the United States to gather its data. Of existing iPhone users surveyed, 63% said that Apple moving to a USB-C charging port would influence their decision to upgrade to an iPhone 15. 
<br/>
<br/>
Of those that would be motivated to buy because of USB-C, the majority of iPhone users (37%) said they would upgrade because they would be able to use a single charging cable for iPhones, Macs, and iPads. Overall, 66% of iPhone users said that they will upgrade to an iPhone 15.

Gurman suggests that the overnight update could be because Apple is planning for near-immediate availability of new products after the event, but it could also be time that is used to put up new marketing materials.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Each year, Etsy hosts an event known as  “CodeMosaic” - an internal hackathon in which Etsy admin propose and build bold advances quickly in our technology across a number of different themes.  People across Etsy source ideas, organize into teams, and then have 2-3 days to build innovative proofs-of-concept that might deliver big wins for Etsy’s buyers and sellers, or improve internal engineering systems and workflows.</p>
<p>Besides being a ton of fun, CodeMosaic is a time for engineers to pilot novel ideas. Our team’s project this year was extremely ambitious - we wanted to build a system for stateful machine learning (ML) model training and online machine learning. While our ML pipelines are no stranger to streaming data, we currently don’t have any models that learn in an online context - that is, that can have their weights updated in near-real time.</p>
