            Apple will release its first MacBooks based on TSMC's 3nm fabrication process in 2024, not this year as some rumors have suggested. That's according to a new five-year global notebook shipments forecast published by <em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20231011VL209/digitimes-research-2023-notebook-shipments.html">DigiTimes</a></em>.

On a <a href="https://bloomberg.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_lWrE5XzyQkSCqFzJhqor1w#/registration">display-related webinar</a> with Bloomberg Intelligence's Woo Jin Ho, Young said it will take a few years for Apple's supply chain partners to build out manufacturing lines for mass production of laptop-sized OLED panels, so he does not expect MacBook Pro models with OLED displays to launch until 2026 or 2027.

Registered developers can download the tvOS 17.1 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.

tvOS updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on bug fixes and smaller improvements rather than notable outward-facing changes. tvOS 17.1 adds a new favoriting option to the Music app on the ‌Apple TV‌, along with some other minor Music changes.
