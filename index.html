            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple hasn't introduced a major update for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> since the headphones came out in 2020, but last year there was a minor refresh with new color options and an upgrade to USB-C charging. With no additional new features on the horizon, we thought we'd take a look at whether the ‌AirPods Max‌ are worth picking up in 2025.

<br/>
The transition to USB-C didn't upgrade any other internal hardware, so reviews from 2020 about Active Noise Cancellation and sound quality are still valid. The ‌AirPods Max‌ sound great even after five years, but nothing has improved in terms of the overarching listening experience, and with no design updates, the ‌AirPods Max‌ are still on the heavy side for ANC over-ear headphones, and some people find t [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-04-23 07:57:09-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If you're a Mac user with a Windows PC background, you'll probably know how to use the typical copy and paste commands in macOS. But there's a handy clipboard trick that's worth keeping in mind.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-999495" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/copy-paste-shortcut.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
In Windows, the Copy and Paste key combinations are <strong>Control-C</strong> and <strong>Control-V</strong>, respectively. On the Mac, it's very similar – all you do is use the <strong>Command (⌘)</strong> key instead of Control. 
<br/>
<br/>
But did you know that you can also paste text without its original formatting? Not knowing that this is possible on a Mac, many users paste text into a plain-format text editor to strip it of any styling before copying and pasting it again to its intended destination. But you don't have to do that.

            Netflix recreated an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> from the ground up for its newly released thriller "iHostage," a dramatization of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/22/apple-store-amsterdam-robbery/">real-life hostage crisis</a> that took place at Apple's Leidseplein retail store in Amsterdam in 2022.

Since filming inside an actual ‌Apple Store‌ was not possible, Netflix and the production team behind "iHostage" reconstructed a full-scale replica of the Amsterdam location.
