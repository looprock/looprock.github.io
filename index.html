Pixelmator recently added support to the app for vector PDFs, which allows users to import image, shape, and text elements in the portable document format as separate layers.

<br/>
With the newest version, this support has been expanded so that users can edit imported text as regular text layers. In practice, this means existing text in PDFs can be more easily replaced, formatted, and styled using Pixelmator Pro tools. As the developers explain:

In iOS 17.4, released last month, Apple no longer limits EU users to the handful of browser options that iOS currently offers as alternatives in other parts of the world. Instead, users in the EU who open Safari for the first time are presented with a choice screen that allows them to opt for a new default browser from a list of popular alternatives in their country.

Nanoleaf is known for unique light designs, and the Outdoor String Lights aren't an exception. The bulbs have an angular five-sided shape that makes them more geometric than soft. They're made from a hard, clear plastic material and they look like they're made from crystal or ice. If you want cozy, romantic-style lighting, Nanoleaf's lights might not be the right vibe because of the shape, but if you want lights that are fun and eye-catching, these are perfect.

            Apple will begin updating its Mac lineup with M4 chips in late 2024, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-11/apple-aapl-readies-m4-chip-mac-line-including-new-macbook-air-and-mac-pro"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. The M4 chip will be focused on improving performance for artificial intelligence capabilities.

<br/>
Last year, Apple introduced the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips all at once in October, so it's possible we could see the M4 lineup come during the same time frame. Gurman says that the entire Mac lineup is slated to get the M4 across late 2024 and early 2025.

Magic Editor, which featured heavily in last year's Google Pixel 8 series marketing blitz, uses generative AI to perform complicated photo edits, such as filling in gaps in a photo, repositioning subjects, and additional foreground/background adjustments like making a cloudy, grey sky look blue.

The edits mimic the kind of possibilities afforded by more professional editing tools like Photoshop, except Magic Editor achieves its automated results via AI, rather than the user having to do them manually.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>For about 7 months, I’ve been playing solo D&amp;D with ChatGPT. I prompt ChatGPT to be the “ChatDM.” It sort of works, and at least, it’s fun enough to keep doing it and working on making it better. Here’s my most recent overview of what works and doesn’t work, based on a longer play session this week:</p>
<p>In addition to the obvious prompting to play as a DM, there are a few things you have to be specific about. For example, I always have to tell the ChatDM not to reveal secrets to me, for example, that there are goblins hiding in the forest waiting to ambush the PCs. Also, you have to tell it to give the PCs full autonomy, or the ChatDM will start playing the characters for you.</p>
<p>This week, the ChatDM was pretty good at combat, but I had to give it some coaching here and there. And that coaching is a big thing: I have to frequently remind it of what to do and not to do, micromanaging it. There are a few other lessons learned in the video.</p>
