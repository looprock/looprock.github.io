In ‌iOS 26‌ beta 2, Apple refined several interface elements to slightly improve visual clarity and usability. The Control Center's Liquid Glass buttons now appear more clearly, thanks to increased background blur that makes them easier to distinguish. Similarly, the Reduce Transparency setting in Accessibility has been enhanced, further cutting down the see-through effect across the UI.

These days, Chris is working on Vibes.diy and Fireproof — tools that make one-shot app generation not only possible, but shareable within minutes. We talk about the origins of CouchDB, the fork that led to Membase and Couchbase, and how that long journey led to this new paradigm: Vibe Coding.<br>
