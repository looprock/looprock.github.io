<br/>
OpenAI has purportedly talked to suppliers about products that resemble a smart speaker without a display, as well as glasses, a digital voice recorder, and a wearable pin. The company is targeting late 2026 or early 2027 for the release of its first device. 
<br/>
<br/>
OpenAI has succeeded in luring Apple employees away with lucrative compensation packages, and promises of less bureaucracy and more collaboration. It has offered stock grants that can exceed $1 million.

<br/>
Instead of the familiar split between standard and Pro models, Apple this year introduced the new ‌iPhone Air‌ and expanded the feature gap between tiers. The result is a predicament between the affordable and practical ‌iPhone 17‌, and the super-thin and all-new ‌iPhone Air‌, with distinct trade-offs in size, materials, camera hardware, and battery life along the way. While they both share brighter displays, ProMotion, and an all-new 18-megapixel camera, their designs, display sizes, and camera features are more specialized than ever before.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, Apple has added a new feature to its Home screen customization options that can match the color of your app icons with the actual color of your iPhone. The image below demonstrates the effect on the new iPhone 17 Pro in Cosmic Orange.

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020253" height="3212" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/tinted-app-icons-match-iphone-17-cosmic-orange.jpg" width="5711"/>
<br/>
In iOS 18, Apple introduced Tinted app icons. The option applies a color filter over app icons, widgets, and even system UI elements, and with iOS 26, Apple has built on the theme with a new option that matches the color of your iPhone model. 
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26 knows the exact finish and color variant of your iPhone – Deep Blue, Sage, or Lavender, for example – because Apple has the device's SKU mapped at the firmware level (SKUs are a unique identifier that companies use to track and manage inventory). This allows iOS to identify your model and matc [...]<br>

            Meta this week unveiled $800 smart glasses that include an in-lens display. The new <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/meta-ray-ban-display-ai-glasses-connect-2025/">Meta Ray-Ban Display</a> AI glasses allow you to check messages, view photos, and interact with Meta AI without the need to use a smartphone.

<br/>
There is a full-color, high-resolution display included in the glasses, along with cameras, microphones, and speakers. Meta says that the included monocular display has a custom light engine and custom module that provides sharp contrast and high brightness. There are 42 pixels in each degree of the field of view.
<br/>
<br/>
Meta placed the display off to the side to prevent it from obstructing the view through the glasses, and the display is also not designed to be on constantly. It is meant for short interactions.

<br/>
The battery inside the accessory has an unusual shape, leading iFixit to conclude that it's possible that Apple is using the same battery for the ‌iPhone Air‌ and the ‌iPhone Air‌ ‌MagSafe‌ Battery.

<br/>
iFixit compared the battery in the ‌MagSafe‌ Battery pack to the ‌iPhone Air‌ battery that Apple showed off when introducing the new device, and it does appear to be a close match if not identical.

The battery has a 12.26Wh capacity, and it is 2.72mm thick, which means it is thin enough to fit inside the 5.6mm ‌iPhone Air‌.

Amp is one of the many, and one of Adam's favorite agentic coding tools to use. What makes it different is how they've engineered to it to maximize what’s possible with today’s frontier models. Autonomous reasoning, access to the oracle, comprehensive code editing, and complex task execution. That's nearly verbatim from their homepage, but it's also exactly what Adam has experienced. They talk through all things agents, how Adam might have been holding Amp wrong, and they even talked through Adam's idea called "Agent Flow".

<p>More so, this kind of rapid learning, innovation, and sense making is exactly what a platform like Tanzu Platform with Cloud Foundry is excels at, and has a long, proven history of supporting.</p>
<p>You focus on learning new business models, features for your apps, and what works by writing and deploying code instead of building containers and configuring infrastructure.</p>

<p>There’s a creeping notion that Claude Code (and OpenAI Codex, I guess) are very useful for things that are not code. In the Obsidian community, where you keep your decades of notes as plain text, markdown files, some people are using Claude Code to do analysis, reformatting, etc. of their notes. I can see that you could do the same thing with the pile of Dungeons &amp; Dragons stuff I have laying around.</p>
