            <b>Published:</b> 2023-05-31 13:22:56-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Popular virtual reality rhythm game Beat Saber could be one title that Apple is planning to promote for its upcoming AR/VR headset, according to a tweet shared by Beat Games co-founder Jaroslav Beck.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Beck today shared a tweet about June 5th, saying that the date would be "🍿🕶️," which seems to hint that a version of Beat Saber for the Apple AR/VR headset could perhaps be part of Apple's presentation. Beat Saber for Apple's platform is just speculation at this point, but Beck does not regularly tweet about Apple, and would seemingly have no reason to comment on the event.

            Apple is overtly teasing the start of "a new era" and the ability to "code new worlds" at WWDC this year, building anticipation around the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/15/kuo-apple-well-prepared-headset-unveiling/">widely expected</a> announcement of its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ar-vr/">mixed-reality headset</a>.

<br/>
A tweet shared by Apple earlier today made the "new era" remark, seemingly leaning into the high expectations surrounding next week's WWDC keynote. The launch of a major new device and operating system, something that has not occurred since the debut of the original Apple Watch in September 2014, would certainly seem to justify the start of a new era for the company.
