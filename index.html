            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            A common request from Apple Watch users over the years has been the ability to use third-party watch faces, but watchOS 10 still does not support this. In an interview with <a href="https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/man-muss-sachen-in-2-sekunden-erledigen-koennen-das-klingt-erst-mal-verrueckt-kurz-959818947913">Swiss newspaper <em>Tages-Anzeiger</em></a> published today, Apple's VP of Technology Kevin Lynch and product marketing employee Deidre Caldbeck explained why.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple this week shared a new action-packed video called "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azJKMr-F48A">The Great Escape</a>" on its YouTube channel in Turkey. The video, set in Istanbul's historic Grand Bazaar, was shot entirely on the iPhone 14 Pro with the use of additional accessories and software.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
"The Great Escape" has received over three million views on YouTube since being uploaded on Sunday, showing the continued popularity of Apple's long-running "Shot on iPhone" marketing campaign. The video highlights several camera features available on the iPhone 14 Pro, such as Macro mode, Cinematic mode, and Action mode.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-06-19 07:59:43-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When Apple releases iOS 17 in the fall, anyone who tends to use their iPhone's camera to scan QR codes can expect to find the process a little easier, thanks to a small but significant change coming in Apple's latest mobile operating system.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900955" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/qr-code-ios-17.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
Apple first introduced iPhone Camera app support for QR code scanning in iOS 11. Back then, the URL link that the QR code generated would appear as though it was a push notification at the top of the screen. 
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps because this implementation was inelegant or confusing for some users, Apple in iOS 13 decided to redesign QR code scanning so that the link appeared as a yellow button within the camera viewfinder itself. However, in doing so, it created a new problem: The button would rove around in the viewfinder if the camera lens was also in motion, which made tapping it even [...]<br>

            Linear Perspective cannot be immediately followed by either the "prospettiva de' perdimenti" or the "prospettiva de' colori" or the aerial perspective; since these branches of the subject presuppose a knowledge of the principles of Light and Shade. No apology, therefore, is here needed for placing these immediately after Linear Perspective.
We have various plans suggested by Leonardo for the arrangement of the mass of materials treating of this subject. Among these I have given the preference to a scheme propounded in No. III, because, in all probability, we have here a final and definite purpose expressed. Several authors have expressed it as their opinion that the Paris Manuscript C is a complete and finished treatise on Light and Shade. Certainly, the Principles of Light and Shade form by far the larger portion of this MS. which consists of two separate parts; still, the materials are far from being finally arranged.

In his <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1670619672096686080?s=20">latest Twitter post</a>, Kuo said upgrading the UWB processor, which Apple currently calls the U1 chip, is part of a plan to "aggressively upgrade hardware specifications to build a more competitive ecosystem for Vision Pro." Kuo goes on:
<br/>
<blockquote>The ecosystem is one of the key success factors for Vision Pro, including the integration with other Apple hardware products, and related main hardware specifications are Wi-Fi and UWB.
<br/>
<br/>
iPhone 15 will likely see an specification upgrade of UWB, with the production process moving from 16nm to more advan</blockquote> [...]<br>

            Starting with iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and macOS Sonoma, Safari automatically removes tracking parameters from URLs while in Private Browsing Mode, in order to prevent cross-website tracking. When a tracking parameter is detected while browsing or copying a link, Apple says Safari strips the identifying components of the URL, while leaving the rest intact. The links will still work as expected, but will no longer have unique identifiers.
