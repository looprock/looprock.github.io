            Apple in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> beta has changed the text that provides details on the Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfer time for Apple Savings account holders.

<br/>
In ‌iOS 17‌ beta 2, it now reads "Funds are typically available for withdrawal by the 5th business day" when a transfer is made. Prior to the beta, it said that transfers "typically take 1-3 business days to complete." The 1-3 day wording still exists in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/">iOS 16</a>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the time as “The Styles Case” has now somewhat subsided. Nevertheless, in view of the world-wide notoriety which attended it, I have been asked, both by my friend Poirot and the family themselves, to write an account of the whole story. This, we trust, will effectually silence the sensational rumours which still persist.
I will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my being connected with the affair.
I had been invalided home from the Front; and, after spending some months in a rather depressing Convalescent Home, was given a month’s sick leave. Having no near relations or friends, I was trying to make up my mind what to do, when I ran across John Cavendish. I had seen very little of him for some years. Indeed, I had never known him particularly well. He was a good fifteen years my senior, for one thing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years. As a boy, though, I had often stayed at Styles, his mother’s place in Essex.

Coming from a convalescent influenza patient, I hailed the remark as showing a beneficial optimism. I myself had been the first sufferer from the disease. Poirot in his turn had gone down. He was now sitting up in bed, propped up with pillows.
