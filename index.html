            WhatsApp is rolling out a new feature that allows users to tag other people in their Status updates, further enhancing the platform's Instagram Stories-like functionality. The addition aims to make it easier for users to connect with friends and family on the popular messaging app.

The new tagging feature enables users to mention up to five other WhatsApp accounts in their Status updates.
