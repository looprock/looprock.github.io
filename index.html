            North Carolina has approved Apple's request to push back the hiring and investment milestones tied to its long-delayed Research Triangle Park campus, effectively restarting the incentive agreement that could be worth up to $845 million to the company, <a href="https://www.heraldonline.com/news/state/north-carolina/article313037807.html">the <em>Herald</em></a> reports.

North Carolina's Economic Investment Committee voted this week to grant Apple a four-year extension on the timelines originally established when the company secured a rare "transformative" Job Investment Grant in 2021. The move follows Apple's confirmation last year that it had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/apple-north-carolina-campus-paused/">paused construction plans</a> and was seeking to renegotiate the agreement with the state.

            Apple today shared its annual holiday season ad, titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-avONMmQtlI"><em>A Critter Carol</em></a>, as well as a behind-the-scenes video showing how it was made.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
In the short film, set in a snowy forest, a group of woodland creatures use a lost iPhone 17 Pro to film themselves singing about the gift of friendship. Later, the owner of the iPhone finds the device with help from the Find My app on his Apple Watch, and he then discovers the critters' heartwarming recording.
<br/>
<br/>
In an AI world, Apple's ad emphasizes the use of practical effects. The critters — a raccoon, bear, owl, deer, squirrel, and others — are handcrafted puppets.
<br/>
<br/>
The short film was shot entirely on the iPhone 17 Pro, according to Apple, although the fine print says that additional hardware and software was used. The behind-the-scenes video shows how the ad was made by puppeteers, and how the typography used throughout the ca [...]<br>

<br/>
Last year, India passed a law that allows the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to use global turnover when calculating penalties imposed on companies for abusing market dominance. Apple can be fined up to 10 percent, which would result in a penalty of around $38 billion. Apple said that using global turnover would result in a fine that's "manifestly arbitrary, unconstitutional, grossly disproportionate, and unjust."

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            AI service <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai">Perplexity</a> was this week updated with a new <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/shopping-that-puts-you-first">personalized shopping experience</a> that's designed to help users rediscover the joy of shopping.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Perplexity offers conversational search that incorporates the user's history and wants when looking for item suggestions. The Perplexity team suggests that the AI is able to understand each shopper's unique needs better than a search algorithm that's optimized for advertiser dollars.
<br/>
<br/>
The search engine is able to remember past searches, learning each user's design preferences. Results are displayed in product cards rather than scrollable grids, with the cards featuring spec lists and reviews. Perplexity supports checking out with PayPal directly from the Perplexity interface, though this is currently limited to supported merchants like Fabletics, Adorama, and NewEgg.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Christie's is preparing to auction off the original partnership contract that created the Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, valuing it in the region of $2-4 million.  
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028240" height="2160" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/apple-computer-corporate-founding-documents@2x.jpg" width="3840"/>
<br/>
The original three-page document served as the contract among Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ron Wayne. The agreement established initial shares at 45% for Jobs, 45% for Wozniak, and 10% for Wayne.
<br/>
<br/>
Additional papers documenting Wayne's withdrawal as a partner just 12 days after the company was formed are also included in the auction package. Wayne initially received $800 for his 10% share of the company, and later received an additional $1,500 payment.

Wayne later stated he withdrew because he knew the venture would be a "roller coaster" and that the high-stakes ride was not for him. [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            OpenAI has updated the voice feature in its ChatGPT app so that voice conversations now happen directly inside an ongoing chat instead of forcing users into a separate voice-only session.

The change means responses <a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1993381101369458763?s=20">now appear in real-time with text</a> – plus any visuals like images and maps – as you speak, making switching between voice and text smoother while preserving chat history and context.

Previously, when you used "Advanced Voice Mode," voice chats opened in their own window, which would exit your current conversation and knock you out of your workflow. The update means voice and text interactions are now integrated in one seamless conversation thread.
