<p>Salesforce claims that its (newly renamed) Agentforce 360 product has 6,000 paying customers. But in customer conversations and sessions, we saw little adoption or impact from AI agents &ndash; lots of potential but a long way to go for a meaningful ROI.</p>

            <p>Everyone needs to stop thinking about enterprise AI as a way to fire people and think about how to use AI to make people more productive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/29/forrester_ai_rehiring/">Forrester‚Äôs analysis</a> found that using AI for financially driven layoffs can backfire: 55 percent of employers regret laying off workers because of AI. More people in charge of AI investment expect it to increase headcount (57 percent) than to decrease it (15 percent) over the next year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Either that, or start by replacing the executives with an AI. A more retention friendly alternate would be to give staff a month long sabbatical and require executives to only use AIs for a month. If they wanted to be really 9-9-6, make that quarter sabbatical .</p>
<p>And, as <a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/salesforce-dreams-of-the-agentic-enterprise/">Forrest wrote elsewhere</a>, on Salesforce AI talk:</p>

Over the past week, Nvidia's shares have climbed 14.5 percent due to demand for its GPUs and the possibility that it might be able to sell its most advanced chips in China. As of now, the U.S. prevents Nvidia from selling its Blackwell AI chips to China, and China has also restricted Chinese companies from importing some Nvidia chips because of national security concerns.

            Apple researchers have released <a href="https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19808">Pico-Banana-400K</a>, a comprehensive dataset of 400,000 curated images that's been specifically designed to improve how AI systems edit photos based on text prompts.

<br/>
The massive dataset aims to address what Apple describes as a gap in current AI image editing training. While systems like GPT-4o can make impressive edits, the researchers say progress has been limited by inadequate training data built from real photographs. Apple's new dataset aims to improve the situation.

Pico-Banana-400K features images organized into 35 different edit types across eight categories, from basic adjustments like color changes to complex transformations such as converting people into Pixar-style characters or LEGO figures. Each image went throu [...]<br>
