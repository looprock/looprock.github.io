            Apple is rumored to be planning a redesigned iPhone model for release in 2027, to mark the 20th anniversary of the device's launch. However, a source with a proven track record has now cast doubt on the device featuring an all-screen design.

<br/>
In his <em>Power On</em> newsletter last month, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/20th-anniversary-iphone-all-screen-design/">planning a 20th-anniversary iPhone</a> model "without any cutouts in the display." He <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/08/ios-26-liquid-glass-20th-anniversary-iphone/">later added</a> that the device would have "extraordinarily slim bezels" around the screen, along with "curved glass sides around the entire phone, even at the edges."

The company is under pressure to make significant changes to its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> policies in the European Union after being fined €500 million earlier this year for preventing developers from directing users to alternative purchasing options outside of Apple's in-app payment system.

<h2>iPhone 17 Models</h2>
<br/>
Last year, Apple chose soft, pastel-inspired finishes for its iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus models. They are available in ultramarine, teal, pink, white, and black. The yellow that the iPhone 15 comes in is notably missing, having been replaced by the darker blue hue of the ultramarine. Together, the iPhone 16 colors appear more saturated and vivid – pink and ultramarine especially show a bolder, more confident hue compared to the pastel washes of the iPhone 15.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's February launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-announces-iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a>, which replaced the iPhone SE line, marked a strategic shift in the company's flagship smartphone lineup. Starting at $599, the iPhone 16e offers a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, an A18 chip, and a USB-C port, positioning it as a more affordable alternative within the iPhone 16 family. Does that mean we should expect an iPhone 17e to be added to the upcoming iPhone 17 series?
