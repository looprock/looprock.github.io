            Disney+ has announced a new "Paid Sharing" program across multiple countries, including the United States, Canada, and parts of Europe, as its global account sharing crackdown kicks up a gear. The move, which was announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/disney-plus-password-sharing-crackdown/">earlier this year</a> by Disney CEO Bob Iger, aims to boost revenue and subscriber growth for the streaming service.

<br/>
Similar to Netflix's approach, the new system restricts account usage to members of a single household. Disney+ <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/paid-sharing-disney-explainer/">defines a household</a> as "a collection of devices associated with your primary personal residence that are used by the individuals who reside there."

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18, Apple added several new accessibility features, and one feature in particular that is likely to have widespread appeal among car passengers is Vehicle Motion Cues, which aims to prevent motion sickness when looking at an iPhone or iPad.
<br/>

<br/>
According to Apple, research shows that motion sickness is commonly caused by a sensory conflict between what a person sees and what they feel, which can prevent some users from comfortably using an ‌iPhone‌ or ‌iPad‌ while riding in a moving vehicle.
<br/>
<br/>
Vehicle Motion Cues are designed to avoid this sensory conflict with the use of visual elements on the display that indicate real-time changes in motion. Apple explains:

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Facebook parent company Meta today unveiled "the most advanced pair of AR glasses ever made," called Orion. Meta claims Orion looks and feels like a regular pair of glasses, but with augmented reality capabilities.

<br/>
The glasses have been in development for the last five years, and Meta describes them as lightweight and great for indoor and outdoor use. Unlike a VR headset, AR glasses augment the real world rather than shutting it out, providing digital experiences that are not constrained by the display of a smartphone or headset.<blockquote>Orion has the largest field of view in the smallest AR glasses form to date. That field of view unlocks truly immersive use cases for Orion, from multitasking windows and big-screen entertainment to life-size holograms of people - all digital content that can seamlessly blend with </blockquote> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iOS 18 brings a significant redesign to the Photos app, introducing a unified Library View that consolidates all sections into a single, scrollable interface. While this new layout <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-navigating-redesigned-photos-app/">aims to streamline navigation</a>, you may want to tailor it to your preferences.

<h2>Understanding Collections in Photos</h2>
<br/>
In iOS 18, everything outside the main photo grid in the Photos app is considered a "Collection." These include:

<li><strong>Recent Days</strong>: Chronological view of your latest photos, similar to the previous iOS 17 Days view. Tap to see your entire library sorted by date.</li>

            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a>'s high-yield savings account received an interest rate cut overnight, the second time it has done so this year.

<br/>
The ‌Apple Card‌ savings account's annual percentage yield (APY) dropped from 4.4% to 4.25%, in line with the US Federal Reserve approving an aggressive rate cut of 50 basis points last week. Push notifications regarding the cut were sent to ‌Apple Card‌ users on Tuesday evening.
<br/>
<br/>
When the ‌Apple Card‌'s savings account first became available, it offered an APY of 4.15%. The rate then increased three times, first to 4.25%, then to 4.35%, and finally to 4.5%, before being lowered to 4.4% in April 2024.

<p id="EkLaRj">Amazon Prime Day is one of the biggest shopping events of the year outside of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, with this year’s autumnal incarnation (once again dubbed Prime Big Deal Days) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/17/24244180/amazon-october-prime-day-big-deal-days-fall-dates-2024">running from October 8th through the 9th.</a> The two-day shopping affair will likely grant Prime members access to some of the best prices of the year on Amazon devices, as well as products from Sony, Sonos, Peloton, Withings, and other well-known brands. This applies to items spanning a range of categories, including gaming peripherals, laptops, 4K TVs, phones, PC accessories, and more. </p>
