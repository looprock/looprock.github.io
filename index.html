According <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/the-ai-boom-is-coming-for-apples-profit-margins-4774013d">to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, Apple is exploring whether some of its lower-end processors could be manufactured by a company other than TSMC.

"Now that TSMC is doing more business with Nvidia and other AI companies, people with knowledge of the chip supply chain said Apple was exploring whether some lower-end processors could be made by someone other than TSMC," the report said.
<br/>
<br/>
The report did not mention any candidates, but previous rumors have indicated that Intel could begin supplying some lower-end Apple processors in 2027 or 2028.

<br/>
A so-called "iPhone Flip" — unlikely to be the real name — would compete with devices such as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/samsung-galaxy-z-fold7/">Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> and the <a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/en/family/razr2025">modern-day Motorola Razr</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
The clamshell iPhone would be released at some point after Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">first foldable iPhone</a>, which is expected to launch in September this year.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is planning to launch new MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips alongside macOS 26.3, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974025" height="2160" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-MacBook-Pro-M4-hero.jpg" width="3840"/>

"Apple's faster MacBook Pros are planned for the macOS 26.3 release cycle," wrote Gurman, in his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-01/apple-s-record-quarter-and-ai-changes-macbook-pro-update-clamshell-iphone-fold"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today.

<br/>
"I'm told the new models — code-named J714 and J716 — are slated for the macOS 26.3 software cycle, which runs from February through March," he explained.
<br/>
<br/>
macOS 26.3 remains in beta testing, but the update should be coming soon, with a wide release expected in February. Gurman was careful to also mention March, but this seems rather unlikely, unless the macOS 26.3 bet [...]<br>

            Apple recently <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/">updated its online store</a> with a new ordering process for Macs, including the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, Mac mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro.

<br/>
There used to be a handful of standard configurations available for each Mac, but now you must configure a Mac entirely from scratch on a feature-by-feature basis. In other words, ordering a new Mac now works much like ordering an iPad.

            <p>I just gave a new presentation at <a class="txt2html" href="https://p2d2.cz/en/" style="text-decoration: underline dotted;">Prague PostgreSQL Developer Day</a> titled <a class="major" href="https://momjian.us/main/presentations/pending.html#missing" style="text-decoration: underline;">What's Missing in
Postgres?</a>  It's an unusual talk because it explains the missing features of Postgres, and why.  One thing I learned in writing the talk is that the majority of our missing features
are performance-related, rather than functionality-related.  I took many questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>some pointed out that extensions supply much of this missing functionality
  </li><li>some supported the lack of features because the features are either unnecessary or harmful
  </li><li>some features are in-progress (<a class="txt2html" href="https://momjian.us/main/writings/pgsql/missing.pdf#page=31" style="text-decoration: underline dotted;">slide 31</a>)
