            If you have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, you're undoubtedly going to get requests from friends and family members who want to give it a try.

Apple suggests that guests should have their own personalized Light Seal, but Light Seals are priced at $200, so that's quite a steep add-on cost.

<h2>Visual Discomfort</h2>
<br/>
Vision Pro users who <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213946">experience visual discomfort</a> such as blurry vision, double vision, dry eyes, watery eyes, light sensitivity, and eye strain should stop using Vision Pro and wait for symptoms to resolve.
<br/>
<br/>
To minimize visual discomfort, Apple says that a good fit is essential, with pressure balanced across the nose and cheeks and the proper alignment set up. Vision Pro should be used in short increments of time to start with, and Apple recommends regular breaks every 20 to 30 minutes.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Like the iPhone, the Vision Pro has an always-on battery management system that could lead to reduced performance in certain situations, according to Apple.

<br/>
In a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213955">support document</a> published today, Apple said Vision Pro users could notice impacts such as longer app launch times, lower frame rates, reduced wireless speeds, screen dimming, or lower speaker volume in situations where the Vision Pro is low on battery, has a chemically aged battery, or is in a peak-power state.
<br/>

            Apple today shared a detailed <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213964">support document</a> explaining how to clean the Vision Pro headset and all of its accompanying components.

Apple warns that disinfectants like isopropyl alcohol, Windex, and Clorox should not be used to clean the Vision Pro. Instead, users should simply use a dry or slightly damp cloth.
<br/>
<br/>
To clean the cover glass of the Vision Pro, Apple simply encourages use of a clean, dry microfiber cloth like the polishing cloth included with the headset. If necessary, users can also spray ZEISS cleaning fluid on the cloth before wiping the Vision Pro.

            Apple is considering launching its first foldable in the next few years in the form of a 7- to 8-inch device that could ultimately replace the 8.3-inch iPad mini.

That's the latest claim to come out of Korean outlet <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=25724">The Elec</a></em>. According to the report, Apple is reviewing a launch timeframe for the device between 2026 and 2027.
