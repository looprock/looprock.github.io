            <b>Published:</b> 2026-02-12 16:11:13-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple did not infringe on any patents owned by Texas-based company Optis Wireless, a jury ruled today. In a verdict shared by <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/apple-fends-off-4g-wireless-patent-lawsuit-third-trial-2026-02-12/">Reuters</a></em>, the jury decided that Apple did not infringe any of the five LTE patents that Optis sued over back in 2019. If Optis had won, Apple could have faced hundreds of millions in damages.

A second jury trial was held in 2021 to recalculate damages, and the jury awarded Optis $300 million. Apple again appealed, and t [...]<br>
