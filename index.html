Following calls from a bipartisan group of senators for a DOJ investigation into the matter, Beeper founder Eric Migicovsky reportedly met with DOJ antitrust lawyers on Tuesday, December 12.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When the Apple Watch import ban goes into effect after December 25, 2023, Apple will not be able to repair out-of-warranty Apple Watch models in the United States. Apple Watch repairs typically involve replacing a broken unit with a new model rather than fixing an individual component, and replacement devices will not be available.

<br/>
Apple shared the news with retail employees in a memo that was sent out this week. Portions of the memo were seen by <em>MacRumors</em>, and it was also shared by <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-21/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-ban-means-no-repairs-on-out-of-warranty-models">Bloomberg</a></em>.

Apple AI researchers say they have made a key breakthrough in deploying large language models (LLMs) on iPhones and other Apple devices with limited memory by inventing an innovative flash memory utilization technique.

<br/>
<h2>LLMs and Memory Constraints</h2>
<br/>
LLM-based chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude are incredibly data and memory-intensive, typically requiring vast amounts of memory to function, which is a challenge for devices like iPhones that have limited memory capacity. To tackle this issue, Apple researchers have developed a novel technique that uses flash memory – the same memory where your apps and photos live – to store the AI model's data.
