            <b>Published:</b> 2026-01-02 16:33:00-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is planning to release a low-cost MacBook in 2026, which will apparently compete with more affordable Chromebooks and Windows PCs. Apple's most affordable Mac right now is the $999 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, and the upcoming low-cost MacBook is expected to be cheaper. Here's what we know about the low-cost MacBook so far.

<h2>Size</h2>
<br/>
Rumors suggest the low-cost MacBook will have a display that's around 13 inches in size. The ‌MacBook Air‌ has a 13.6-inch display, so the more affordable MacBook will likely be slightly smaller. It's sounding like it won't be too far off from the 13-inch ‌MacBook Air‌, though.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Pebble today announced that it is bringing back the Pebble Time Round, one of its most iconic smartwatches from a decade ago. The new Pebble Round 2 builds on the Pebble Time Round, eliminating some of the compromises that had to be made with the original model.

<br/>
The Pebble Round 2 features a bezel-free 1.3-inch color e-paper display, and it comes in matte black, brushed silver, and rose gold. Advances in Bluetooth technology mean that it lasts for up to two weeks before needing to be recharged, and it remains as thin as the original.

The device runs the open-source PebbleOS operating system, and it is designed to work with iOS and Android smartphones. It supports basic sleep tracking and activity tracking, but it is not a fitness watch, so there is no heart rate t [...]<br>

Data from IDC claims that Apple shipped 390,000 Vision Pro units in 2024. IDC expected Apple to ship just 45,000 new Vision Pro units in the latest quarter of 2025.

<blockquote>
<p>The choice of where and how to start your AI journey is a business decision, not a technology one. By grounding your AI efforts in the operational muscle you’ve already built with Java and Spring, you minimize friction and risk. Everyone just keeps doing what they’re doing, but with a new tool. This established operational and development life is the hard-won experience, paid for in decades of maintenance and gut-wrenching production failures, that gives you the platform to continuously absorb new capabilities like Spring AI and MCP.</p>
<p>Get the developer experience and the operator experience right, and you unlock the organizational velocity needed to turn tentative AI experiments into a mission-critical competitive advantage.</p>
