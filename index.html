            In the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/20/ios-26-1-liquid-glass-toggle/">fourth iOS 26.1 beta</a>, Apple added a "Tinted" option that reduces the translucency of Liquid Glass for those who prefer a more opaque look.

            It's been over four years since Apple launched its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a> network accessory program, and unlike the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTag</a>, Find My-compatible devices have been evolving.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Repair site iFixit today did one of its <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/114046/m5-macbook-pro-teardown">device teardowns on Apple's new M5 MacBook Pro model</a>, which Apple released on Wednesday.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Unsurprisingly, there are few changes to the device because the only new features are a new M5 chip and a faster SSD, but iFixit did find some subtle tweaks related to repairability.
<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a>'s casing is still secured with P5 screws, and battery replacement is more difficult than it needs to be because Apple only sells the battery as part of the main chassis that also includes the keyboard. Getting to the fan, ports, and other components inside the ‌MacBook Pro‌ requires removing the logic board, and iFixit says that essentially every component in the ‌MacBook Pro‌ has to come out to perform a battery replacement following Apple's official repair steps.

            Apple this month updated the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/apple-m5-chip-announcements/">14-inch MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, and Vision Pro</a> with its next-generation M5 chip, but there's one rumored new Apple product in particular that many will still be hoping to see before the holidays.

<br/>
Back in June, industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported that Apple is developing a "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-to-launch-low-cost-macbook/">more affordable</a>" 13-inch laptop to compete with Chromebooks and drive MacBook purchases. Kuo did not mention pricing, but he said that the new MacBook would use an A18 Pro chip, which debuted in the iPhone 16 Pro last year.

Using an iPhone chip would be a major divergence from Apple's usual strategy of using M-series chips in its Macs, but it m [...]<br>

"Apple plans to add support in upcoming iPhones as early as next year for 5G networks that aren't tethered to Earth's surface, which includes satellites," the report said. "That would give the iPhone full internet access over satellite," it added.

<br/>
Microsoft's Copilot Fall Release introduces <a href="https://youtu.be/mOjGOLHG6AY">Mico</a> – an animated orb that serves as the voice mode's visual companion. Mico (its name a nod to Microsoft Copilot) listens, reacts, and changes colors based on the user's interactions, with the aim of giving the AI chatbot a cuter, more approachable presence.
<br/>
<br/>
That said, Microsoft's attempt to soften its AI offering could backfire if users tap Mico repeatedly – the action briefly turns Mico into Clippy (officially named Clippit), the animated paperclip assistant that first appeared in Office 97 and became a fixture o [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Anthropic today said it is updating the Claude chatbot with a new memory feature, which will put Claude on par with ChatGPT. With memory enabled, Claude will be able to recall past conversations.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Anthropic first added memory to Claude earlier this year, but with the initial implementation, Claude would only recall details when specifically asked. In August, Anthropic expanded the memory feature to allow Claude to automatically remember conversation details without a specific user request, and that functionality has been limited to Team and Enterprise subscribers.
<br/>
<br/>
Claude's memory functionality is now expanding to all paid users, so Pro and Max subscribers can use the feature. Max users can turn it on now, while Pro subscribers will get access "over the coming days."
<br/>
<br/>
Memory is an opt-in feature that can be turned on in Claude's settings. There are options for "search and reference chats" and "generate memory from chat history."  [...]<br>

            Earlier this month, IKEA debuted a tiny NFC-enabled bed that's meant to help smartphone users cut down on nighttime usage. The small "Phone Sleep Collection" is modeled after an actual IKEA bed, and it uses the IKEA app to monitor scroll-free sleep time.

- Download the IKEA UAE app.
<br/>
- (For iOS users) When prompted, allow Motion &amp; Fitness tracking.
