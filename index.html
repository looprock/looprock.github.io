            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iOS 18.2, Apple introduced ChatGPT integration with Apple Intelligence to expand your iPhone's AI capabilities in several ways. When enabled, Siri can leverage ChatGPT for complex queries about photos and documents, and the integration also extends to Writing Tools for text and image generation, while Visual Intelligence helps identify objects and places using your iPhone's camera.

            Apple's latest macOS Sequoia 15.2 update has introduced a critical bug that prevents the popular backup utility <a href="https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper</a> from creating bootable backups, according to the app's chief developer, Shirt Pocket's <a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/youre_a_mean_one/">Dave Nanian</a>.

The issue stems from a "Resource Busy" error that occurs during the final stages of the backup process when attempting to copy system preboot or recovery files.
