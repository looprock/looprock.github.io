The ‌Apple Card‌ savings account's annual percentage yield (APY) dropped from 4.4% to 4.25%, in line with the US Federal Reserve approving an aggressive rate cut of 50 basis points last week. Push notifications regarding the cut were sent to ‌Apple Card‌ users on Tuesday evening.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models that came out last year, Apple added an opt-in battery setting that limits maximum charge to 80 percent. The idea is that never charging the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> above 80 percent will increase battery longevity, so I kept my ‌iPhone‌ at that 80 percent limit from September 2023 to now, with no cheating.

            Apple's latest iPhone 16 models include a new Camera Control button (located on the lower right-hand side when holding the phone in portrait mode).

            Apple's latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models feature a second-generation Ceramic Shield material, which Apple says is even tougher than the prior-generation Ceramic Shield. Device insurance provider Allstate Protection Plans today published the results of its annual device drop test, giving us insight into the durability of the new iPhones.

            Back in May, Sonos launched a new version of its mobile app, and it's been wildly unpopular with Sonos customers because of ongoing bugs and the removal of several features.
