            <b>Published:</b> 2023-08-27 21:59:01+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            India launched its second lunar mission [Chandrayaan 2], which consisted of an orbiter named Vikram lander and a rover named Pragyan. The goal of the mission was to study the soil and surface composition of the moon and to discover water in the form of ice. The mission failed when the lander deviated from its intended trajectory and crashed onto the lunar surface while attempting to make a soft land on 6th September 2019.<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-08-27 21:51:13+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The useReducer hook in React allows you to manage complex state logic in a more organized and predictable manner. It is particularly useful when dealing with states that involve multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous state. We will explore its concepts, and benefits, and provide practical examples that cater to both beginners and advanced developers.<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-08-27 21:35:31+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based format ideal for clear, scalable, and interactive data visualization. Unlike raster formats, SVG maintains quality regardless of resolution. It's best for designs needing precision and scalability. SVG suits vector graphics, while raster graphics are made of pixels and work well for complex images. SVG's key attributes for data visualization include resolution independence, interactivity, animation, and accessibility. It employs a Cartesian coordinate system to position elements. SVG syntax involves XML tags and data binding through libraries like D3.js. Styling with CSS enhances customization. Best practices include performance optimization, responsiveness, and diverse use cases like interactive maps.<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-08-27 21:22:33+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Redesigning apps involves multiple stages: pre-launch iterations, deciding changes based on market research, and testing internally. For established apps, valid reasons for redesign include shifting vision, differentiation, and transformation. The redesign of Promova, a language-learning app, was driven by such factors. Redesign serves both as a responsibility and an opportunity. Maintaining design integrity, testing on various scales, and simplifying design for better cognitive load are essential. Redesigning on the web first aids cost-effective testing. Indentation helped organize the design. Redesign should be seen as a chance to rectify past issues, experiment, and develop optimal design systems. In Promova's case, lesson feed, hierarchy, and preserving original illustrations were improved. Consistent animations, platform transitions, and engaging onboarding enhance the experience. Promova's redesign resulted in doubled lesson engagement, 30% higher conversion, 20-point onboarding increase, and 30% longer [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-08-27 12:09:08-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> will launch alongside a redesigned Magic Keyboard accessory that makes the device more laptop-like, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-08-27 19:06:53+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Agent Dingo library simplifies the integration of external functions into Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. Agents are mechanisms that enable LLMs to use external functions based on user input. Previous integration required careful prompts and parsing. GPT's latest version introduces function-calling capabilities with a fixed structure for function description. Agent Dingo further streamlines the process by enabling function integration using just one line of code. It provides a clear structure for functions, automatic docstring generation, and the ability to serve agents on OpenAI-compatible web servers. This library minimizes the overhead and complexity of integrating functions into LLMs, allowing developers to focus on core functionality.<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-08-27 18:53:25+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Decentralized Finance (DeFi) offers promising solutions but faces obstacles hindering mainstream adoption. DeFi, operating on blockchain without intermediaries, challenges traditional finance. However, complexities, security risks, regulatory issues, and scams impede its growth. Security concerns involve wallet hacks, Ponzi schemes, and exit scams, leading to significant financial losses. Regulatory challenges stem from DeFi's decentralized nature conflicting with regulatory control. DeFi's complexity deters non-technical users and contributes to mistakes and losses. Hacks and scams in the DeFi space have led to substantial financial losses, discouraging trust and confidence. Addressing security issues is crucial for DeFi to transition from an option to a mainstream choice.<br>

            In this gripping installment of the "Phalanxes of Atlans" series, Victor Nelson and Richard Alden find themselves imprisoned in a cell surrounded by fearsome allosauri, monstrous creatures hungry for human flesh.

            An Apple-1 advertisement that was written by Steve Jobs recently sold for $175,759 at an auction <a href="https://www.rrauction.com/auctions/details/673">hosted by RR Auction</a>.

"Board only + manual, $75. A real deal" reads a part of the advertisement that Jobs wrote out. Jobs' signature is included, and the address listed is his parents' house, which is where Apple started out.
