            Remotely controlling the shutter on your iPhone's camera lets you include yourself in the photo while avoiding the limitations of a selfie. For example, it allows you to take a picture of a wider scene with you included in the frame, which is ideal for landscape shots or group photos. If your iPhone is on a tripod, taking the shot remotely also reduces the risk of camera shake. Here's how to do it – and you don't need an Apple Watch.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Foreign-branded smartphone shipments in China, dominated by Apple's iPhone, dropped dramatically in March 2025, plunging 49.6% year-over-year according to data released by The China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT).

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996656" height="2160" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Apple-iPhone-16-family-lineup.jpg" width="3840"/>
<br/>
The steep decline saw shipments fall to just 1.89 million units, down from 3.75 million during the same period last year. That shrinks Apple's share of the Chinese market to approximately 8%, while domestic brands now control 92% of smartphone shipments.
<br/>
<br/>
For the entire first quarter, non-Chinese brand shipments declined over 25%, while total smartphone shipments in China actually increased by 3.3%.

            Samsung today introduced the <a href="https://howl.link/chaeu38jiafc4">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, an ultra thin smartphone that will compete with Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> "Air." The Galaxy S25 Edge features a 6.7-inch AMOLED display and it measures in at 5.8mm thick.

Comparatively, rumors suggest that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a> will have a 6.6-inch display and a thickness of 5.5mm, so it may be slightly smaller and thinner than the S25 Edge.

            This post demonstrates how to build a Business Event Monitoring System (BEMS) on AWS that handles over 86 million daily events with near real-time visibility, cross-Region controls, and automated alerts for stuck events. You might deploy this system for business-level insights into how events are flowing through your organization or to visualize the flow of transactions in real time. Downstream services also will have the option to process and respond to events originating within the system or not.<br>

            Although originally written in 2018, the following concepts remain essential for developers working with concurrency. This blogpost focuses on concurrency, distinguishing it from parallelism by defining it as &ldquo;out of order&rdquo; execution. It emphasizes the importance of understanding workload types—CPU bound (e.g., summing, sorting) and IO bound (e.g., file reading)—to assess when concurrency is appropriate. Through practical examples and benchmarks, it shows that parallelism boosts performance for CPU bound tasks, while concurrency alone benefits IO bound workloads.<br>
