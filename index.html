<br/>
Apple's former design chief Jony Ive and Jobs both dreamed of an all-glass iPhone with a seamless, low-profile design. Apple has made progress towards this goal over the years, with the iPhone X doing away with thick bezels in favor of a notch in 2017, the iPhone 14 Pro models introducing a smaller Dynamic Island cutout in the screen in 2022, and now the iPhone Air topping the iPhone 6 as the thinnest iPhone ever.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-10 15:53:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> and 17 Pro Max, Apple introduced a new design for the rear of the device. Instead of a camera bump, we now have a camera plateau that spans almost the entire back of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. The camera plateau houses an upgraded camera system that includes a revamped Telephoto lens.
<br/>

<br/>
All three of the ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ and Pro Max cameras are 48 megapixels, and there are five zoom options across the lenses.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Telephoto Lens</h2>
<br/>
The 48-megapixel Fusion Telephoto lens is new, and an upgrade over the 12-megapixel Telephoto lens in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models. It supports 4x zoom, or a 100mm focal length equi [...]<br>

Rather than using titanium and glass, the ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ models have a unibody aluminum frame. There's aluminum around the camera plateau and at the back except for where there's a Ceramic Shield insert for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> charging.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-10 15:15:38-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today announced that its retail store <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/southcoastplaza/">at the South Coast Plaza</a> shopping mall, in Costa Mesa, California, has temporarily relocated.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1018435" height="1612" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/Apple-South-Coast-Plaza.jpeg" width="2880"/>
<br/>
Apple has opened a temporary store in the mall, just down the hall from its original location, which will presumably be renovated. The company has not indicated when the original store will reopen, but its renovations often take months.
<br/>
<br/>
Opened in 2001, Apple South Coast Plaza was one of the company's first retail locations, in the heart of Orange County. The mall is the largest in California.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple already <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-south-coast-plaza-moved-for-remodelling.2464641/">alerted some customers</a> about the store relocation via email last week, and today it p [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch Ultra 3, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> 3 all feature an upgraded 5G modem and antenna architecture, but 5G connectivity won't be available in some countries.

<br/>
5G is not listed as a supported feature for the new Apple Watch models in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and several other countries in Europe, South America, Africa, and Asia.
<br/>
<br/>
The upgraded connectivity is available in the United States, UK, Germany, France, Switzerland, Spain, UAE, Thailand, Japan, China, Singapore, India, and more.
<br/>
<br/>
It is not clear why 5G connectivity isn't an option in some countries, but it could be due to a lack of regulatory approval or carriers that simply haven't added support. During yeste [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple this week released a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MGD74LL/A/magsafe-charger-1-m">new version of its MagSafe Charger</a> with Qi2 25W certification. It is available to order now with a one-meter or two-meter USB-C cable attached to it, with pricing ranging from $39 to $49 in the United States.

<br/>
As far as we can tell, the only change with the new MagSafe Charger is support for Qi2 25W, also known as Qi 2.2.
