            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The first beta of iOS 18.4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/apple-releases-ios-18-4-beta-1/">is now available</a>, and it includes a small but useful change for CarPlay.

<br/>
As we noted in our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/everything-new-ios-18-4-beta-1/">list of iOS 18.4 features</a>, CarPlay now shows a third row of icons, up from two rows previously. However, this change is only visible in vehicles with a larger center display. For example, a MacRumors Forums member <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-4-beta-1-bug-fixes-changes-and-improvements.2449908/post-33753569">noticed the change</a> in a Toyota Tundra, which can be equipped with up to a 14-inch screen.
<br/>
<br/>
In our testing, CarPlay still showed two rows of four icons in a Honda Civic with a 9-inch screen.

            <p>I’d like to thank everyone who’s been reaching out and expressed support for another Monitorama event. Like many of you, I truly enjoy the community and environment we’ve created together, and look forward to each upcoming event with a palpable sense of excitement (and panic).</p><p>Unfortunately, we’re going to take a pause this year. The short story is that things just didn’t click into place like I’d hoped, and rather than deliver a compromised experience, I figure it makes more sense to just step back, regroup, and plan for an even more amazing event in the not-too-distant future.</p><p>If you have any questions or would just like to chat, feel free to connect at <a href="mailto:info@monitorama.com">info@monitorama.com</a> (or in the community Slack if you’re already a member). In the meantime I hope you’ll keep us in mind for 2026.</p><p>Yours truly,<br/>Jason Dixon</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*c8xKg-A0nok_LxUTMfpfmQ.jpeg"/></figure>&lt;img alt="" height="1" sr [...]<br>
