            Apple CEO Tim Cook has <a href="https://x.com/tim_cook/status/1933184451275821124">reminded us</a> that today marks the 20th anniversary of Steve Jobs giving an iconic commencement address at Stanford University.

<br/>
"It's hard to believe it's been 20 years since Steve told Stanford graduates to stay hungry and stay foolish," said Cook, in a social media post reflecting on the impactful speech. "His powerful advice still rings true, and I hope it helps guide this year's new grads as they begin their journey to become tomorrow's leaders."

To honor the 20th anniversary of the speech, The Steve Jobs Archive has uploaded a higher-quality video of the speech <a href="https://stevejobsarchive.com/exhibits/stay-hungry-stay-foolish">on its website</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiHZqamCD8c">YouTube</a>. [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iPhone development roadmap runs several years into the future and the company is continually working with suppliers on several successive iPhone models simultaneously, which is why we often get rumored features months ahead of launch. The iPhone 17 series is no different, and we already have a good idea of what to expect from Apple's 2025 smartphone lineup.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964745" height="1009" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-pro-models-1.jpg" width="1794"/>
<br/>
If you skipped the iPhone 16, or if you're just plain curious about what's on the horizon, here are 17 rumored features that we are expecting to arrive in time for Apple's successor lineup, the iPhone 17 series, which is likely to be released around mid-September.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is improving its AutoFill feature for one-time verification codes on iOS 26 and macOS Tahoe.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005890" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/One-Time-Code-AutoFill-Feature-2.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Software engineer <a href="https://x.com/wongmjane/status/1932282217218400556">Jane Manchun Wong discovered</a> that iOS 26 can automatically fill in one-time verification codes from third-party apps, like Google Voice. The feature previously only worked with codes from Apple's Messages app on the iPhone.
<br/>
<br/>
As noted by <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1932638639974207879"><em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris</a>, macOS Tahoe can automatically fill in one-time verification codes from the Messages app in Google Chrome and other third-party web browsers. The feature was previously limited to Safari on the Mac.

            CarPlay is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/ios-26-upgrades-carplay-in-five-ways/">gaining a lot of new features with iOS 26</a>, including a Liquid Glass design, Live Activities, widgets, the ability to use Tapbacks and view pinned conversations in the Messages app, and more. But that's not all, as Apple has outlined another change coming to CarPlay with iOS 26 in a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/216/">WWDC 2025 video</a> for developers.

Specifically, Apple said that iOS 26 will allow CarPlay users to interact with mapping apps using multi-touch gestures in supported vehicles. This will allow users to zoom and pan on the map with their fingers, just like they can on an iPhone.

<br/>
iPhone users will be able to wirelessly stream videos to the CarPlay screen using AirPlay, according to Apple. For safety reasons, video playback will only be available when the vehicle is parked, to prevent distracted driving. The connected iPhone will be able to detect when the vehicle is in motion and end playback.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that automakers need to add support for CarPlay with AirPlay video, so it will likely take some time to roll out. It appears that the AirPlay functionality will be available for both regular CarPlay and the higher-end <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/apples-carplay-ultra-now-available/">C</a> [...]<br>

            With iOS 26, Apple has introduced some major changes to the iPhone experience, headlined by the new Liquid Glass redesign that's available across <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/ios-26-supports-iphone-11-and-newer/">all compatible devices</a>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iPadOS 26, Apple has introduced a new multitasking UI that allows for several open apps at the same time. You can change the size of ‌iPad‌ app windows, move them on top of each other, and rearrange them as desired, much like on the Mac. In a new interview with <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/apples-craig-federighi-on-the-long-road-to-the-ipads-mac-like-multitasking/">Ars Technica</a></em>, Apple's software chief Craig Federighi has explained why the iPad took so long to gain proper windowed multitasking.

<br/>
The delay apparently stemmed from early hardware limitations. According to Federighi, original iPads lacked the power for true multitasking, and the touch-first interface demanded perfect responsiveness.

            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> features a whole new design material that Apple calls Liquid Glass, with a focus on transparency that lets the content on your display shine through the controls.

Apple has multiple Accessibility options that are designed to customize iOS for different visual needs, and one of these options is Reduce Transparency. Toggling on Reduce Transparency adds a darker background to translucent areas like the Control Center, app icons, and app folders, improving contrast.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's new Liquid Glass design is the big news of the week, because it's the first major design change we've had to iOS in years, and because it's the first design that extends across all of Apple's platforms. Liquid Glass is sure to evolve over the coming months, but we thought we'd share a first look for those who are excited to see what it looks like in action right now.

After updating to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, Liquid Glass is the first thing that you'll see. The Lock Screen features a new Liquid Glass design for the clock (opt-in, of course), and the time is able to be expanded so you can make it take up more of the display to better fit your wallpaper.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-11 08:55:10-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, Apple is introducing a deceptively simple feature that could transform your morning routine: customizable alarm snooze intervals.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005678" height="3078" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/alarm-snooze-duration-ios-26.jpg" width="5472"/>
<br/>
The update allows users to set snooze duration anywhere from 1 to 15 minutes, finally breaking free from the rigid 9-minute default that has frustrated iPhone users for years. You can access the feature by tapping any alarm and tapping the number next to "Snooze Duration" in the options.
<br/>
<br/>
While it might sound trivial, the change nixes a long-lingering frustration. Some people need just a quick 2-minute buffer before rising from their slumber, while others prefer a longer window to properly wake up. The fixed 9-minute interval – a holdover from mechanical alarm clock limitations – never made sense in the smartphone era.

<br/>
It's the kind of quality-of- [...]<br>

            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/04/music-lock-screen-widget-animated-artwork-ios-26/">rumor</a> was true: iOS 26 introduces an option to view full-screen animated album art on the iPhone's Lock Screen for certain Apple Music songs.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005668" height="896" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/iOS-26-Lock-Screen-Full-Screen-Album-Art.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
To enter the full-screen mode, simply tap on the album art in the Lock Screen's music player for the song that is currently playing, and the artwork will expand and become animated, which contributes to a more immersive listening experience.
<br/>
<br/>
Animated album art was already visible in the Apple Music app for many popular songs, and now it has come to the Lock Screen for the first time.
<br/>
<br/>
Not all songs have animated artwork, but the selection is growing.
