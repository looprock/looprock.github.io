            Media platform Plex <a href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/important-2025-plex-updates">today announced</a> that it is raising prices for the Plex Pass subscription service, marking the first price increase that Plex has introduced in a decade.

<br/>
Starting on April 29, the Plex Pass will cost $6.99 per month or $69.99 per year, with a lifetime purchase option available for $249.99. Right now, the lifetime Plex Pass costs $120, while the monthly option is $4.99 and the annual option is $39.99.

Plex says that it needs to raise prices to keep up with rising costs, and that the added funds will ensure that Plex is able to keep developing new features.

            The European Commission today announced a <a href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/questions-and-answers/interoperability_en">long list of changes</a> that Apple is legally required to implement in future iOS 19 and iOS 20 updates.

The announcement clarifies interoperability requirements that Apple is required to adhere to in the EU, under the Digital Markets Act, which has been fully enforced since March 2024. The changes will further open up the iPhone and its technologies to competing companies and devices, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/19/apple-eu-interoperability-bad-for-products-users/">Apple is really unhappy about it</a>.

            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a> includes Apple's first custom-designed C1 modem, and since it's a new chip category for Apple, there have been questions about how the C1 measures up to the Qualcomm modems that Apple has been using for years. As it turns out, the ‌iPhone 16e‌ performs almost as well or better than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> in many speed tests that compare sub-6GHz performance, but it does vary by network.

            It&#8217;s best to view Elon Musk&#8217;s DOGE as an attack. While right wing propaganda (and gullible media outlets and politicians) frame DOGE as a &#8220;cost saving&#8221; effort at &#8220;improving government efficiency,&#8221; that&#8217;s just flimsy-ass cover for its real purpose: the dismantling of corporate oversight, environmental guard rails, consumer protection, civil rights, and the social safety [&#8230;]<br>

            In macOS, you can easily convert the format of images using a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/convert-images-macos-finder/">Quick Action</a> in Finder or you can achieve the same thing via the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/batch-convert-images-to-different-formats-using-macos-preview/">Preview app</a>, but if your daily workflow requires you to repeatedly convert images – for uploading to a blog, for example – then using a Folder Action can be a much faster way of getting the job done.

Without protections of encryption, an attacker on the same Wi-Fi network could redirect a user's browser to a clone phishing site where login details could be stolen. The vulnerability was first discovered by developer Mysk's security researchers and reported in September.

            Along with a foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, Apple is working on a larger foldable device that's somewhere around 19 inches, but rumors have been split on whether it's an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> or a Mac. Some reports refer to the device as an ‌iPad‌, while some call it a Mac, and the split seems to come down to the operating system on the device.

<h2>Is it a Mac?</h2>

Some rumors have suggested that Apple is developing a foldable MacBook with an all-display design. The MacBook already has a foldable design, of course, but the difference here would be a single display without an included keyboard and trackpad.

It is not unusual for Apple to stop signing older versions of iOS after releasing an update. Software that is not signed cannot be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side verification check, and it keeps ‌iPhone‌ users from installing outdated versions of iOS. ‌iPhone‌ models compatible with ‌iOS 18‌ are only eligible to download and run iOS 18.3.2 at this time.
