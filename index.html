I was able to test the Doorbell Camera Hub G410 ahead of launch, and it's a solid doorbell camera, and even better if you have an Aqara setup or plan to get more Aqara products. The G410 includes a Matter controller and it is able to serve as a hub for other Aqara Zigbee devices, like Aqara's door locks, so you don't need a standalone hub that doesn't serve another purpose. For Thread-based devices, it's also a Thread border router that can improve connectivity.

            Apple will launch its new iPhone 17 series in two months, and the iPhone 17 Pro models are expected to get a new design for the rear casing and the camera area. But more significant changes to the lineup are not expected until next year, when the iPhone 18 models arrive.

According to leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/5821279480/PzXj5sM8I">Fixed Focus Digital</a> on Weibo, the iPhone 17 will stick with 8GB of RAM while the iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will jump to 12GB.
