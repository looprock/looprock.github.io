Final Cut Pro has been version 10 since 2011, but after 13 years, Apple is finally ready to debut Final Cut Pro 11.

With Final Cut Pro 11, Apple is making sure to take advantage of the full power of its M-series chips. Magnetic Mask, a new AI-powered tool, lets video editors isolate people and objects in a video clip without a green screen or time-consuming rotoscoping.

            Apple last week replaced the M3 Max <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> with the new M4 Max ‌MacBook Pro‌, and we picked up one of the new high-end ‌MacBook Pro‌ machines to see how it compares to the prior model with both benchmarks and real-world tests.

<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
We tested an M4 Max with a 16-core CPU, 40-core GPU, and 48GB RAM against an M3 Max ‌MacBook Pro‌ with similar specs. The two machines look similar, but the display on the M4 version did get some improvements and it's a little bit brighter. There's an option for nano-texture too, which makes a big difference if you ever work outside.
<br/>
<br/>
Thunderbolt 5 ports instead of Thunderbolt 4 ports allow you to connect more displays (up to three 6K displays) and get faster transfer speeds. Unsurprisingly, the M4 Max performed better across the board on benchmarks, and those higher numbers did indeed translate to actual improvements in day- [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18, Apple has introduced a clever new way to identify if your iPhone charging setup is running at less than optimal speeds. The new feature appears directly in Settings, making it easy to spot when you're not getting the fastest possible charge.

<br/>
The Battery section displays a <strong>Slow Charger</strong> message when your iPhone detects a "slow" charger in use. You'll also see charging periods with an orange bar. This visual indicator appears in both the 24-hour and 10-day battery usage views.

<h2>What Makes a Charger "Slow"?</h2>

<ul>
<br/>
<li>Wired chargers providing 7.5W or less power</li>
<br/>
<li>Standard Qi1 wireless chargers (less than 10W)</li>
