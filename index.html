            Apple on Tuesday seeded a sixth beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, the software designed to run on the Vision Pro headset, and it includes two new tutorial videos shown to the user during the setup process.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WhatsApp is rolling out a new voice chats feature in groups that lets users start voice calls without disturbing everyone in the group.

<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922605" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/whatsapp-voice-chats.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
Previously in WhatsApp group chats, the only option was to start a voice call, which rings every member in the group. If no-one joins, the call doesn't go ahead. 
<br/>
<br/>
In contrast, voice chats can be initiated in a group without anyone joining, and users are prompted to join discreetly via a silent push notification. The feature is available for those WhatsApp groups with 33 to 128 members.
<br/>
<br/>
Group members not participating in the voice chat can see who is active in the call from the chat header and the Calls tab, and people can join or leave at any time. If the encrypted chat remains empty for 60 minutes, it automatically ends.

            Apple today stopped signing iOS 17.1, a move that will prevent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users from downgrading to that version of iOS. Apple is no longer signing iOS 17.1 following the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/apple-releases-ios-17-1-1/">release of iOS 17.1.1</a>, which came out on November 7.

<br/>
It is not unusual that iOS 17.1 is no longer being signed. Apple routinely stops signing older versions of iOS after new releases in order to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date and to prevent users from downgrading to older, less secure versions of the software.
