The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 17e is expected to be a minor upgrade over this year's 16e, launching in early 2026. The main upgrade is likely to be the A19 chip from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, with few other changes expected. It is possible that the device could get the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> and an ‌iPhone‌ 15-style design, but realistically that is likely to occur on a subsequent generation.

            Apple has <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/apple-security-bounty-evolved/">announced</a> a major overhaul of its bug bounty program that doubles the top reward to $2 million for exploit chains that can match the sophistication of mercenary spyware attacks.

With bonuses for Lockdown Mode bypasses and vulnerabilities found in beta software, Apple says its total payouts could exceed $5 million. The company claims this represents "the largest payout offered by any bounty program."

The program now places greater emphasis on complete exploit chains rather than individual vulnerabilities, reflecting the reality that real-world attacks typically chain multiple bugs together. The rewards for remote-entry vectors have also been substantially increased, although categories not comm [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Chinese smartphone maker Vivo has taken some inspiration from Apple's Liquid Glass design language for its latest operating system update, OriginOS 6. Unveiled this week, OriginOS 6 has the same rounded buttons and translucent glass look as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>.

<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
In a demo video, a Vivo smartphone features an interface that could be easily mistaken for ‌iOS 26‌. There's a Liquid Glass clock, Control Center, squircle icons, glass-like rounded buttons, translucent app folders and dock, translucent notifications, and even wallpapers that shift with a 2D to 3D effect like Apple's Spatial Scenes.

<br/>
There is no mistaking the Liquid Glass design influence even though Vivo references water when describing the operating system. "With OriginOS 6, every swipe, scroll, and tap flows like never before. No lags. No stutters. Just effortless motion built for the way you move," reads  [...]<br>

<br/>
The PowerGrip includes a 9,300 mAh battery that can provide a full charge to Apple's iPhones. Included magnets allow it to attach to the back of a MagSafe-compatible <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
It can charge at 7.5W wirelessly, but plugging an ‌iPhone‌ in with the included retractable USB-C cable speeds up charging. With the wireless charging capabilities, the included cable, and an extra USB-C port, up to three devices can be charged at one time. The charger is limited to 15W total, so it's best used to charge an ‌iPhone‌ and smaller devices like an Apple Watch or AirPods.

Pluribus stars Emmy-nominated actress Rhea Seehorn, who also starred in the <em>Breaking Bad</em> spinoff series <em>Better Call Saul</em>. In the "genre-bending" series, Apple says "the most miserable person on Earth must save the world from happiness."

In the teaser video, which is shrouded in mystery, Seehorn plays a woman named Carol. A fictional U.S. government official appears on her TV screen, promising to "figure out" what makes her "different" from the others, so that she can "join" them.

            We're just about due for the next-generation Apple silicon chip, which will kick off a new wave of Mac refreshes. The M5 chip is expected to make an appearance in some new products before the end of the year, but most Mac refreshes will happen in 2026.

            <p>Imagine you have a fabulous idea to drive more sales on Etsy by giving out <em>free ice cream</em> with every purchase. How would you know if it will actually work?</p>
<p>One way to test this out is to run an <strong>experiment</strong>! An experiment is a learning tool that can help us see if a new change really affects user behavior and key metrics we care about. At Etsy, we run nearly 2000 experiments a year for testing new ideas to improve the user experience for our buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>For our ice cream idea, we could set up our experiment as an A/B test on the listing page, where one group of users (the “control” group) sees the usual “Buy it now” button, while the other (the "treatment" group) sees a shiny new version that says, “Buy it now and get a FREE ICE CREAM!”.</p>
