            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's latest iPhone 16 models include a new Camera Control button (located on the lower right-hand side when holding the phone in portrait mode). The new button aims to make it easier to adjust photography settings when shooting with the iPhone in both portrait and landscape orientation.

<br/>
A simple press of the Camera Control button brings up the Camera app when the iPhone is unlocked. Once the Camera app is open, another press takes a picture, while pressing and holding the button records video for as long as you hold it down.

Within the Camera app, a light press on the button engages a haptic click that also allows for adjusting things like manual exposure and zoom, thanks to a handy sliding interface that operates similarly to a camera dial. This gesture also reveals a clean preview of the scene you [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-09-19 04:10:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18, Apple has made a significant enhancement to the Notes app, introducing a built-in audio recording feature that streamlines the process of capturing and transcribing voice notes. The new functionality is available on iPhone 12 and later models, and allows you to record audio directly within a note, eliminating the need to use separate apps or share files.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962314" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-notes-app-voice-recording.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
The new audio recording tool in Notes offers more than just simple voice capture. As users record, the app automatically generates a real-time transcript, making it easier to review and search through recorded content. This feature is particularly useful for students attending lectures, professionals in meetings, or anyone who needs to quickly capture and reference spoken information.

            The European Union today issued a warning to Apple, demanding that the tech giant open up its iOS operating system to rival companies and third-party developers or potentially face significant fines. The move is part of the EU's efforts to enforce the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to ensure fair competition in the digital marketplace.

So, it was <a href="https://www.tanzutalk.com/e/purnima-career/">fun to talk with her</a> about the history of all of that - something I've been involved in and equally curious about these past 20+ years. We also discuss the differences between startups and large companies - most interestingly Purnima’s take on what large companies can learn from how startups operate. <a href="https://www.tanzutalk.com/e/purnima-career/">Listen to it here</a>, it's was a fun interview</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" href="https://www.tanzutalk.com/e/purnima-career/" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset">&lt;source typ</div></a></figure></div> [...]<br>
