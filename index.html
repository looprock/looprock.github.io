            On iPhone 15 models, iOS 18 will recommend that users set a particular charging limit for their device based on their recent usage habits, with the aim of potentially improving their iPhone battery's lifespan by reducing the time that the battery is fully charged.

<br/>
All four iPhone 15 models feature a setting that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-15-battery-charging-limit/">prevents the devices from charging beyond 80%</a> while toggled on, and iOS 18 expands the feature by adding <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-introduces-more-charging-limits/">new 85%, 90%, and 95% charging limit options</a>. With the new limit options, iOS 18 now takes a proactive approach to improving battery longevity by recommending a specific charging limit to users via a notification.

Safari's headline feature in macOS 15 is something called Highlights, which aims to make it easier to discover information on the web.

Highlights can be accessed via a new site menu icon that appears in the address bar, from which you can quickly pull up relevant information about a site, such as directions, summaries, or quick links to learn more about people, music, movies, and TV shows.

Unlike the other color swatches, the multicolor option does not currently apply to widgets and the date, which turn white when the rainbow effect is applied. However, there's a good chance this is something Apple intends to implement but has not yet got around to doing so in the developer beta.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-06-12 04:21:43-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, Apple has introduced a new window tiling management feature that aims to make it easy to arrange open windows into a layout that works best for you. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955093" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macos-15-tiling.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
PC users have had tiling since at least Windows 7 and Aero Snap, and if you've ever used those, the new window tiling feature in ‌macOS Sequoia‌ will be familiar. In the absence of the feature, Mac users have relied on several third-party tools like Magnet, Moom, and Rectangle to achieve similar results, but as things stand, in beta 1, window management in macOS still needs some work before it can approach the utility of those apps.

            Apple updated the Battery section of the Settings app in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> to add a feature that lets you know if you charged your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> with a "slow" charger.

Periods of slow charging are shown with an orange bar in the portion of the Battery settings that show battery usage and charging over the past 24 hours or the past 10 days.
