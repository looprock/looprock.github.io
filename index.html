<br/>
In a <a href="https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1780646505164239364">post shared today</a> on social media platform X, oft-accurate display industry expert Ross Young said he heard that the "iPhone 17 Plus" will be equipped with a smaller screen than the current-generation iPhone 15 Plus, which has a 6.7-inch display. However, he did not reveal the exact screen size planned for the iPhone 17 Plus.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently, the iPhone 15 Plus has the same screen size as the iPhone 15 Pro Max. If this rumor is accurate, a smaller screen would further differentiate the Plus model from the Pro Max model, starting with the iPhone 17 lineup.

            Apple today released the second beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 1.2 update to developers, allowing them to test new features ahead of the software seeing a public launch. The second ‌visionOS‌ 1.2 beta comes two weeks after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/apple-seeds-visionos-1-2-beta-1-to-developers/">release the first beta</a>.

<br/>
The ‌visionOS‌ beta can be downloaded by going to the Settings app on the device and toggling on developer betas. A registered developer account is required, and Apple recommends making a backup before installing new software.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple may make further improvements to Personas, EyeSight, and other features with ‌visionOS‌ 1.2, but no major new additions were found in the first beta.&lt;d [...]<br>

            <p>When I look at recent platform engineering surveys, the results are positive: people see the value in platforms and platform groups. I’d say this is because platforms are helping speed up the app release cycle by automating a lot of the infrastructure work app developers would otherwise need to do, baking in/automating security and compliance, and, to a lesser extent, standardizing how apps are built, run, managed, and optimized.</p><p>Here’s my notes on one of those surveys, <a href="https://www.puppet.com/success/resources/state-of-platform-engineering?utm_source=cote&amp;utm_campaign=devrel&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_content=newsletter20240416">the one from Perforce/Puppet</a>.

<p id="Sbv6ZD">On the afternoon of March 11th, 2011, Mitsuyoshi Hirai, the chief engineer of the cable maintenance ship Ocean Link,<em> </em>was sitting in his cabin 20 miles off Japan’s eastern coast, completing the paperwork that comes at the end of every repair. Two weeks earlier, something — you rarely knew what — damaged the 13,000-mile fiber optic cable connecting Kitaibaraki, Japan, and Point Arena, California. Alarms went off; calls were made; and the next day, Hirai was sailing out of the port in Yokohama to fix it.</p>
