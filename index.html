            <b>Published:</b> 2023-11-08 03:58:31-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Google and European telecom groups have urged EU regulators to designate iMessage a "core" service that would force Apple to make the communications platform interoperable with competing chat services, reports the <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ec2ec699-a91c-4389-b1a9-ae06dca836d5">Financial Times</a></em>.

<br/>
In a letter sent to the European Commission, the EU's executive body, the signatories including Google and some of Europe's largest telecoms operators claimed that Apple's service meets the qualitative thresholds of the act, and should therefore be captured by the rules to "benefit European consumers and businesses."
<br/>

The "fundamental nature" of iMessage as "an important gateway between business users and their customers is without doubt justification for Apple’s designation as gatekeeper for its i [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Following the unveiling of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-m3-macbook-pros/">new MacBook Pro models last week</a>, Apple surprised some with the introduction of a base 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 chip, which replaced the discontinued M2 13-inch MacBook Pro in Apple's Mac lineup.

<br/>
Starting at $1,599, the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro comes with 8GB of unified memory. That makes it $300 more expensive than the $1,299 starting price of the now-discontinued ‌M2‌ 13-inch MacBook Pro with 8GB. Users can opt for 16GB or 24GB at checkout, but these configuration options cost an extra $200 and $400 at purchase, respectively, and cannot be upgraded at a later date because of Apple's unified memory architecture.
