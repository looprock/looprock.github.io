            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-21 08:01:04-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has confirmed that its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-unveils-c1/">custom-designed C1 modem</a> in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-announces-iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a> has nothing to do with the device's lack of MagSafe support, <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2614585/iphone-16e-without-magsafe-apple-modem-c1-is-the-reason.html">according to <em>Macworld</em></a>.

<br/>
Following the launch of the iPhone 16e, there was some speculation online about how MagSafe magnets might have interfered with the C1 modem's cellular connectivity performance, and this was considered to be a potential reason for the device not supporting MagSafe. But, that explanation is not true, according to Apple.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-21 07:17:34-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has withdrawn its Advanced Data Protection iCloud feature from the United Kingdom following government demands for backdoor access to encrypted user data, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/apple-removes-end-to-end-encryption-feature-from-uk-after-backdoor-order"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. The move comes after UK officials secretly ordered Apple to provide unrestricted access to encrypted iCloud content worldwide.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Customers who are already using Advanced Data Protection, or ADP, will need to manually disable it during an unspecified grace period to keep their iCloud accounts, according to the report. Apple said it will issue additional guidance in the future to affected users and that it "does not have the ability to automatically disable it on their behalf."

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-21 06:58:52-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Earlier this week, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said all four iPhone 17 models will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/kuo-iphone-17-models-apple-designed-wi-fi-7-chip/">equipped with Apple's first-ever custom-designed Wi-Fi chip</a>. He did not say which Wi-Fi version the chip will support, but it appears that it will be Wi-Fi 7.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-883034" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/Apple-Wi-Fi-Chip-Feature-Triad.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
All four iPhone 17 models will feature an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip, according to Jeff Pu, an analyst who covers companies within Apple's supply chain. He shared this information in a research note with GF Securities earlier this month.
<br/>
<br/>
The entire iPhone 16 lineup already supports Wi-Fi 7, so this is not much of a surprise, but the fact that the chip will be designed by Apple is notable. Apple recently debuted its &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/2 [...]<br>

            Apple plans to move away from Qualcomm modems in the Apple Watch while bolstering its new in-house alternatives, according to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-versus-qualcomm-a-split-looms-for-techs-rockiest-marriage"><em>The Information</em></a>'s Wayne Ma.

<br/>
Later this year, Apple plans to eliminate the Qualcomm modem used in the Apple Watch Ultra. Rather than using the C1 modem or another custom Apple chip, Apple plans to switch from using Qualcomm units to MediaTek ones. MediaTek is one of the few companies capable of designing 5G modems.
<br/>
<br/>
In 2026, Apple will debut a new custom modem with support for mmWave 5G. The C1 does not have this capability. The modem with mmWave support will be used in iPhones and "at least one <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>." T [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is already testing its second-generation C2 modem for future iPhone models, according to a leaker with a proven track record.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
A private account on X with a history of sharing accurate information said the C2 modem has a C4020 identifier within Apple, which seems to confirm that it already exists. However, the leaker did not provide any further details.
<br/>
<br/>
The leaker has requested that we not link to their private account in our coverage of their posts.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple has publicly confirmed that it starts developing new iPhone chips several years in advance of them launching, so it is not surprising that the company is allegedly working on a C2 modem. Apple's second-generation modem should offer faster and more reliable 5G connectivity, and it could be even more power efficient.

            Apple's rumored "iPhone 17 Air" model could feature a larger display than originally expected.

<br/>
On the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/recycle-bin/id1370912440">Recycle Bin podcast this week</a>, Jon Prosser said the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a 6.7-inch display, rather than a 6.6-inch display as previously rumored.
<br/>
<br/>
Last year, display industry analyst Ross Young said the iPhone 17 Air <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/">would have a 6.55-inch display</a>, or a 6.6-inch display when rounded up.
<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear which rumored measurement is accurate: 6.6 inches or 6.7 inches.

Prosser also claimed that the iPhone 17 Air will be 5.64mm thick, at least when excluding the device's &lt;a href="https://ww [...]<br>

iOS 18.2 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/apple-announces-airtag-location-sharing/">added a new feature to the Find My app</a> that allows you to temporarily share the location of an AirTag-equipped item with others, including employees at participating airlines. This way, if you have put AirTags inside your bags, the airline can better help you find them in the event they are lost or delayed at the airport.

            The new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-announces-iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a> has the longest battery life of any 6.1-inch iPhone. According to Apple's tech specs, the iPhone 16e offers up to 26 hours of battery life for video playback, compared to up to 22 hours for the standard iPhone 16.

A key reason the iPhone 16e has longer battery life than the iPhone 16 is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-unveils-c1/">Apple's new C1 modem</a>, which is the most power-efficient modem ever included in an iPhone. All other current iPhone models are equipped with Qualcomm modems.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-20 08:55:10-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Oppo has launched the <a href="https://www.oppo.com/en/smartphones/series-find-n/find-n5/">Find N5</a>, the world's thinnest foldable phone yet. When closed, the book-style foldable measures 8.93mm. That's less than a millimeter thicker than an iPhone 16 Pro, and thinner than the Honor Magic V3, which was the previous record holder.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-989071" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/oppo-find-n5-fingers.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
The device is barely thicker than its USB-C port. Indeed, Oppo has suggested that the obstacle to making it any thinner is now "the limit of the charging port." It's already thinner than a headphone jack, which is probably why there isn't one.
<br/>
<br/>
When opened, the Find N5 is 4.21mm at its thinnest point, which is actually thicker than the new <a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/en/phones/mate-xt-ultimate-design/">Huawei Mate XT Ultimate</a> tri-fold phone at 3.66mm – so the "world's [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple will use its own custom-designed Wi-Fi chip in all upcoming iPhone 17 models, according to industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-883034" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/Apple-Wi-Fi-Chip-Feature-Triad.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Writing in a <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1892605046078259711">post on X</a> (Twitter), Kuo said the switch to in-house Wi-Fi chips will "enhance connectivity across Apple devices" while also giving Apple a cost reduction.
<br/>
<br/>
All current iPhone models are equipped with a combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip supplied by Broadcom, but Kuo has previously said he expects Apple to equip "nearly all" of its products with its own in-house Wi-Fi chip "within about three years."
