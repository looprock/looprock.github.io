            This week we’re talking to Andreas Kling about SerenityOS and Ladybird. Andreas started SerenityOS as a means of therapy. It’s self-described as a love letter to “‘90s user interfaces with a custom Unix-like core.” Andreas previously worked at Nokia and later at Apple on the WebKit team, so he had an itch to do something along the lines of a browser, and that’s where Ladybird came from. We get into the details of compilers, OSs, browsers, web specifications, and the love of making software.<br>

Back in July, we teamed up with Unknownz21 to reveal a new dark blue shade that Apple plans to use for the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌, and at that time, we also said that Apple has been testing a silver-gray shade and a space black color. <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/08/24/iphone-15-pro-titanium-no-gold/">9to5Mac</a></em> today said that it has also heard that Apple will be introducing a new dark blue color, which will be joined by silver, space black, and a natural titanium shade.

According to Astropad, Rock Paper Pencil is meant to have "unmatched realism" thanks to the combination of the custom ‌Apple Pencil‌ tip and screen protector engineered to match.

It snaps onto an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and can be removed when not needed for writing purposes.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-08-24 16:21:51+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>\
In the last article, I wrote about thinking errors that are the biggest cause of leadership ineffectiveness. When leaders don’t pay attention to how they think and make decisions and the impact it has on the organization and its people, their actions—however well intended they may be—cease to produce the desired effect.</p>
<p>\
Making good decisions isn’t just about making the right choices; it’s also about being able to recognize and eliminate bad ones.</p>
<p>\
Here are the other four thinking traps that add to leadership ineffectiveness:</p>

<li>Goodhart’s law</li>
<li>Black-and-white thinking</li>
<li>Cobra effect</li>
<li>Intuition alone</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="goodhartslaw">Goodhart’s law</h2>
<p>Goodhart’s law states, “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” In other words, when you start measuring people on specific end objectives, they will only optimize for that objective and try to achieve the outcome at all costs without considering the consequences.</p>
