So, is it worth the savings? <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera spent a week with the ‌iPhone 16e‌ as his main <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to see what he could live without.

            OpenAI has updated the <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt/download/">ChatGPT app for macOS</a> with the ability to directly edit code in popular development environments including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains tools.

<br/>
The new feature allows the AI chatbot to make changes to code without requiring users to copy and paste between applications. ChatGPT can now read code from these environments and make edits directly within them.
<br/>
<br/>
An optional "auto-apply" mode enables ChatGPT to implement changes without additional clicks. Alexander Embiricos, a member of OpenAI's product team, <a href="https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1897700857833193955">shared a demonstration of the feature</a> on social media and noted that the capability will come to Windows "soon."

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has increased the thickness of the upcoming iPhone 17 Pro Max compared to the current generation iPhone 16 Pro Max, claims the Chinese leaker known as <a href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/PhqFQjY5b">Ice Universe</a>.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple is said to have increased the depth of the iPhone 17 Pro Max to 8.725mm, up from 8.25mm on the iPhone 16 Pro Max, which would be a 0.475mm difference in thickness. The increase "surely means a larger battery," according to the leaker. Apart from depth, the iPhone 17 Pro Max's frame reportedly <a href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/PhqQrs9PB">remains unchanged</a>, and is otherwise identical to the iPhone 16 Pro Max.

            Apple's all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air shares the same dimensions as the iPhone 17 Pro Max, with the only difference being in the thickness of the devices, according to the leaker Ice Universe.

Posting to their <a href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/PhqSED0hS">Weibo account</a>, the Chinese leaker today claimed that the iPhone 17 Air and iPhone 17 Pro Max have identical body length, width, screen size, and bezels.

If these dimension are accurate, they also suggest that the iPhone 17 Pro Max will itself be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/iphone-17-pro-max-thicker-larger-battery/">substantially thicker</a> than the existing iPhone 16 Pro M [...]<br>
