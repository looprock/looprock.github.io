            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple plans to launch its next-generation Vision headsets as early as 2026, and they will likely be more affordable, <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20241219-12419.html">according to TrendForce</a>.

<br/>
In line with previous rumors, the Taiwanese research firm today said Apple is planning to introduce both a next-generation Vision Pro and a mainstream headset, which would likely be named "Apple Vision" without the "Pro" modifier.
<br/>
<br/>
For the next-generation Vision Pro, TrendForce said Apple will likely consider sourcing components from suppliers beyond Sony to reduce production costs, and this move could contribute to the headset having a lower price. Currently, the Vision Pro starts at $3,499 in the U.S., and this price has naturally limited sales of the device [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has stopped signing iOS 18.1.1, preventing iPhone users who have upgraded to iOS 18.2 from downgrading to that version of iOS. Apple released iOS 18.2 a week ago on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/apple-releases-ios-18-2-update/">December 11</a>.

<br/>
Apple often stops signing an older version of iOS, usually within a week or two after a new version is released. When an update is no longer signed, it can't be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side software verification check.
<br/>
<br/>
This policy encourages users to keep their operating systems up to date, ensuring they have the latest security enhancements. Apple also stopped signing iOS 17.7.2 on Wednesday.

Priced at $20, TimeCapsule is an ‌AirTag‌ enclosure that houses two AA batteries that offer 14x more battery capacity than the CR2032 battery that the ‌AirTag‌ runs on. It works by attaching the ‌AirTag‌'s upper housing to the built-in custom contact in the TimeCapsule, which provides power instead of the coin cell battery.
