            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Ahead of 2026 and associated New Year's resolutions, Apple has started sharing new social media ads focused on the Apple Watch as a motivational tool.
<br/>
<br/>
In a series of "quit quitting" spots, Apple Watch owners run away from a bed, a recliner, and a bar stool. Each spot includes a glimpse of the Apple Watch Workout app and messages that the device provides while running. The Apple Watch is able to provide updates on pace and activity segment, as well as alerts when activity rings are closed.

            Apple is rumored to be introducing a foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> in September 2026, and since it will bring the biggest form factor change since the ‌iPhone‌ was introduced in 2007, curiosity about the design is high. A 3D designer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/23/have-a-3d-printer-you-can-make-your-own-iphone-fold-dummy/">created an iPhone Fold design</a> based on rumors, and we printed it out to see how it compares to Apple's current iPhones.

The foldable ‌iPhone‌ is going to be smaller than any current ‌iPhone‌ when it's closed, and it'll be shorter than Samsung's Galaxy foldables. Rumors suggest it'll be somewhere around 5.4 inches, which would make it as small as the now-discontinued ‌iPhone‌ 13 mini.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple now has additional time to allow for tariffs on Chinese semiconductors, thanks to a delay on any actual cost impact until June 2027.

<br/>
While the United States will still apply new tariffs on semiconductor imports from China, the effective tariff rate will be set at zero for approximately 18 months, according to a Federal Register <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-23912.pdf">filing</a> (via <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/23/us-china-chip-tariffs.html">CNBC</a></em>).

The images, shared by the Apple leaker and prototype collector known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a>," claim to show first-generation AirPods prototypes with pink and yellow exterior casings.

They seem close to some of the color options offered for the ‌iPhone‌ 5c, which came in blue, green, pink, yellow and white. Apple has only ever released AirPods in white.

<blockquote>
<p>The choice of where and how to start your AI journey is a business decision, not a technology one. By grounding your AI efforts in the operational muscle you’ve already built with Java and Spring, you minimize friction and risk. Everyone just keeps doing what they’re doing, but with a new tool. This established operational and development life is the hard-won experience, paid for in decades of maintenance and gut-wrenching production failures, that gives you the platform to continuously absorb new capabilities like Spring AI and MCP.</p>
<p>Get the developer experience and the operator experience right, and you unlock the organizational velocity needed to turn tentative AI experiments into a mission-critical competitive advantage.</p>
