In a post this week, the leaker said the A19 Pro chip will have a 6-core GPU in the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max, but only a 5-core GPU in the iPhone 17 Air.

<br/>
The streaming service's website and mobile apps now display the HBO Max branding once again. Max.com redirects to <a href="https://www.hbomax.com">hbomax.com</a>, while both the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hbo-max-stream-movies-tv/id1666653815">Apple App Store</a> and Google Play Store have updated their listings. Users won't need to download a new app, as existing installations will automatically update to show the HBO Max name.

The App Store update includes a cheeky note: "Same app. New-ish name. The plot twist everyone has been waiting for: Max is now HBO Max."
