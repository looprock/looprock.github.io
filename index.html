            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's launch of the iPhone 15 series could be delayed by a "few weeks," pushing the debut of the company's next-generation smartphone lineup beyond its usual September timeframe, according to Wamsi Mohan, a global securities analyst at Bank of America.

<br/>
Mohan shared his prediction in a research note obtained by <em><a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/apple-earnings-iphone-sales-delay-47247f90">Barrons</a></em> after conducting channel checks in Apple's supply chain. Mohan said the launch looked like it could slip into the fourth quarter, which runs through October to December, and he was concerned that guidance for the third quarter could disappoint Wall Street analysts as a result of the possible delay.

<br/>
Mohan now sees September quarter revenue of $87.1 billion, well below consensus at $91. [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Angular developers often find it difficult to integrate a phone number input field.

You would not find any input field that can accept user data in the phone number format and validate the same. Therefore, you have to custom-make the form control for the phone number field and then embed intl-tel-input, synchronizing the entire operations.

Here, I have proposed a solution to create a custom form control for the phone number input field using intl-tel-input that supports mat-form-field in Angular.<br>

            Netflix today quietly eliminated its most <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926">affordable ad-free plan</a> in the United States and the United Kingdom, raising the price of ad-free streaming options.

<br/>
In the U.S., the Basic plan was priced at $9.99 per month, and with its removal, ad-free streaming now starts at $15.49 per month. Netflix subscribers can opt for the $6.99 per month "Standard with ads" plan, but that price point includes advertisements.
<br/>
<br/>
New customers who want an ad-free streaming experience will now need to pay $5.50 more without the Basic plan. As noted by <em><a href="https://www.cordbusters.co.uk/netflix-pricing-basic-tier-axed-uk-us/">Cord Busters</a></em>, this shift will put more focus on Netflix's ad-supported plan, and it is a move that the company already teste [...]<br>
