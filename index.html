In December, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/08/sony-vr2-controllers-apple-vision-pro-support/">Gurman said</a> that the partnership has been in development for several months and would introduce Sony's VR controllers as an optional accessory for Vision Pro users. He noted that PS5 and Xbox controllers are already supported by Vision Pro, but they aren't optimized for virtual reality experiences, lacking the six degrees of freedom (6DOF) needed for precise VR gaming controls.

Open source models like Llama, R1 from DeepSeek, etc have all contributed to this. It’s become even more clear the model calls themselves are commoditizing quickly. And this is great! If the variable ‘COGS’ component of marginal API call approaches zero, many of the questions listed above start to go away.
