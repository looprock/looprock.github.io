            This year, Apple tweaked iPhone 16 Pro screen sizes to make them bigger than 2023's iPhone 15 Pro models, and next year we are also expecting a change in the size of the displays in the iPhone 17 lineup. Here's what we know.

<h2>Standard iPhone 17</h2>
<br/>
Apple could introduce a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/22/iphone-17-lineup-specs-detail-upgrades/">new display size</a> for the standard iPhone 17 model in 2025. The iPhone 17 could measure in at 6.3 inches, up from 6.1 inches, which would make it the same size as the current iPhone 16 Pro. At 6.3 inches, it would be in between the size of the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 and the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus. However, next year there may be only one non-Pro model in Apple's lineup (see below).

            Apple plans to release a new "HomePod" with a 7-inch LCD display, an A18 chip, and Apple Intelligence support in 2025, according <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20241216PD218/apple-supply-chain-display-lcd-boe.html">to <em>DigiTimes</em></a>.

It is unclear how much the screen-equipped HomePod would cost, but Apple is seemingly aiming for a reasonable price. In a paywalled report this week, the supply chain publication said Apple has selected China-based manufacturer Tianma to supply the LCD panels for the device, at an "exceptionally competitive" price of $10 per panel. The low cost of this component would likely contribute to the device being more affordable.

A screen-equipped HomePod has been rumored several times over the past few years. Ea [...]<br>
