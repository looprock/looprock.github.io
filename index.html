According to Geekbench 6 Metal benchmark results spotted by <em><a href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/mobiles/mobiles-news/iphone-16e-geekbench-8gb-ram/">MySmartPrice</a></em>, the iPhone 16e scored 24,188 points in graphics testing, which is around 15% lower than the more expensive iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus. This performance difference is likely due to Apple's use of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-announces-iphone-16e/">chip-binned A18 chip</a>.

We've been hearing rumors about an iPhone that folds in half for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/10/11/apple-lg-foldable-iphone/">over eight years now</a>. While they have lacked consistency, they do suggest that Apple has tested various prototypes, with the hinge seemingly the biggest challenge Apple has been trying to overcome. Apple wants to eliminate any crease in the screen before bringing a device to market.

<br/>
A private account on X with a history of sharing accurate information said the C2 modem has a C4020 identifier within Apple, which seems to confirm that it already exists. However, the leaker did not provide any further details.

<br/>
The leaker has requested that we not link to their private account in our coverage of their posts.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple has publicly confirmed that it starts developing new iPhone chips several years in advance of them launching, so it is not surprising that the company is allegedly working on a C2 modem. Apple's second-generation modem should offer faster and more reliable 5G connectivity, and it could be even more power efficient.

            Apple's rumored "iPhone 17 Air" model could feature a larger display than originally expected.

<br/>
On the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/recycle-bin/id1370912440">Recycle Bin podcast this week</a>, Jon Prosser said the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a 6.7-inch display, rather than a 6.6-inch display as previously rumored.
<br/>
<br/>
Last year, display industry analyst Ross Young said the iPhone 17 Air <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/">would have a 6.55-inch display</a>, or a 6.6-inch display when rounded up.
<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear which rumored measurement is accurate: 6.6 inches or 6.7 inches.

            The new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-announces-iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a> has the longest battery life of any 6.1-inch iPhone. According to Apple's tech specs, the iPhone 16e offers up to 26 hours of battery life for video playback, compared to up to 22 hours for the standard iPhone 16.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Oppo has launched the <a href="https://www.oppo.com/en/smartphones/series-find-n/find-n5/">Find N5</a>, the world's thinnest foldable phone yet. When closed, the book-style foldable measures 8.93mm. That's less than a millimeter thicker than an iPhone 16 Pro, and thinner than the Honor Magic V3, which was the previous record holder.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-989071" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/oppo-find-n5-fingers.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
The device is barely thicker than its USB-C port. Indeed, Oppo has suggested that the obstacle to making it any thinner is now "the limit of the charging port." It's already thinner than a headphone jack, which is probably why there isn't one.
<br/>
<br/>
When opened, the Find N5 is 4.21mm at its thinnest point, which is actually thicker than the new <a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/en/phones/mate-xt-ultimate-design/">Huawei Mate XT Ultimate</a> tri-fold phone at 3.66mm – so the "world's [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple will use its own custom-designed Wi-Fi chip in all upcoming iPhone 17 models, according to industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-883034" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/Apple-Wi-Fi-Chip-Feature-Triad.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Writing in a <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1892605046078259711">post on X</a> (Twitter), Kuo said the switch to in-house Wi-Fi chips will "enhance connectivity across Apple devices" while also giving Apple a cost reduction.
<br/>
<br/>
All current iPhone models are equipped with a combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip supplied by Broadcom, but Kuo has previously said he expects Apple to equip "nearly all" of its products with its own in-house Wi-Fi chip "within about three years." 
<br/>
<br/>
Kuo in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/31/kuo-iphone-17-apple-wi-fi-7-chip/">October</a> predicted that at least one iPhone 17 model launching next year will be equipped wi [...]<br>

There are three product categories that we are definitely expecting to get upgraded before spring has ended. Keep reading to learn what they are. If we're lucky, Apple might make a surprise announcement about a completely new product category.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-20 03:28:34-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's first custom-designed modem chip, the C1, has finally made its debut in the iPhone 16e, which Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-announces-iphone-16e/">announced</a> on Wednesday. It's a significant milestone in the company's efforts to reduce reliance on external suppliers like Qualcomm. However, the C1 lacks support for ultra-fast mmWave 5G technology, and the chip's limitations are expected to extend to the upcoming ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air.

<br/>
While touted by Apple as their most power-efficient cellular chip to date, the C1 modem currently supports only sub-6GHz 5G networks. This means users won't have access to the exceptionally fast speeds that mmWave technology can provide in specific locations such as stadiums, airports, and dense urban areas.

            Apple's unveiling on Wednesday of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-announces-iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a>, which replaced the iPhone SE line, marked a strategic shift in the company's flagship smartphone lineup. Starting at $599, the iPhone 16e offers a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, an A18 chip, and a USB-C port, positioning it as a more affordable alternative within the iPhone 16 family. Does that mean we should expect an iPhone 17e to be added to the upcoming iPhone 17 series?

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple never publicly advertises the amount of RAM included in iPhones, but <em>MacRumors</em> has confirmed that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a> is equipped with 8GB of RAM.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Given the iPhone 16e supports Apple Intelligence, it was widely expected that the device would have 8GB of RAM, as that is the minimum amount of memory required for Apple Intelligence. All other iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models also have 8GB of RAM, while the iPhone SE that was replaced by the iPhone 16e is equipped with 4GB of RAM.

Apple no longer manufactures any iPhones with a Lightning port, and all models in the ‌iPhone‌ lineup feature USB-C. Apple does still sell refurbished iPhones that use Lightning, but its main website and retail locations only offer iPhones with USB-C connectivity.
