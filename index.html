            Apple is working on a new version of the 4K <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, and rumors suggest that it could launch as soon as 2024, two years after the launch of the current model. This guide includes details on everything that we expect to see in the 2024 ‌Apple TV‌ 4K.

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<br/>
Apple has not notably changed the design of the ‌Apple TV‌ in several years, and that's not going to change in 2024. We are not expecting any updates to the form factor, and it will continue to use the same slimmed-down black plastic body from the current ‌Apple TV‌ model.
