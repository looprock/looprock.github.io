            Google has issued a critical security update for Chrome on macOS, Windows, and Linux that fixes a zero-day vulnerability in the browser. On Tuesday, Google in a Chrome <a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2023/11/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_28.html">stable channel update</a> said it "is aware that an exploit for <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-6345">CVE-2023-6345</a> exists in the wild."

            Meta intends to launch Threads in the European Union next month, according to a report by <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/meta-threads-europe-launch-98448df5">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>.

<br/>
The social media network debuted in most markets in July, but did not launch in the EU because Meta was unsure whether it would be able to adhere to the bloc's stringent regulations for online services. Threads can import data from Instagram, including behavioral and advertising information.

<br/>
According to sources who spoke to <em>WSJ</em>, Meta will comply with the regulations by giving EU users a choice of using Threads purely for consumption, without a profile that allows them to make their own posts.
