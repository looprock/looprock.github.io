            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            For the first time in the standard AirPods range, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a> offer optional active noise cancellation (ANC) for an additional $50, providing a quieter and more immersive listening experience, especially in noisy environments.
<br/>

<br/>
Key upgrades of the ‌AirPods 4‌ include a more comfortable fit, improved sound quality with a new low-distortion driver, and enhanced features like Personalized Spatial Audio. Beyond active noise cancellation, there are a handful of additional features that differentiate the two ‌AirPods 4‌ models. This buyer's guide breaks down all of the differences between the two variants and helps you to decide which best fits your needs.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-10-02 08:33:47-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Best Buy might offer an unspecified iPad mini model on clearance "soon," according to a <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-computer-inc-9555093/9555093.p?skuId=9555093">product listing</a> that was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1fuh98z/ipad_mini_clearance_coming_soon/">spotted</a> on the retailer's website.

<br/>
The placeholder listing is for an Apple product with a "MINI WIFI" model name, and it is in the "tablets" section on Best Buy's online store. Altogether, this strongly suggests that the listing will be for an iPad mini. The device will apparently be available for a clearance price of $359.99 in the U.S., down from a regular price of $599. However, the iPad mini currently starts at $499, so the listing appears to have a pricing error.

            Well-known electronics repair website iFixit today shared an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sF0BOpbyjY">AirPods 4 teardown video</a> that offers a look inside Apple's latest wireless earbuds. Specifically, these are the entry-level <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4-vs-previous-generations/">AirPods 4</a> without active noise cancellation (ANC).

<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Unsurprisingly, iFixit said AirPods remain a "nightmare to take apart," with the earbuds earning a lowest-possible 0/10 score on iFixit's reparability scale.
<br/>
<br/>
The teardown does not reveal any major internal differences between the AirPods 3 and AirPods 4.
<br/>
<br/>
The charging case for the AirPods 4 without ANC is equipped with a 345 mAh battery. This is the same size battery as in the AirPods 3 charging case.

            <h4>The Two Billion Claps Bug</h4><h3>TL;DR</h3><p>A user was able to exploit a race condition in our backend system to manipulate clap counts on posts. Users are supposed to only be able to clap between 0 and 50 times for a given post, but this hack allowed them to go outside those bounds (both above and below). Our fix leverages <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.ConditionExpressions.html">DynamoDB condition expressions</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadConsistency.html">strongly consistent reads</a> to block updates on data that have been manipulated after a read, but before a write. Additionally, we implemented an eventually consistent clap rectification solution for those posts that were already affected by this bug.</p><h3>Catching The Bug</h3><p>We became aware of this problem thanks to a user who brought an extremely detailed writeup of a roundabout way to manipulate claps.

            <p>We recently spent a sprint focused on reducing our Snowflake costs. During this sprint, we investigated 22 of our most expensive pipelines (in terms of Snowflake costs), one by one. In total we merged 56 changes, and in this post we’ll be laying out the optimisations that worked best for us.</p><p>Most of these changes were just common sense and didn’t involve any advanced data engineering techniques.

Our team has inherited a tech stack that has a long history, some flaws and technical debt. Our approach to this problem was pragmatic; we’re not trying to suggest big pipeline re-designs to reach a perfect state, but rather consider our tech stack in it’s current state and figure out the best options to cut costs quickly. Our product evolves, and as we create new things we can remove some old ones, which is why we don’t need</blockquote> [...]<br>
