All current Macs use SSDs.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-05 08:50:16-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, currently in beta, Apple offers a new Adaptive Power Mode that works alongside the existing Low Power Mode to intelligently extend your iPhone's battery life. Unlike Low Power Mode's heavy restrictions, this AI-powered feature makes subtle adjustments that you're barely meant to notice. Here's how it works.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-971681" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/iPhone-16-Battery-Life-Feature.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
<h2>What Adaptive Power Mode Does</h2>
<br/>
When your battery usage runs higher than usual, Adaptive Power Mode automatically makes small performance tweaks to help your iPhone last longer. Apple says this includes slightly dimming the display brightness or allowing some tasks to "take a little longer" to complete.
<br/>
<br/>
The feature works in the background without the limitations of Low Power Mode, although the latter may still be activated if your device depletes to a 20% charge level.

<br/>
According to <em><a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-25-22-13-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a></em>, the latest WhatsApp beta for Android contains references to so-called "guest chats," which lets users send a link to an online chat, where the "guest" doesn't have to have an app on their device or even need to be in possession of a WhatsApp account.
<br/>
<br/>
To kick off a guest chat, the WhatsApp user has to invite someone from their contacts who doesn't have the app installed and share a chat link. When the recipient opens the link, they're granted access to an online end-to-end encrypted chat with the sender – likely via an interface similar to WhatsApp Web.

According to a source familiar with the company's plans, Apple is highly likely to replace the current ‌Apple TV‌ 4K with a new model later this year. The current model will be discontinued.

Today's ‌Apple TV‌ 4K came out in 2022, featuring the A15 Bionic chip, support for HDR10+, and a tweaked <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> Remote with a USB-C port for charging. Apple does not refresh the ‌Apple TV‌'s hardware frequently, releasing a new model around every three years. This 2022 model is the newest and only ‌Apple TV‌ in the company's product lineup.

            Apple's iPhone 17 event this year appears to be scheduled for Tuesday, September 9, according to internal information from German mobile phone providers, as reported by <em><a href="https://www.iphone-ticker.de/iphone-17-vorstellung-wohl-am-9-verkaufsstart-am-19-september-261445/">iphone-ticker.de</a></em>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Despite being over two years old, Apple's AirPods Pro 2 still dominate the premium wireless‑earbud space, thanks to a potent mix of top‑tier audio, class‑leading noise cancellation, and Apple's habit of delivering major new features through software updates. Rumors suggest AirPods Pro 3 could arrive as soon as September 2025 alongside the iPhone 17 lineup, giving prospective AirPods buyers a dilemma: snap up the proven AirPods Pro 2 at today's prices, or hold off for the next‑generation model that could raise the bar once again?

            Well, well, well. The “age assurance” part of the UK&#8217;s Online Safety Act has finally gone into effect, with its age checking requirements kicking in a week and a half ago. And what do you know? It&#8217;s turned out to be exactly the privacy-invading, freedom-crushing, technically unworkable disaster that everyone with half a brain predicted [&#8230;]<br>

Starting today, ChatGPT will provide users with "gentle reminders" about how long they've been using the service, with suggestions for breaks. OpenAI says that it isn't measuring success by time spent on ChatGPT, but by ensuring that people leave the product after finishing what they came for.
