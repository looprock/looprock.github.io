            Valve this week released <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, the highly anticipated free upgrade for owners of <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>, but Mac owners were left in the lurch on launch day, with the upgrade breaking the game and seemingly no macOS version forthcoming.

Some users have had to employ a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/730/discussions/0/3881596897258134490/">workaround</a> to reverse the change and access <em>CS:GO</em>, but it's less than ideal.
