            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the launch of the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4/">AirPods 4</a>, Apple discontinued the low-cost AirPods 2 and AirPods 3, making the AirPods lineup much less confusing. The ‌AirPods 4‌ come in two variants, one with Active Noise Cancellation and one without, allowing Apple to hit two separate price points.

<br/>
The ‌AirPods 4‌ without Active Noise Cancellation are priced at $129, which is the same price that Apple used to sell the AirPods 2 for. The ANC version is priced at $179, the same cost as the prior-generation AirPods 3.

There wasn't notable difference between the AirPods 2 and AirPods 3 in terms of core functionality, which was undoubtedly confusing to the average consumer not familiar with Apple's products. The new lineup makes it very clear what's what [...]<br>
