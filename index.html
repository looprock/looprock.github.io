            With the fourth-generation AirPods, Apple has eliminated the Setup Button located on the back of the Charging Case in other AirPods models. Rather than using a physical button, Apple has instead opted for a hidden capacitive button.

The hidden button for pairing and resetting the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4/">AirPods 4</a> is located at the front of the Charging Case, according to <em><a href="https://www.gearpatrol.com/audio/airpods-4-charging-case-hidden-button/">Gear Patrol</a></em>. To initiate pairing mode, the ‌AirPods 4‌ Charging Case can be opened up and then double tapped at the front where the hidden control is located. This hidden button is also used for factory resetting, and <em>Gear Patrol</em> said that either a triple tap or long press and hold gesture initiates a reset.

Below, we recap everything that we know about iOS 18.2.

<h2>iOS 18.2</h2>
<br/>
Apple has been internally testing iOS 18.2 for at least a few months now, based on evidence of the software version in our website's analytics logs.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.2 will likely be released in December, as that is when Apple said that it will be making Apple Intelligence available in localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K., and support for those languages will likely be added in that update. Apple released iOS 15.2, iOS 16.2, and iOS 17.2 in December over the years.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-09-10 16:47:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is adding sleep apnea detection to the Apple Watch Series 10, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, and the Apple Watch Series 9. Given that sleep apnea is a breathing disturbance, it's easy to assume that it requires the blood oxygen sensor, but Apple actually uses an entirely different method to detect it.

<br/>
Breathing Disturbances, the name for the new Apple Watch metric, uses the built-in accelerometer to detect small movements at the wrist that are associated with interruptions to normal respiratory patterns during sleep.
<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch collects 30 days of data and then analyzes it, alerting users if there are consistent signs of moderate to severe sleep apnea. Users will see Elevated or Not Elevated readings under the Breathing Disturb [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the launch of the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4/">AirPods 4</a>, Apple discontinued the low-cost AirPods 2 and AirPods 3, making the AirPods lineup much less confusing. The ‌AirPods 4‌ come in two variants, one with Active Noise Cancellation and one without, allowing Apple to hit two separate price points.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The ‌AirPods 4‌ without Active Noise Cancellation are priced at $129, which is the same price that Apple used to sell the AirPods 2 for. The ANC version is priced at $179, the same cost as the prior-generation AirPods 3.

There wasn't notable difference between the AirPods 2 and AirPods 3 in terms of core functionality, which was undoubtedly confusing to the average consumer not familiar with Apple's products. The new lineup makes it very clear what's what [...]<br>
