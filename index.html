As it turns out, Recall might be a security nightmare for Windows users. Security expert Kevin Beaumont <a href="https://doublepulsar.com/recall-stealing-everything-youve-ever-typed-or-viewed-on-your-own-windows-pc-is-now-possible-da3e12e9465e">recently said</a> (via <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170305/microsoft-windows-recall-ai-screenshots-security-privacy-issues">The Verge</a></em>) that he was able to automate a program that provides plain text data of everything a user has viewed, despite Microsoft's claims that Recall information cannot be exfiltrated remotely.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today shared a trio of humorous Mac ads that focus on the battery life, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a>, and the performance capabilities of Apple silicon notebooks. The "Charged" ad, for example, shows a serious professor commenting on a student's remaining battery life.

"First class of the day and no charger? You're playing a dangerous game..." he says, but the student says that she doesn't have to worry about it because the Mac's battery lasts all day.

In "Powered," a student in a library is approached by a woman who says that laptops aren't meant to handle big files and multiple apps. "You think it won't crash?" she says. "You're a hot dog in a hurricane." The student lets her know that "it's a Mac," so it's "running fine."

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is unlikely to release a foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> before 2027, but it could significantly disrupt the market when it launches, according to Taiwanese research firm <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20240603-12170.html">TrendForce</a>.

<br/>
The report highlights that foldable phones currently represent a mere 1.5% of the smartphone market, with projections suggesting an increase to 4.8% by 2028. Apple is apparently "still evaluating component specifications and performance, with strict requirements for crease and reliability." Screen creasing is an issue that plagues many current foldable devices, raising concerns about long-term durability and the risk of screen damage from debris.

            Justin Long, the face of Apple's iconic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eEG5LVXdKo">"I'm a Mac" commercials</a>, now stars in a short Qualcomm skit promoting Snapdragon-powered PCs.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
At the Computex 2024 keynote, Qualcomm unveiled the new skit featuring Long, who is well-known for his role in Apple's "Get a Mac" commercials nearly two decades ago. Long is depicted as being overwhelmed by a barrage of notifications about app compatibility, low disk space, and battery issues in macOS, prompting him to search for an alternative in the form of a Windows on ARM PC. The ad concludes with Long stating, "Things change," a sentiment echoed by Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon during the event's closing remarks. Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chips debut in new Copilot Plus PCs on June 18.

The <a href="https://howl.me/cmn5Z7bb51W">$449 Sonos Ace headphones</a> have some enticing design elements and features you won't see in Apple's headphones, so we thought we'd compare them to the $549 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> to see which is ultimately better.

In terms of design, both the Sonos Ace and ‌AirPods Max‌ are over-ear headphones that have a premium look, but the ‌AirPods Max‌ have a fancier feel because of the aluminum material.
