            The current Apple TV was released two years ago this month, so you may be wondering when the next model will be released.

In January 2023, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman reported that a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/">new Apple TV was planned for release in the first half of 2024</a>:<blockquote>Beyond the future smart displays and new speaker, Apple is working on revamping its TV box. A new version with the current design is in the works for the first half of next year with a faster processor, the people said.</blockquote>The first half of 2024 passed by without a new Apple TV, so that rumor has expired.

Severance premiered on ‌Apple TV‌+ in February 2022. It was an immediate hit upon its debut, quickly gaining attention for its unique premise and dark tone.

            Rumors strongly suggest Apple will release the seventh-generation iPad mini in November, nearly three years after the last refresh. Here's a roundup of what we're expecting from the next version of Apple's small form factor tablet, based on the latest rumors and reports.

<h2>Design and Display</h2>
<br/>
The new iPad mini is likely to retain its compact 8.3-inch display and overall design introduced with the sixth generation. However, one rumor suggests Apple may address the "jelly scrolling" issue by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/jelly-scrolling-reduced-on-ipad-mini-7/">rotating the screen assembly</a>. This change would be made to minimize the noticeable lag when scrolling vertically in portrait orientation, which is a point of frustration for some users of the current model.
