The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 17e is expected to be a minor upgrade over this year's 16e, launching in early 2026. The main upgrade is likely to be the A19 chip from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, with few other changes expected. It is possible that the device could get the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> and an ‌iPhone‌ 15-style design, but realistically that is likely to occur on a subsequent generation.

            Apple has <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/apple-security-bounty-evolved/">announced</a> a major overhaul of its bug bounty program that doubles the top reward to $2 million for exploit chains that can match the sophistication of mercenary spyware attacks.

In a demo video, a Vivo smartphone features an interface that could be easily mistaken for ‌iOS 26‌. There's a Liquid Glass clock, Control Center, squircle icons, glass-like rounded buttons, translucent app folders and dock, translucent notifications, and even wallpapers that shift with a 2D to 3D effect like Apple's Spatial Scenes.

There is no mistaking the Liquid Glass design influence even though Vivo references water when describing the operating system. "With OriginOS 6, every swipe, scroll, and tap flows like never before. No lags. No stutters. Just effortless motion built for the way you move," reads  [...]<br>
