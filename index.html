            <b>Published:</b> 2023-10-31 06:43:38-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Just over seven years after it was introduced, the Touch Bar has now been fully discontinued on all new MacBooks sold by Apple, marking the end of an era for a hardware feature that was loved by some users and derided by others.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-853221" height="769" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/Touch-Bar-13-Inch-MacBook-Pro.jpg" width="1364"/>
<br/>
The first MacBook Pro models with the Touch Bar were released in October 2016, as part of a controversial redesign that also included a defective butterfly keyboard and the removal of many ports, including an SD card slot, HDMI, and MagSafe. Physical function and Esc keys were also removed in favor of the Touch Bar.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple initially <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2016/10/apple-unveils-groundbreaking-new-macbook-pro/">described</a> the Touch Bar as a "revolutionary" and "breakthrough" interface, but it was clearly not popular enough to stick around.

Apart from having fewer USB-C ports, the lack of Thunderbolt 4 support on the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the base M3 chip means it only supports one display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz, or one display with up to 4K resolution at 120Hz over HDMI.
