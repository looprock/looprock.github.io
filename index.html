The non-profit organization said it was currently developing a version for Apple's spatial computing headset. "We already have a version of VLC running on the Vision Pro," VideoLAN president Jean-Baptiste Kempf told <em>Lowpass</em> writer Janko Roettgers.

<br/>
However, one of the reasons the app hasn't already been released is that the potential user base is still considered too small. "I'm not sure there is any use case yet," added Kempf.

            Apple today stopped signing iOS 17.3.1 preventing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users from downgrading to that version of iOS. iOS 17.3.1 is no longer being signed following the March 5 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-features/">release of iOS 17.4</a>, an update that introduced app ecosystem changes in the EU, new emoji, and more.

<br/>
Apple routinely stops signing older versions of iOS, so it is not unusual that the iOS 17.3.1 update is no longer available. Apple prevents users from installing older versions of iOS to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date and to prevent downgrading to older, less secure versions of the ‌iPhone‌ operating system.
