Apple regularly stops signing older version of iOS, typically within a week or two after a new version is released. When Apple stops signing an update, it can no longer be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side software verification check, so those who have updated to the latest version of iOS cannot downgrade.

            It almost always takes a lawsuit to force the government to give up information that doesn&#8217;t present it in the best light. That&#8217;s the case here, where litigation has finally forced ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) to hand over ICE use of force records.

We discuss what it's going to take to get to alpha, the why behind Ladybird, avoiding incentives other than those of the users, their plans for incremental adoption of Swift as the successor language over C++, and of course what they hope Ladybird can achieve as a truly independent open source browser that's for the people.<br>

Here’s three examples of approaches I’ve come across recently.</em></p><p>You’re trying to convince your organization to put an app platform in place (probably either buying one or building one on-top of Kubernetes), to shift your ops team to platform engineering (just after HR finally changed titles from “Systems Analyst II” to “DevOps Engineer”!), or, if you’re like me, sell people a platform.</p><h1><strong>ROI</strong></h1><p>“Yeah, but what’s the ROI for it?” the Director of No responds.
