            Google has released a new Apple Watch app for Google Calendar, bringing its native calendar and task functionality to watchOS for the first time.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
As of version 25.24.1, users can now access a dedicated Apple Watch app that displays a simplified overview of upcoming events and Google Tasks directly on their wrist. The app presents a week's worth of schedule information in a list format, with each entry appearing as a color-coded card. Each card includes the scheduled time, title of the event or task, and associated location.
<br/>
<br/>
Tapping an item reveals additional event details, although the app does not currently support the creation or editing of events from the watch itself. A message within the app prompts users to open the Google Calendar <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> app t [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-30 07:07:38-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple may reposition the Apple logo on the back of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> for the first time in six years, according to a new leak that points to the redesigned top camera system potentially requiring the visual shift.

<br/>
The claim originates from the leaker known as "Majin Bu," who posted an image and description of the alleged change on <a href="https://x.com/majinbuofficial/status/1938945546556977532?s=61">social media</a> and their <a href="https://t.co/xeC6d0oBeN">personal blog</a>. According to Bu, the Apple logo will move to be noticeably lower on the ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌, closer to the bottom-center of the device's rear. The shift is apparently necessitated by the new, full-width camera bar that is expected to span the entire width of the back [...]<br>

            Chinese display manufacturer BOE is aggressively ramping up its OLED production capacity for future <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models as part of a plan to recapture a major role in Apple's supply chain.

<br/>
In May 2022, Apple halted BOE's inclusion in the ‌iPhone‌ 13's supply chain after detecting unauthorized design modifications. The crisis began when BOE, facing component shortages and yield issues, expanded the circuit width of thin-film transistors in its panels without Apple's approval. When Apple discovered this, Apple instructed BOE to halt production.
<br/>
<br/>
Since then, BOE has gradually sought to return to Apple's good graces. The company was later granted approval to resume supplying OLED panels for the ‌iPhone‌ 14, albeit in limited quantities. Acc [...]<br>
