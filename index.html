            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models with OLED displays are reportedly facing weaker-than-expected demand since their debut in the second quarter, according to a new analyst report.

<br/>
Released in May of this year, the 11-inch and 13-inch devices marked Apple's first use of OLED technology in larger screens and were initially projected to ship up to 10 million units in 2024.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's new iPhone Mirroring feature in macOS Sequoia might seem like a convenient way to access your phone from your work computer, but security firm Sevco has uncovered a significant privacy risk that should make employees think twice before enabling this feature on company-owned Macs, at least for now.

<br/>
According to a <a href="https://www.sevcosecurity.com/iphone-mirroring-expose-employee-personal-information/">new blog post by Sevco</a>, the core issue lies in how iPhone Mirroring interacts with macOS's file system and metadata. When activated, the feature creates "app stubs" for iOS applications in a specific directory on the Mac:

            The current Apple TV was released two years ago this month, so you may be wondering when the next model will be released.

Below, we recap rumors about a next-generation Apple TV.
<br/>
<br/>
In January 2023, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman reported that a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/">new Apple TV was planned for release in the first half of 2024</a>:<blockquote>Beyond the future smart displays and new speaker, Apple is working on revamping its TV box. A new version with the current design is in the works for the first half of next year with a faster processor, the people said.</blockquote>The first half of 2024 passed by without a new Apple TV, so that rumor has expired.
