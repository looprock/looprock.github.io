            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple Maps in iOS 18 introduces two helpful new features: a centralized Library for saved content and the ability to add personal notes to locations. Here's how to take advantage of these new tools.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is working on a more affordable version of its spatial computing headset in the form of a $2,000 "Apple Vision" device that could debut as early as next year, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-10-13/apple-smart-home-plans-new-os-smart-displays-vision-pro-integration-robots-m27kw5m7"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

<br/>
The new headset would be a lower-end counterpart to the $3,500 Apple Vision Pro, which was released in February. Apple reportedly expects this more affordable model to sell at least twice as many units as the Vision Pro, though "that's not saying much," adds Gurman. Apple will struggle to hit 500,000 Vision Pro sales this year, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/11/apple-vision-pro-under-500000-sales-this-year/">according to m</a> [...]<br>

The push for new AR products comes as the Vision Pro faces challenges in the market. Many users find the $3,500 headset too heavy for extended use, expensive, and prone to overheating, relegating it to niche status.

Ahead of those hardware launches, we've recently seen what appears to be one of the most significant physical product leaks in years, while some of the new features in Apple's recent software updates have gained attention for their utility, so read on below for all the details on these stories and more!

<h2>Apple Plans to Release iOS 18.1 With Apple Intelligence on October 28</h2>
<br/>
iOS 18.1 has been in beta testing since before iOS 18.0 was released, as Apple has been working hard on refining the first Apple Intelligence features that will be included in the update, and it appears we now have a &lt;a href="https://www. [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            There have been multiple signs suggesting that Apple's mixed reality Vision Pro headset is struggling to take off, both due to the super high price and the heavy design that limits the amount of time it can be worn for most people. What does the Vision Pro's floundering mean for Apple's work on future virtual and augmented reality projects?

<br/>
<h2>Vision Pro Interest</h2>
<br/>
Interest in the Vision Pro was high in February when the device first launched because it was an all-new product category for Apple, but that didn't last. The Vision Pro is indisputably impressive, and it is mind blowing to watch a butterfly flit by so closely it feels like you can reach out and touch it, or to see the rough skin of an elephant as it walks right by you, but the magic quickly wears off for most.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-10-11 15:55:19-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18.1, there is a new option to set a "Primary" email address in the Settings app, which means it is easier to change the main email address associated with your Apple Account. The Primary email address is the one that is visible to other people when collaborating on and sharing documents, sending calendar invites, and more.

<br/>
Apple did not previously make it easy to change an Apple Account (or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a>) email address, despite the fact that it is sometimes visible to other people. To change an Apple Account email before, you had to delete the email you were using, choose another, and go through a verification process.

You can now change the email address and continue to use the prior email for login purposes right alongside the new primary. This se [...]<br>
