            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's Mac business ended 2025 with flat year-over-year shipments in the holiday quarter despite a broader rebound in the global PC market, according to the <a href="https://www.idc.com/resource-center/press-releases/4q25-pc-top-5-pr/">International Data Corporation</a> (IDC).

<br/>
The findings suggest that global PC shipments rose 9.6% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2025 to 76.4 million units, exceeding expectations as brands accelerated purchases ahead of anticipated supply constraints and component price increases. Within that total, Apple shipped 7.1 million Macs during the quarter, which is essentially unchanged from the same period a year earlier, resulting in a decline in quarterly market share even as the overall market expanded.

            Apple today seeded the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/12/apple-seeds-ios-26-3-beta-2/">second beta of iOS 26.3</a>, nearly a month after the first beta. So far, the update includes a couple of new features for iPhones.

<br/>
iOS 15.3 through iOS 18.3 were all released in late January over the years, so it is thereby likely that iOS 26.3 will be released towards the end of this month as well. The update is compatible with the iPhone 11 series and newer.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/retail/regentstreet/">flagship Regent Street store</a> in London, England is temporarily closed starting today for "refurbishment," the company said on its website.

<br/>
Apple has not indicated when the store will reopen, but a source familiar with the matter indicated that the location will likely be closed for at least a few weeks. It is unclear if Apple is planning any changes that will be visible to customers, but the company has been removing the Video Wall from some of it stores in recent months. Many newer and renovated stores also feature a dedicated Apple Pickup station for online orders.
<br/>
<br/>
In some cases, Apple only updates a store's fixtures or back-of-house area, resulting in no visible differences to customers when business resumes.

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Cowen’s core claim is simple and sharp: in the US, most people won’t lose jobs <em>to AI</em>, they’ll lose them to <em>other people who use AI better</em>. The real bottleneck isn’t models or GPUs - it’s institutions, habits, status hierarchies, and people’s unwillingness to adapt. The transition will be slow, uneven, and psychologically unpleasant, but materially beneficial.</p>
<p>Here’s a structured take, pulling the signal out of the transcript.</p>
<p>1 <strong>AI isn’t killing jobs directly - it’s reshuffling competition.</strong></p>
<p>Cowen’s line worth remembering: <em>“The threat to your job is not AI, it’s some other person who uses AI better than you do."</em> In the US, he expects fewe</p> [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2026-01-12 10:58:22+01:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Feeding the decades of Gartner research into some kind of AI querying thing would be interesting. Making sense of their reports takes a lot of time, and multi-year trends are hard to pick out. Writing into a chat window that was updated with not only the research reports, but also analyst opinions - maybe notes after inquiry meetings, etc.</p>
<p>I have never been a big user of their inquiry service, but I have a feeling that combining a AI-made custom report/chat session with a human follow up would be something new and valuable.</p>
<p>That said, from what Gartner people have told me over the years, every year they try to do The New Thing (social, video, now AI?) and it never really takes off. Classic innovator’s dilemma I guess.</p>
<p>Also, what I think would be very useful for Gartner to do is setup labs and actually run enterprise software, like a Consumer Reports. Having some benchmarks (common use cases) for incompressible things like comparing different CRM/HR systems, or Kubernetes “d</p> [...]<br>

<li><a href="https://thenewstack.io/is-your-ai-assistant-creating-a-recursive-security-loop/">Is Your AI Assistant Creating a Recursive Security Loop?</a> - AI-assisted coding is starting to eat its own tail: the same LLMs that write code are increasingly asked to review it, explain security decisions, and even override their own warnings. That creates recursive trust loops where “explain your reasoning” becomes an attack surface, and models can literally talk themselves out of being secure. The fix isn’t better prompts, it’s old-school architecture - separation of concerns, non-AI enforcement, and treating LLMs as assistants, not authorities.</li>
