            Apple is preparing to launch a dramatically thinner iPhone this September, and if recent leaks are anything to go by, the so-called iPhone 17 Air could boast of the most radical design shifts in recent years.
<br/>

At just <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/iphone-17-air-2mm-thinner/">5.5mm thick</a> (excluding a slightly raised camera bump), the 6.6-inch iPhone 17 Air is expected to become the slimmest iPhone in the lineup by some margin. For comparison, the current iPhone 16 Pro measures 8.25mm thick.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-04-30 03:26:19-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            OpenAI has reversed a recent update to GPT-4o, the model powering ChatGPT, following widespread complaints about the chatbot's strange behavior.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-998332" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/chatgpt-logo.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
Deployed late last week, the update made ChatGPT excessively agreeable and unnaturally effusive in its praise, and the responses quickly became the subject of mockery on social media.
<br/>
<br/>
CEO Sam Altman announced Tuesday that the company had completed the rollback for free users and was working to restore the previous version for paid subscribers. "We're working on additional fixes to model personality and will share more in the coming days," Altman wrote on <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1917291637962858735">X (Twitter)</a>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is making another round of leadership changes across two key divisions ahead of its earnings report on Thursday, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-30/apple-aapl-reshuffles-government-affairs-and-music-units-in-latest-changes">Bloomberg</a></em>'s Mark Gurman.

<br/>
The company's Apple Music division will now be co-managed by longtime Apple executive Rachel Newman and former TikTok music veteran Ole Obermann. Both will report to Oliver Schusser, who has taken on additional responsibilities over the past year including Apple TV+ and sports initiatives.
<br/>
<br/>
The restructuring appears designed to ease Schusser's workload as he continues to oversee the Beats brand and international services while reporting to Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of online services.

Young says that the new ‌Apple Watch SE‌ 3 will be available with 1.6-inch and 1.8-inch display sizes, which suggests little in the way of an upgrade over the current ‌Apple Watch SE‌ models. The ‌Apple Watch SE‌ 2 comes in 40mm and 44mm size options, and Apple could stick with those sizes for the next-generation models.

Pegatron chairman T.H. Tung told <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-tariffs-risk-us-electronics-shortages-taiwans-pegatron-says-2025-04-28/">Reuters</a></em> that the on-again, off-again nature of the levies has created confusion for U.S. retailers and disrupted supply chain decisions.
<br/>
<br/>
"Within two months, shelves in the United States might resemble those in third-world countries, where people visit department stores and markets only to find empty shelves, all because everyone is waiting and seeing," Tung said.

            All upcoming iPhone 17 models will come equipped with 12GB of RAM to support Apple Intelligence, according to the Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PpvMic2B5">Digital Chat Station</a>.

The claim from the Chinese leaker, who has sources within Apple's supply chain, comes a few days after industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/iphone-17-air-12gb-ram-rumor/">all be equipped with 12GB of RAM</a>.

Kuo also said even the base-model iPhone 17 could be equipped with 12GB of RAM, but it will depend on whether supply chain shortages can be overcome. He said that Apple will make a final decision on the amount of RAM it will offer in the regular iPhone 17 model by May. Even if the  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Let&rsquo;s get the AI to build D&amp;D adventures for us with a Model Context Protocol Prompt. I haven&rsquo;t found much value in MCP Prompts until now. What makes them excited is when you use them a &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; to chain together other tool calls. In this episode of my MCP programming series, I show you how to make two MCP Prompts. First, a simple one that boot-straps playing D&amp;D. Second, a more complex one that pulls together an adventure overview using multiple tools and &ldquo;reasoning.&rdquo; I think the result gets to a type of agentic AI.</p>

            <p>The AIs are good at being a Dungeon Master for Dungeons &amp; Dragons, but their memory is limited. How can you make sure they don&rsquo;t forget all that loot you just got, or ensure that cobbler back in the village remembers the type of boots you orders and paid for up front? I&rsquo;ll show you how to use Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create a DM Journal. This is done by writing an MCP Server tool that write journal entries and then an MCP Server Resource that allows you to read them. It&rsquo;s just files, but it&rsquo;s a good excuse to learn some agentic AI coding in Java, with the help of Spring AI.</p>
