            Apple does not yet have to implement changes to its "anti-steering" <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> rules that would allow developers to direct customers to purchase options outside the ‌App Store‌.

As noted by <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/17/23798090/apple-epic-supreme-court-app-store-appeal">The Verge</a></em>, Apple was today granted a motion that prevents it from having to make ‌App Store‌ changes for 90 days, giving the company time to ask the Supreme Court to hear the case.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-07-17 13:52:38-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Some customers who had a poor experience with their Apple Savings accounts handled by Goldman Sachs are receiving one-time credits, according to an email received from <em>MacRumors</em> reader Michael, who made a withdrawal in May.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903569" height="824" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/goldman-sachs-email-credit.jpg" width="1465"/>
<br/>
"The experience we provided for a withdrawal request you made for your Savings account in May did not meet our standards," reads the email. As a thank you, Apple and Goldman Sachs informed Michael that he would be receiving a one-time "goodwill credit" of $100 to his savings account.
<br/>
<br/>
It is not clear how many Apple Savings users have received these credits, but the bonus likely stems from issues that some customers ran into over withdrawal waits.

            It seems to anger certain Elon Musk fans every time I mention it, but pre-Elon Twitter was generally doing okay. Not great. Not terrible. Just okay.

Writing in his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-16/apple-creates-new-vision-products-group-vpg-for-future-mixed-reality-headsets-lk5g2ee4">latest Power On newsletter</a>, Gurman said sources tell him an October event will follow Apple's iPhone 15 series announcement in September, and the state of Apple's current product lineup suggests it will focus on new Macs with M3 chips.
<br/>
<br/>
Given that Apple launched new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models in January, and more recently new 15-inch MacBook Air, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro models in June, Gurman believes the first beneficiaries of the new M3 chip will be the next iMac, 13-inch MacBook Air, and 13-inch MacBook Pro.
