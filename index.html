<br/>
Gurman only briefly mentioned the possibility of AirPods gaining tiny cameras, as part of his <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/new-airpods-to-feature-ir-cameras/"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> intro this week, focused on Apple's future wearables ambitions. He did not explain what the cameras would be used for.
<br/>
<br/>
The tiny cameras would not be for taking photos, but rather serve as infrared sensors.

In a June 2024 blog post, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple planned to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/new-airpods-to-feature-ir-cameras/">m</a> [...]<br>

            After hanging on to my iPhone 14 Pro for a few years, I will likely upgrade to an iPhone 17 model this year. Typically, I only consider the Pro models, but the rumored iPhone 17 Air sounds intriguing.

Of course, the iPhone 17 Air is not yet official. Apple should announce the device in September, and rumors could change between now and then. Below, I have compared the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 17 Air as things currently stand.

In a <a href="https://x.com/BenStiller/status/1882792326982250665">short video shared today</a> by "Severance" executive producer Ben Stiller, Apple CEO Tim Cook visits Lumon Industries. He enters the office's elevator and undergoes the severance procedure, which divides his memories between his work and personal life. Cook arrives to the severed floor as his "innie," wearing a "Tim C." name tag.

A stoic but smiling Tim C. walks down a hallway and enters a room with Milchick, who greets him by calling him the "core of the apple." Cook sits down in front of a TV, which will play a video walki [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple announced the Macintosh 41 years ago today, introducing the first widely successful personal computer with a graphical user interface.

<br/>
The Macintosh revolutionized personal computing by popularizing the use of a mouse to control an on-screen pointer. At the time, this point-and-click navigation method was unfamiliar to most, as personal computers primarily relied on text-based command-line interfaces operated with a keyboard. An excerpt from Apple's <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/dept/SUL/sites/mac/primary/docs/pr1.html">press release</a> in 1984:

<blockquote>Users tell Macintosh what to do simply by moving a "mouse" — a small pointing device — to select among functions listed in menus and represented by pictorial symbols on the screen. Users are no longer forced to memorize the nu</blockquote> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Threads, Meta's social network that's meant to rival X, has announced it is rolling out the ability for all users to schedule posts.

<br/>
Threads can now be created and scheduled to go up at a later date and time. Multiple posts can be scheduled per day, up to 75 days in advance, but it's not possible to schedule replies.
<br/>
<br/>
To use the feature, create a post, select the three-dot menu in the top-left corner, and select "Schedule." Once a time and date for posting has been selected, you can view, delete, or edit the post from the drafts folder.

            <p>People continue to tell me on a semi-regular basis how much they appreciate these approximately annual posts, the first of which came out in April of 2017. I think this might be more because the project doesn't have enough official ways to recognize people than it is an endorsement of the particular thing that I've done here, the limitations of which I am always careful to mention. In particular, I do not intend this as a comprehensive picture of contributions to the project, or even to development activity; and I lack the data to fairly divide credit for a single commit between multiple individuals. Nevertheless, I am very grateful to all the people who have expressed appreciation for these posts, or told me about the value that they derived from them.

            At Yelp, we encountered challenges that prompted us to enhance the training time of our ad-revenue generating models, which use a Wide and Deep Neural Network architecture for predicting ad click-through rates (pCTR). These models handle large tabular datasets with small parameter spaces, requiring innovative data solutions. This blog post delves into our journey of optimizing training time using TensorFlow and Horovod, along with the development of ArrowStreamServer, our in-house library for low-latency data streaming and serving. Together, these components have allowed us to achieve a 1400x speedup in training for business critical models compared to using a single GPU...<br>
