It is not unusual that iOS 17.1.1 and iOS 17.1.2 are no longer being signed.

As noted by <em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-testflight-servers-from-2012-to-2015-leak-containing-terabytes-of-data">Eurogamer</a></em>, a huge number of TestFlight files were found archived on Wayback Machine and were shared anonymously on X, previously known as Twitter.

            Alongside iOS 17.2.1, Apple today released iOS 16.7.4 and iPadOS 16.7.4 updates that fix an issue with built-in apps. In some cases, if a user deleted a built-in Apple app on a device running iOS or iPadOS 16.7.3 or earlier, the app would not be able to be reinstalled.

From Apple's release notes for the update:<blockquote>This update fixes an issue where built-in Apple apps that may have been deleted may not reinstall.</blockquote>While we haven't heard many complaints about the issue, that is likely because the majority of users have transitioned over to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>.

            Apple today introduced a new firmware update for the third-generation AirPods. The new firmware is version 6A317, up from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-releases-new-airpods-firmware-2/">6A300 firmware</a> introduced in September.

Apple's AirPods firmware updates do not come with details on new features, so it is unclear what might be included in the software.

Apple also does not offer instructions on how to upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ are connected to an iOS device.

<br/>
For those unfamiliar with Shazam, it's an Apple-owned popular service that can identify the names and lyrics of songs, music videos, TV shows, and more, simply by listening to and deciphering whatever is playing. 
<br/>
<br/>
After years of ‌‌Siri‌‌ integration, Apple acquired Shazam in 2018, and integrated it into iOS and iPadOS as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-shazam-without-downloading-app/">system-level song recognition function</a>.
