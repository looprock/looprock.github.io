            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple held off on announcing two <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> features that it still plans to release this year, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>.

<br/>
In the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-06-29/apple-should-launch-oura-ring-competitor-tethered-vision-pro-ios-26-beta-2-mchmc20h?srnd=undefined">latest edition</a> of his "Power On" newsletter, Gurman explained that Apple did not want to risk repeating WWDC 2024, where it announced an array of features that were ultimately delayed by months or still haven't arrived. As a result, at least two ‌iOS 26‌ features were not shown at WWDC, but are still apparently scheduled to arrive as part of ‌iOS 26‌ this year.

Originally introduced by Apple in 2014 as a modern programming language for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS, Swift has since expanded to include official support for Linux and Windows. The Swift project this week announced a formal effort to support Android as a target platform, enabling developers to use Swift to build applications for Google's mobile operating system using official tooling and infrastructure.
