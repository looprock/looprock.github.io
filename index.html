            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Iteration has long been one of the more fragmented areas of Go, with developers relying on ad hoc patterns to traverse custom data structures. This article explores the range-over-functions experiment, a proposed evolution of the language that introduces a standardized iterator model while preserving Go&rsquo;s familiar for range syntax. Using the new iter package and sequence abstractions, it shows how iteration logic can be expressed more clearly, flexibly, and idiomatically. Originally published in April 2024, the concepts remain highly relevant as Go continues to evolve toward more expressive yet simple language features.</p><br>

            <p>Internal development teams and executives are increasingly looking at AI to automate the creation of internal developer platforms. However, cobbling together open-source components with AI is a far cry from building a scalable, secure, and &ldquo;enterprise-grade&rdquo; environment. In this conversation, we explore why betting your internal infrastructure on AI-generated platforms is a high-stakes risk and why human-led architecture still dictates the long-term success of a platform.</p>
