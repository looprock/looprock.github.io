            <b>Published:</b> 2023-07-19 03:08:06-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/spectre-camera/id1450074595">Spectre</a>, the long-exposure AI-powered iPhone camera app made by the developers of the popular Halide photography app, is now free. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903761" height="1700" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/spectre-pro.jpeg" width="3000"/>
<br/>
For those unfamiliar with Spectre, the app uses a computational shutter to take hundreds of photos over the course of a few seconds to create an up to 3-second long exposure. 
<br/>
<br/>
Because it's taking hundreds of images instead of one continuous shot, users can hold their phone while taking long exposure images with Spectre, no tripod necessary.
<br/>
<br/>
Previously $1.99, the app's switch to freeware marks the introduction of a new paid-for Pro version, which includes additional 15- and 30-second exposure modes, plus a new Pro icon.

            Apple today shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asKvPLmjxXY">humorous new video</a> on its YouTube channel that dramatizes many of the security features available when using Apple products at work.

<div class="center-wrap"></div>

Titled "Swiped," the spot opens with a design team that is shortly about to give a "game-changing" presentation to a client, only for the MacBook Air on which the presentation exists to be swiped by thieves in the street when the team leader turns her back.
<br/>
<br/>
The eight-minute video follows the team's attempt to retrieve the stolen Mac in time for the crucial presentation before the bumbling thieves can pawn it off. 
<br/>
<br/>
The film showcases several Apple security features that aid the team and thwart the thieves, including Notify When Left Behind, Find My location tracking, Touch ID and Face ID, passwords and passkeys, Secure Enclave, end-to-end encryption, MDM Remote Lock and Remote Wipe, remote Erase This Device, and more.
