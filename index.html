            Apple's Vision Pro headset will launch in the last week of January, a sketchy online report coming out of China claims.

The information comes from <a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/livenews/2603883"><em>Wall Street Insights</em></a>, a Chinese investor news service with an unproven track record for Apple rumors. The website claims to have obtained exclusive information suggesting that the Vision Pro will launch on Saturday, January 27 in the United States. While the report clearly says that the launch is set to occur on a date that falls on a Saturday in the United States, there is a chance that the website is actually referring to January 27 in China, which falls on Friday, January 26 in the United States – a much more likely date for the launch of the Vision Pro.

            Apple has broken a tradition it maintained for 12 years, releasing no new iPads in 2023 – the first time that the company has chosen to not launch a new tablet in an entire calendar year since the introduction of the product line.

<br/>
From its debut in 2010, the iPad has been an important product for Apple and the clear tablet market leader, releasing at least one new model every year. In recent times, the company has released as many as four new iPad models per year. Before 2023, 2009 was the last year with no new iPads, simply because the product line had not yet launched. 
<br/>
<br/>
The most recent iPad launches took place in October 2022. The only iPad-adjacent hardware released in 2023 was the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/new-apple-pencil-with-usb-c-announced/">Apple Pencil with USB-C</a>.
