            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Three hours after releasing the second betas of iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3, Apple has pulled the updates from the Developer Center and over the air, meaning they are no longer available to download and install.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple has removed the iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 betas after a number of people reported that the software is bricking devices. According to reports on <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-3-beta-2-bug-fixes-changes-and-improvements.2415339/">the <em>MacRumors</em> forums</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/BrandonButch/status/1742628347002204350">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@_inside/111693591558795389">Mastodon</a>, some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owners who updated found their devices stuck in a boot loop.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-01-03 13:14:00-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Last month, many Apple Music subscribers reported that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/04/apple-music-add-playlist-songs-to-library-bug/">"Add Playlist Songs" setting was broken</a> on the iPhone, iPad, and sometimes the Mac. After a user toggled off the setting, the bug could cause it to turn back on, resulting in any songs that a user added to a playlist being added to their music library in an unwanted manner.

<br/>
Fortunately, it appears that Apple quickly addressed the bug with a server-side fix, and users are no longer impacted by this issue. Given it was a server-side fix, users do not need to update their devices to a newer software version for it to apply.
<br/>

Apple never publicly acknowledged the bug, so the underlying cause is unclear.<div class="linkback">Tag: &lt;a href="https</div> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>In the past, sellers were responsible for managing and fulfilling their own tax obligations. 
However, more and more jurisdictions are now requiring marketplaces such as Etsy to collect the tax from buyers and remit the tax to the relevant authorities. Etsy now plays an active role in collecting tax from buyers and remitting it all over the world. In this post, I will walk you through our tax calculation infrastructure and how we adapted to the ongoing increase in traffic and business needs over the years.</p>

<p>We determine tax whenever a buyer adds an item to their Etsy shopping cart. The tax determination is based on buyer and seller location and product category, and a set of tax rules and mappings. To handle the details of these calculations we partner with Vertex, and issue a call to their <a href="https://www.vertexinc.com/">tax engine</a> via the Quotation Request API to get the right amount to show in our buyer's cart. </p>
<p>Vertex ensures ac</p> [...]<br>

The information comes from <a href="https://wallstreetcn.com/livenews/2603883"><em>Wall Street Insights</em></a>, a Chinese investor news service with an unproven track record for Apple rumors. The website claims to have obtained exclusive information suggesting that the Vision Pro will launch on Saturday, January 27 in the United States. While the report clearly says that the launch is set to occur on a date that falls on a Saturday in the United States, there is a chance that the website is actually referring to January 27 in China, which falls on Friday, January 26 in the United States – a much more likely date for the launch of the Vision Pro.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has broken a tradition it maintained for 12 years, releasing no new iPads in 2023 – the first time that the company has chosen to not launch a new tablet in an entire calendar year since the introduction of the product line.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
From its debut in 2010, the iPad has been an important product for Apple and the clear tablet market leader, releasing at least one new model every year. In recent times, the company has released as many as four new iPad models per year. Before 2023, 2009 was the last year with no new iPads, simply because the product line had not yet launched. 
<br/>
<br/>
The most recent iPad launches took place in October 2022. The only iPad-adjacent hardware released in 2023 was the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/new-apple-pencil-with-usb-c-announced/">Apple Pencil with USB-C</a>.
