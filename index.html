That's according to anecdotal reports collected by <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-maps-app-popularity-iphone-8e52aec1">The Wall Street Journal</a></em> (paywalled). While Apple Maps comes preinstalled on all iPhones, the overwhelming majority of iPhones in the U.S. have Google Maps downloaded as an alternative, according to Canalys.

<br/>
But that hasn't stopped some users becoming particularly impressed by how far Apple's transit route information has come. The app is often recommended by users for its cleaner view versus the more cluttered design of Google Maps.

"The experience we provided for a withdrawal request you made for your Savings account in May did not meet our standards," reads the email. As a thank you, Apple and Goldman Sachs informed Michael that he would be receiving a one-time "goodwill credit" of $100 to his savings account.
