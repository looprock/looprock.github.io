            The idea/expression dichotomy strikes again! There is a misconception among some as to how copyright works, specifically in terms of what is protected under copyright and what is not.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the new Passwords app in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, iPadOS 18, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, there's a feature that is designed to allow websites and apps to upgrade existing accounts to passkeys automatically.

<br/>
Enabled by default, the feature will speed up the adoption of passkeys, which are more secure than a traditional login and password. Passkeys log you in with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> rather than a password, and because on-device authentication is required, passkeys put a stop to online attacks like phishing. There's no password to steal or authentication code that can be intercepted.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Here is something that Apple TV HD owners probably didn't expect when they purchased the device all the way back in 2015: it continues to receive software updates.

            With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple is expanding the Emergency SOS via satellite feature to introduce Messages via satellite, a feature that will let you send texts even when you don't have a Wi-Fi or cellular connection.

<br/>
Available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> or later, you can send and receive iMessages or SMS messages using a satellite connection. The feature works with all iMessage features such as emoji and Tapbacks, plus with iMessage, conversations are end-to-end encrypted.

Messages via satellite will work on the ‌iPhone 14‌ and later, aka the same devices that support Emergency SOS via satellite. Apple did not specify whether there will be a cost for Messages via satellite, but Emergency SOS via satellite [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today confirmed that it plans to implement support for Rich Communication Services, or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a>, in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> this fall.

<br/>
We've known about Apple's plans to adopt ‌RCS‌ since last November, but Apple only gave a vague "later in 2024" timeline for adoption so it was unclear exactly when the feature might roll out. ‌RCS‌ replaces SMS/MMS as the default communication protocol on the ‌iPhone‌.

‌RCS‌ has already been adopted by Google, U.S. smartphone carriers, and other companies,  [...]<br>

Less crass: be easy/instant to install and run, and have good docs that explain how to do [I&rsquo;d say 2 to 3 example apps/uses]. Even better: be a SaaS, at least have that as an option. All of this advice is pretty difficult for a full on, private cloud platform to do. You can&rsquo;t just &ldquo;install a cloud&rdquo; in a few minutes and mess around with it. Let alone, like, multi-region, etc. I think. Maybe someone could figure it out? That would actually be a good sign: if your platform is easy to install for demo&rsquo;ing, it will probably be easy to install for reals.<!-- category:link --></p><br>
