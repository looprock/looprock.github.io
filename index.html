<br/>
Referred to as "advanced chat privacy," the new option has a toggle in a recent WhatsApp beta for iOS. By turning it on, you can prevent individual users or people in a group chat from exporting the entire chat history outside of WhatsApp.

Enabling the option in a group chat causes everyone in the chat to be notified that advanced chat privacy has been enabled. WaBetaInfo says that turning on the toggle also turns off Meta AI, which lets users interact with a chat bot as part of the wider conversation.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Ahead of when new reciprocal tariffs go into effect on April 9, Apple customers are scrambling to buy devices before prices go up.

The 26 percent tariff on goods imported from India will be less of a hit to Apple's bottom line than the 54 percent tariff on goods from China, the 46 percent tariff in Vietnam, or the 36 percent tariff in Thailand.

Apple does not plan to make major changes to its supply chain because the tariff situation is "too uncertain." Sourcing more U.S. iPhones from India will offset the cost of the tariffs in China, and Apple is viewing that as a short term solution wh [...]<br>

<br/>
Apple shares opened at $177.24 today, as the company's stock price has continued to drop since U.S. President Donald Trump last week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/02/apple-stock-trump-tariffs/">announced steep new tariffs</a>. The tariffs will significantly impact Apple, which still assembles the majority of iPhones and many other devices in China, which is facing a 54% tariff starting April 9.

About an hour into the trading session, however, Apple's stock briefly surged to as high as $194.14, following <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-reverses-course-hassetts-142738704.html">reports</a> th [...]<br>

<br/>
The upcoming tariffs range from 20% to 46% across Apple's global manufacturing hubs. India, where Apple increasingly builds iPhones and AirPods, will face a 26% tariff. Vietnam, which produces AirPods, iPads, Apple Watches and Macs, will be hit with a 46% levy. Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and even Ireland will face tariffs between a 20% and 37%.
