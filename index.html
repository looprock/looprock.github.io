            Samsung today introduced the <a href="https://howl.link/chaeu38jiafc4">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, an ultra thin smartphone that will compete with Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> "Air." The Galaxy S25 Edge features a 6.7-inch AMOLED display and it measures in at 5.8mm thick.

Comparatively, rumors suggest that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a> will have a 6.6-inch display and a thickness of 5.5mm, so it may be slightly smaller and thinner than the S25 Edge.

The Galaxy S25 Ultra weighs 218 grams, while the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max weighs 227 grams.

The new logo was first noticed by <em><a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/12/google-icon-update/">9to5Google</a></em>, and while it has the same shape and color palette as the original, there is a gradient that blends each of the colors together instead of the previous color block look.

Google is already using the new logo for the Google Search app on iOS and the Android Google app. Google has not updated its full six character logo with the change to the G logo, as that design does not use blended colors.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a></div><br/>This article, "&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/google-logo-desi [...]<br>

            The iOS 18.5 update that Apple released today includes a security fix for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a>'s C1 modem, which is the first Apple-designed modem.

<br/>
According to Apple's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/122404">security support document</a> for iOS 18.5, there's a fix for a vulnerability with the C1 modem. Apple says that it addressed a baseband security flaw that could allow an attacker "in a privileged network position" to intercept network traffic. Basically, a hacker that had access to cellular network infrastructure could potentially exploit the vulnerability for surveillance or to employ a man-in-the-middle attack.

Labeling your Bluetooth accessories helps to identify connected devices and improve audio notifications. Apple says that classifying Bluetooth accessories like this can also ensure that real-time Headphone Audio Level measurements are accurate.

When using headphones with an iPhone, for example, you can check the audio level in decibels by viewing the Hearing control in Control Center. In the Health app, you can also review the history of your headphone listening habits.

            Although originally written in 2018, the following concepts remain essential for developers working with concurrency. This blogpost focuses on concurrency, distinguishing it from parallelism by defining it as &ldquo;out of order&rdquo; execution. It emphasizes the importance of understanding workload types—CPU bound (e.g., summing, sorting) and IO bound (e.g., file reading)—to assess when concurrency is appropriate. Through practical examples and benchmarks, it shows that parallelism boosts performance for CPU bound tasks, while concurrency alone benefits IO bound workloads.<br>

This system comprises of diverse sub-systems designed to monitor, measure, and optimize ad campaigns. At Netflix, we embarked on a journey to build a robust event processing platform that not only meets the current demands but also scales for future needs. This blog post delves into the architectural evolution and technical decisions that underpin our Ads event processing pipeline.</p><p>Ad serving acts like the “brain” — making decisions, optimizing delivery and ensuring right Ad is shown to the right member at the right time. Meanwhile, ad events, after an Ad is rendered, function like “heartbeats”, continuously providing real-time feedback (oxygen/nutrients) that fuels better decision-making, optimizations, reporting, measurement, and billing.
