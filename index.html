            <p>Employees think working from home is fine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hybrid work has moved from novelty to normality, but employers and employees are no longer aligned on what it should look like. More than half of employees (56%) now work in the office full-time, yet only 15% would choose this pattern, with three-quarters (75%) preferring a more balanced approach.</p>
<p>This widening gap signals that organizations face a choice: continue to rely on presence-led models or shift toward purpose-led ones. Presence-led approaches treat attendance as a stand-in for productivity, yet many employees question the value of being on site when work can be completed just as effectively elsewhere. This is reinforced by over 80% of respondents saying that their employer is already well equipped for hybrid working, and by the fact that the main advantages of office time are relationship-driven rather than operational.</p>

            <b>Published:</b> 2026-01-02 16:33:00-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is planning to release a low-cost MacBook in 2026, which will apparently compete with more affordable Chromebooks and Windows PCs. Apple's most affordable Mac right now is the $999 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, and the upcoming low-cost MacBook is expected to be cheaper. Here's what we know about the low-cost MacBook so far.

<h2>Size</h2>
<br/>
Rumors suggest the low-cost MacBook will have a display that's around 13 inches in size. The ‌MacBook Air‌ has a 13.6-inch display, so the more affordable MacBook will likely be slightly smaller. It's sounding like it won't be too far off from the 13-inch ‌MacBook Air‌, though.

            Pebble today announced that it is bringing back the Pebble Time Round, one of its most iconic smartwatches from a decade ago. The new Pebble Round 2 builds on the Pebble Time Round, eliminating some of the compromises that had to be made with the original model.

<br/>
The Pebble Round 2 features a bezel-free 1.3-inch color e-paper display, and it comes in matte black, brushed silver, and rose gold. Advances in Bluetooth technology mean that it lasts for up to two weeks before needing to be recharged, and it remains as thin as the original.
