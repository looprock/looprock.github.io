            Apple's online store in the U.S. is suddenly offering a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-airtag/airtag/4-pack">pack of four AirTags</a> for just $29, which is the same price as a single AirTag.

<br/>
This is likely a pricing error, and it is unclear if orders will be fulfilled. Apple has not discounted the AirTag four-pack in any other countries that we checked.

Delivery estimates are already pushing into late November to early December, suggesting that many customers are attempting to take advantage of the deal.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's first foldable iPhone will feature an industry-first 24-megapixel under-screen camera built into the inner display, according to the latest JP Morgan equity research report seen by <em>MacRumors</em>.

<br/>
We've previously heard rumors that Apple will use an under-display camera for the book-style foldable's inner display, but this is the first reference to the camera's proposed megapixel count.
<br/>
<br/>
Under-display camera technology has been used on some Android phones, but they tend to have lower resolution sensors (4 or 8 megapixels, for example) because the image quality suffers due to being behind display layers.
<br/>
<br/>
The jump to a 24-megapixel camera (with six plastic lens elements, per the report) would therefore be a significant technological advance, potentially resulting in clearer, sharper  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>

<br/>
According to <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/QcIHO20a0">Digital Chat Station</a>, a Weibo account with more than three million followers, Apple is testing a single HIIA (hole-in-active-area) hole punch for the front-facing camera, which is currently located within the Dynamic Island.
<br/>
<br/>
HIAA is a display manufacturing technique developed by Samsung and other display makers that integrates front-facing cameras into OLED panels without taking up too much of the active screen. The technique involves precisely drilling a small hole within the active pixel area using laser micro-drilling, resulting in a single ultra-compact aperture opening.

<p>[M]any organizations remain stuck in siloed approaches that pose problems due to competing demands for speed, efficiency and risk reduction. Enterprises that effectively integrate security into software development and deployment–both through platforms and tools, and via cross-team collaboration– are better positioned to drive velocity, quality and innovation while maintaining and even improving security."</p>
<p>Also, if you must Kubernetes, try to run just one, or as few as possible: ”given the array of tools and personas involved, organizations must contend with complexity, staffing and other hurdles in addition to cost, security and integration issues. Thus, it is critical to leverage a single platform that integrates the many open-source components of an effective Kubernetes deployment and supports the different personas (e.g., cloud admins, platform engineers and security teams) involved.”</p>

Qualcomm's semiconductor arm, known as Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT), apparently recorded strong year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, led by rising Android device sales and increasing chip content per device. <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></em> cited remarks from President and CEO Cristiano Amon, who said that non-Apple QCT revenue rose by 18% during the quarter.

            U.S. media mergers always follow the same trajectory. Pre-merger, executives promise all manner of amazing synergies and deal benefits. Post-merger, not only do those benefits generally never arrive, the debt from the acquisition spree usually results in significant layoffs, lower quality product, and higher rates for consumers.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple in iOS 26.2 will disable automatic Wi-Fi network syncing between iPhone and Apple Watch in the European Union to comply with the bloc's regulations, suggests a new report.

<br/>
Normally, when an iPhone connects to a new Wi-Fi network, it automatically shares the network credentials with the paired Apple Watch. This allows the watch to connect to the same network independently – for example, when the iPhone isn't nearby – without the user needing to enter the password manually.
<br/>

The feature's removal appears to be Apple's response to the European Commission's Digital Markets Act (DMA) interoperability requirements, which Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/19/apple-eu-interoperability-bad-for-products-users/">publicly criticized</a> on  [...]<br>
