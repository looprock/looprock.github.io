            Apple has begun placing prominent warning labels on EU App Store listings that use alternative payment methods.

<br/>
According to the Weibo-based account <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PrVl5kiGX">Digital Chat Station</a>, the inner display on the book-style foldable is a 14.1:1 panel featuring an under-screen camera, while the outer screen is a 14.6:1 panel with a hole-punch camera.
<br/>
<br/>
The leaker claims that these specifications relate to a new engineering prototype from Apple that's "slightly smaller than the previous unit we handled, with the same resolution and aspect ratio," according to a machine translation. The leaker added that a Touch ID sensor is included on the side of the device.

            Apple this week introduced a new feature designed to allow prospective <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> users to import their saved music and playlists from third-party music services to ‌Apple Music‌.

<br/>
It turns out that it may have been a bad idea dropping the well-recognized HBO brand name from the Max streaming service and opting for a much more generic name. In a blog post explaining the decision, WBD says that the HBO brand is best known for its consistent, high-quality content, which is what the company wants to focus on.
