When new versions of iOS are released, Apple typically stops signing the prior version after a week or two. An update that is not signed is not able to be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ because there is a server-side software verification check.

By preventing downgrading to older versions of iOS, Apple ensures that users keep their devices up to date with the newest security improvements.

            Sonos CEO Patrick Spence has stepped down after eight years, following widespread criticism over the company's failed app redesign (via <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-13/sonos-ceo-patrick-spence-leaving-after-failed-app-revamp-led-to-customer-revolt">Bloomberg</a></em>).

<br/>
The company has appointed board member and former Snap and Pandora executive Tom Conrad as interim CEO, effective immediately, while the search for a permanent replacement is conducted. The catalyst for the leadership shake-up was the May 2024 launch of a redesigned Sonos app, which sought to modernize the software and alongside adding support for the company's first headphones, the Sonos Ace, which were positioned to compete with Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            A new social engineering tactic is being used by cybercriminals to trick iPhone users into disabling iMessage's built-in phishing protection, in a bid to expose them to malicious links and scams, according to <em><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/phishing-texts-trick-apple-imessage-users-into-disabling-protection/">BleepingComputer</a></em>.

The scam exploits a security feature in iMessage that automatically disables links from unknown senders. Apple told the outlet that when users reply to these messages or add the sender to their contacts, the links become clickable – a behavior that scammers are now actively exploiting, according to the report. The deceptive messages often masquerade as notifications from trusted organizations like USPS or toll road authorities.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is heading to court in London on Monday to defend against a class-action lawsuit seeking £1.5 billion ($1.9 billion) in damages over alleged anti-competitive App Store practices in the UK.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-804521" height="1009" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/app-store-blue-banner-uk-fixed.jpg" width="1794"/>
<br/>
Filed by King's College London academic Dr. Rachael Kent, the lawsuit claims Apple has violated UK and European competition laws by requiring iOS users to download apps exclusively through the App Store while charging developers a commission of up to 30% on purchases.
<br/>
<br/>
The legal action represents around 19.6 million UK iPhone and iPad users who may have been overcharged for apps and in-app purchases between October 2015 and November 2024. Under UK law, affected users are automatically included in the claim unless they opt out.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple may choose to refresh its iPad Air models in the spring with an M4 chip, skipping the M3 generation for the lineup entirely, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has suggested.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-967393" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ipad-air-gradient.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Apple released the M2 iPad Air in 11-inch and 13-inch screen sizes in May of last year, and the going assumption, backed by rumors, was that Apple would refresh the iPad Air this year with an M3 chip upgrade. 
<br/>
<br/>

            Apple's long-rumoured smart home hub or "command center" may not arrive in the spring as previously expected, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-978083" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Apple-AI-Command-Center-Concept-Mock-Gray-3.5.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
We've heard various rumors and reports about Apple developing an all-in-one smart home management hub. The device is said to feature a square-shaped 7-inch display, a FaceTime camera and speakers, and a new homeOS operating system with support for several Apple apps. Rumors suggest users will be able to mount it on a wall, but Apple is also designing a dock that will let it sit on a table or desk. 
<br/>
<br/>
Apple originally planned to introduce the home hub in March 2025. However, writing in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-12/apple-2025-plans-iphone-17-smart-home-hub-ios-19-ai-apple-watch-ipads-m5">P</a> [...]<br>
