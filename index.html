            <b>Published:</b> 2024-11-23 08:36:57-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            For the first time in nearly a decade, Apple is able to repair individual MacBook Pro speakers without replacing other components too.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979210" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/2024-MacBook-Pro-Space-Black.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
In a memo shared with Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers this week, Apple said it is offering speakers as standalone repair parts for the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with the M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips. This is the first time Apple has made individual MacBook Pro speaker parts available since 2015.
<br/>
<br/>
For all MacBook Pro models released between 2016 and 2023, Apple replaces the entire "top case" with the battery and other components for speaker repairs. This results in out-of-warranty speaker repairs costing hundreds of dollars more than they should, so standalone speaker parts will make these repairs far more affordable.

            Apple is working on a new Home accessory that is designed to serve as a central hub or "Command Center" for smart home management. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> are already home hubs and almost all Apple devices can control a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> setup, but Apple is designing an all-in-one home management product to make control even easier.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Repair site iFixit today shared a teardown video of the M4 Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a>, giving us a look inside of the machine. Apple didn't make any external design changes to the ‌MacBook Pro‌ models, but iFixit was hopeful for repairability improvements.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the M4 Pro ‌MacBook Pro‌ that iFixit took apart was almost identical to the M3 ‌MacBook Pro‌, which means Apple kept almost the same internal design as well.
<br/>
<br/>
The M4 Pro ‌MacBook Pro‌ has a larger heatsink than the M3 ‌MacBook Pro‌ for improved heat dissipation, but the battery build and size are the same. Removing the battery still requires removing the trackpad because the battery's adhesive tabs are under the trackpad hardware. Getting to the logic board is "incredibly complex and tedious" due to all the screws and the cables that are in the way.

<br/>
Apple previously announced that new "Silo" episodes would be released on Fridays, but the third episode of the second season will instead be released on Wednesday, November 27. Apple has likely bumped up the date so that people can watch the episode during the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, November 28.
<br/>
<br/>
As astute Apple TV+ viewers know, this actually means the episode should be available to watch as early as Tuesday, November 26 at 9 p.m. Eastern Time.
<br/>
<br/>
"Silo" follows the last 10,000 people on Earth, all of whom live in a massive underground bunker to escape the seemingly toxic and deadly world outside. The people are unaware of why the silo was built, and those who seek the truth face deadl [...]<br>

            Introduction: Welcome to Episode 6 of the Fearless Concurrency in Rust series! In this episode, we explore the powerful concept of ARC (Atomic Reference Counting) and its critical role in managing shared resources in multithreaded Rust programs. By leveraging ARC, developers can safely share ownership of data across threads without relying on a traditional garbage collector, enabling efficient, flexible, and scalable concurrency.
What is ARC?: Understanding Atomic Reference Counting as a lightweight, manual garbage collection system.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If we plot the metrics associated with large DDoS attacks observed in the last 10 years, does it show a straight, steady increase in an exponential curve that keeps becoming steeper, or is it closer to a linear growth? Our analysis found the growth is not linear but rather is exponential, with the slope varying depending on the metric (rps, pps or bps).<br>
