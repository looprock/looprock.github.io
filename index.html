<blockquote>
<p>If 2025 had a theme, it would be growth. Every second, more than one new developer on average joined GitHub–over 36 million in the past year. It’s our fastest absolute growth rate yet and 180 million-plus developers now work and build on GitHub.</p>

The first question is how many developers total are there? There are probably not one billion developers. Are there 700m, 500m, 300m developers in the world?</p>

            Apple's iPhone development roadmap runs several years into the future and the company is continually working with suppliers on several successive iPhone models at the same time, which is why we often get rumored features months ahead of launch. The iPhone 18 series is no different, and we already have a good idea of what to expect for the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max.

<br/>
One thing worth noting is that Apple is reportedly planning a major change to its iPhone release cycle next year, adopting a two-phase rollout starting with the iPhone 18 series. That means the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and iPhone Fold will be released in September 2026, followed by the iPhone 18 and iPhone 18e in spring 2027.

<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/29/forrester_ai_rehiring/">Forrester’s analysis</a> found that using AI for financially driven layoffs can backfire: 55 percent of employers regret laying off workers because of AI. More people in charge of AI investment expect it to increase headcount (57 percent) than to decrease it (15 percent) over the next year.</p>

<p>Either that, or start by replacing the executives with an AI. A more retention friendly alternate would be to give staff a month long sabbatical and require executives to only use AIs for a month. If they wanted to be really 9-9-6, make that quarter sabbatical .</p>

            <p>Rarely are there opportunities for big, bold, game-changing improvements in web performance. The Speculation Rules API (SRA) is a recent browser development that offers just such an opportunity. This post details a joint effort between the search and the web performance teams at Etsy to implement SRA on Etsy search pages and drastically improve the performance of product listing pages with some metrics seeing 20-24% improvements and some dropping all the way to 0ms values.</p>
<h2>Prefetching Options</h2>
<p>There are two main ways to predictively fetch resources for the next page:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><code>&lt;link rel="prefetch"&gt;</code></em> allows us to instruct the browser to download a resource we believe we'll need soon. The resource can be anything, like a static asset or an HTML page.  </li>
