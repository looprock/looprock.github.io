            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's market capitalization briefly surpassed $4 trillion just after opening today, making it the third public company to reach that figure. Nvidia <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/nvidia-4-trillion-market-value/">reached $4 trillion</a> back in July and is creeping closer to $5 trillion, while Microsoft also hit $4 trillion that same month before dropping down to a $3.9 trillion valuation, but it too has passed $4 trillion again this morning.

<br/>
Market capitalization is based on the total value of all outstanding Apple shares. We won't have an updated share count until Apple provides its earnings for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2025, so it is worth noting that the current market cap is not quite accurate. Apple's next earnings report will be shared on Thursday, October 30.

The new features include a brand new, refreshed design for tvOS 26, as well as two formats previously exclusive to the mobile version of the app – video podcasts and music videos.

Users should see a "switch to video" prompt that appears when a song being listened to also has an associated music video. Video versions of podcasts work similarly, with the added option to change playback speed.

<br/>
The current Camera Control button on iPhone 17 models uses both capacitive and pressure sensors beneath a sapphire crystal surface. The capacitive layer detects touch gestures, while the force sensor recognizes different pressure levels for taps, presses, and swipes.

<br/>
However, according to the Weibo-based account <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/QbbXB3KcV">Instant Digital</a>, Apple will remove the capacitive sensing layer and retain only pressure sensing recognition in the second iteration to achieve all Camera Control functions on the iPhone 18.

Apple's services unit is expected to deliver annual revenues of $108.6 billion in the year to last month, which is up around 13 percent from the previous year. That's according to analysts' estimates at Visible Alpha.

If the estimates prove accurate when Apple reports its Q4 fiscal results this week, Apple's services division will be larger than the entire annual sales of Disney or Tesla this year.

<p>”Tech is a pop culture. Very few of the decisions made in the industry are made rationally or empirically.

Infrastructure and stack decisions are made hedonistically – “cool” tech that makes the engineers and devs feel good about themselves almost always gets a priority over “boring” tech that has no risks.</p>
<p>The industry, especially the software side of tech, is driven by emotion and a sense of what is fashionable. There is genuinely more grounded engineering – materials, machinery, process, supply chains, etc. – taking place in the fashion industry than there ever has been in the software industry.”</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            For the 20th anniversary iPhone due in 2027, Apple is developing a solid-state button system as a wholesale replacement for the device's traditional mechanical buttons. That's the latest claim from Weibo account "Instant Digital," and it's not the first of its kind from the Chinese leaker.

However, the plan was reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/11/kuo-iphone-15-pro-no-solid-state-buttons-after-all/">canceled</a> at a late stage. They were then  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WhatsApp is developing a feature that will let users micro-manage the storage taken up by shared files in individual chat threads, greatly expanding the current storage management tools offered by the Meta-owned app.

<br/>
In its existing form, WhatsApp lets you manage storage globally by going to Settings ➝ Storage and Data ➝ Manage Storage, where files and media can be browsed from every conversation. 
<br/>
<br/>
There's also a "Media, Links, and Docs" option within each chat's info page where you can look at all of the shared files in a conversation, but it doesn't tell you how much space each file takes up.

To improve the situation, a new "Manage Storage" option has been added directly to the chat info page in the latest WhatsApp beta. As spotted by  [...]<br>

            <p>I solo played “Touch of Water” last night. It’s a good representation of the adventures in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncaged_(anthology)">the <em>Uncaged</em> series</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Claude did a good job adapting it my campaign setting and evolving the story. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusalka">rusalka</a> is a good monster - it’d make a good Eryines-like creature for Auril the Frostmaiden. You can recast Auril regionally, call her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morana_(goddess)">Marzanna or the like</a>, and then have a little frosty pantheon.</p>
<p>The story never resolves what happened to the drowned four year old boy that starts the adventure. An odd omission for a collection of adventures that are usually tightly sewed up by the end.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>Comparing China now to the US in the past isn&rsquo;t just a convenient rhetorical trick, it&rsquo;s arguably causal. While the full, more nuanced story deserves its own piece, the decline of the US&rsquo;s Rust Belt is definitely directly linked to the rise of China. A fate sealed by political decisions, primarily in the US, to go full &lsquo;free trade,&rsquo; which has meant factories leaving Ohio for Henan Province, where people work for less and companies can pollute more. Or as Wall Street called it, &ldquo;changes in policy, starting in the early 80s, but blossoming in the 90s, have allowed US companies to benefit from global labor and regulatory arbitrage, which has increased both their profits, size, and subsequent influence on labor, industrial, and regulatory policy.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>I grew up as a programmer in the 2000s, in Java culture. The aesthetics were about elegance, understandable simplicity (the opposite of the Perl obfuscation awards), and lots of DRY.</p>

<p>It will become even more so as one off vibe scripts and apps spread. If it&rsquo;s faster or just complete rewrite your code with AI, why bother to fix it?</p>
