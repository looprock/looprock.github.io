<br/>
While it is a minor spec-bump year for the MacBook Air, the new model does offer a few upgrades beyond the M4 chip. There is an improved 12-megapixel camera with support for <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111102">Center Stage</a>, support for two external displays even when the MacBook Air's lid is open, Thunderbolt 4 ports, and a new Sky Blue color option. And in the U.S., the latest-generation 13-inch MacBook Air now starts at $999, down from $1,099 previously.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When Apple released the second macOS 15.4 beta earlier this month, the company apparently made a change that means System Settings no longer shows how much local storage space Apple Intelligence features are taking up on a Mac.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
In macOS Sequoia 15.3.1, users with a Mac powered by Apple silicon can easily discover how much space any installed Apple Intelligence features are taking up on their drive by going to System Settings ➝ General ➝ Storage, and then clicking the circled "i" button next to macOS.
<br/>
<br/>
That hasn't been the case since the beta 2 release of Apple's upcoming macOS Sequoia 15.4 update. As <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1899233160858386432">spotted</a> by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris, when users click the "i" button, no further details are now given to explai [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is expected to release iOS 18.4 in early April, and when it does, users with HomeKit devices still running on the old Home app architecture may be forced to upgrade them to the latest software.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Apple has offered users the option to upgrade to new Home architecture since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/28/apple-makes-new-home-upgrade-available/">March 2023</a> when it released iOS 16.4, iPadOS 16.4, and macOS Ventura 13.3. At the time, Apple said the new architecture brings faster, more reliable performance, especially for smart homes with a lot of smart accessories installed. 
<br/>
<br/>
However, not all users were entirely convinced of its stability, mainly because it was actually the return of the update's availability after Apple temporarily &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/21/apple-pull [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Despite being released over two years ago, Apple's AirPods Pro 2 continue to dominate the wireless earbud market. However, with the AirPods Pro 3 expected to launch in 2025, anyone thinking of buying Apple's premium earbuds may be wondering if the next generation is worth holding out for.

<br/>
Apart from their audio and noise-canceling performance, which are generally regarded as excellent for such small buds, one of the reasons the AirPods Pro 2 have remained popular is Apple's commitment to updating their feature set with software updates. 
<br/>
<br/>
When iOS 17 was released in 2023, AirPods Pro 2 got new Adaptive Audio features, mute controls, and faster automatic device switching. And with iOS 18, released last year, Apple added <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-airpods-pro/">head gestures</a>, allowing [...]<br>
