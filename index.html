            <h1><em>Balancing Engineering Ambition with Product Realism</em></h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In July of 2023, Etsy’s App Updates team, responsible for the Updates feed in Etsy’s mobile apps, set off with an ambitious goal: to revamp the Updates tab to become Deals, a home for a shopper’s coupons and sales, in time for Cyber Week 2023.</p>
<p>The Updates tab had been around for years, and in the course of its evolution ended up serving multiple purposes. It was a hub for updates about a user’s favorite shops and listings, but it was also increasingly a place to start new shopping journeys. Not all updates were created equal. The most acted-upon updates in the tab were coupons offered for abandoned cart items, which shoppers loved.</p>
<p>We spotted an opportunity to clarify intentions for our users: by refactoring favorite-based updates into the Favorites tab, and (more boldly), by recentering Updates and transforming it into a hub for a buyer’s deals.</p>

To distribute apps through an app marketplace, with a reduced fee to Apple, or with an alternative payment option, developers have to opt in to new business terms that accept the Core Technology Fee and other new pricing mandates. Apple did not initially provide a way for developers to try the new system and then opt back out if it does not work out, but now there is a one-time term swap option available in some circumstances.
