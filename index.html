            <b>Summary:</b><br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple supplier TSMC has reached a preliminary agreement with Intel that will see TSMC operating Intel’s chipmaking facilities, reports <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/intel-tsmc-tentatively-agree-form-chipmaking-joint-venture">The Information</a></em>.

As part of the deal, TSMC may share some of its chip manufacturing methods with Intel, and train Intel employees to use them.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>

<br/>
Previously in iOS, opening a new tab and tapping the search field brought up the keyboard while continuing to display the personalized Safari home page. However, Apple's latest iOS 18.4 software update modifies how Safari handles new tabs by automatically showing your recent search history whenever someone taps into the search field.
