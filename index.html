            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today provided the second beta of the upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> update to its public beta testing group, allowing non-developers to test the new operating system ahead of its fall launch. The new beta comes a little over two weeks after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/12/macos-sonoma-public-beta-now-available/">released the first beta</a>.

<br/>
In addition to the new public beta, Apple has also released a revised version of the fourth developer beta, presumably to address issues that were resulting in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/25/macos-sonoma-beta-4-issues/">installation problems for some users</a> following last week's developer release.

<br/>
First, the report says that the idea of an ESPN app being preloaded on the iPhone would be appealing to Disney, but Apple has not offered a built-in iPhone app for a third-party brand since YouTube was removed as a pre-installed app on iOS 6 in 2012.
