            Back in June, we wrote about a ridiculously weak lawsuit from the big music publishers against exTwitter, claiming that the platform, mostly known for text, and which barely has any reasonable system for posting or listening to music, was a music piracy haven. As we noted, the publishers’ lawsuit seemed misguided in multiple ways, beyond [&#8230;]<br>

            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models are expected to feature a titanium frame instead of a stainless steel frame for the first time, and with the material swap, Apple is also focusing on new colors.

Back in July, we teamed up with Unknownz21 to reveal a new dark blue shade that Apple plans to use for the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌, and at that time, we also said that Apple has been testing a silver-gray shade and a space black color. <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/08/24/iphone-15-pro-titanium-no-gold/">9to5Mac</a></em> today said that it has also heard that Apple will be introducing a new dark blue color, which will be joined by silver, space black, and a natural titanium shade.

According to Astropad, Rock Paper Pencil is meant to have "unmatched realism" thanks to the combination of the custom ‌Apple Pencil‌ tip and screen protector engineered to match.

It snaps onto an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and can be removed when not needed for writing purposes.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Developing a successful MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is crucial for startups, offering market validation and fundraising opportunities. MVPs minimize risks by introducing basic product versions for user feedback. They facilitate fundraising by showcasing proof-of-concept and potential revenue. Various MVP types include Concierge, Wizard of Oz, Piecemeal, Single-feature, and Landing page. MVP development involves three stages: Pre-MVP groundwork, Prototype creation, and Minimum (Commercially) Viable Product launch. Dos: Swift testable launch, focus on core features, strategic experimentation. Don'ts: Overspending, over-reliance on outsourcing, overcomplicating, rushing to scale. Building an MVP is a continuous, iterative process, crucial to Lean Startup methodology, and a starting point on the product journey.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Biomedical knowledge is immense and growing quickly. The publicly available knowledge is disconnected - it is impossible to identify patterns/associations hidden deep within such disconnected knowledge. A company's internal knowledge is disconnected from it too. This presents significant challenge for scientists in the biomedical industry because they:

1) Miss important and potentially relevant knowledge
2) Unable to stay up to date or keep up with new knowledge
3) Decisions are made without the advantage of complete insights

At NExTNet, we are building the best-in-class Generative/Language AI stack to enable scientists to identify patterns hidden deep within disparate and multi-modal datasets, ranging from scientific papers and clinical trial reports to gene sequencing and protein expression atlases -- so that they can quickly find leads buried in mountains of information.<br>

The move, spotted by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveMoser/status/1694341869876986059?s=20">Steve Moser</a>, is currently in beta testing in the Testflight version of the app. Currently the change is optional, enabling users to set the URL bar to the top or bottom by pressing and holding the bar to bring up a switch, or by changing the location via Settings -&gt; Address Bar.

Apple in its iOS 15 beta testing phase introduced a redesigned Safari experience that moved the URL bar and tab interface to the bottom of the iPhone, a decision that initially proved controversial with ‌iPhone‌ users.

            All iPhone 15 models this year are expected to adopt USB-C ports for the first time, and while USB-C has several advantages over Lightning, another rumor today suggests that Apple's standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models are unlikely to enjoy any increase in data transfer speeds following the transition.
