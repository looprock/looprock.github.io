            Apple is working on a new Home accessory that is designed to serve as a central hub or "Command Center" for smart home management. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> are already home hubs and almost all Apple devices can control a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> setup, but Apple is designing an all-in-one home management product to make control even easier.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Repair site iFixit today shared a teardown video of the M4 Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a>, giving us a look inside of the machine. Apple didn't make any external design changes to the ‌MacBook Pro‌ models, but iFixit was hopeful for repairability improvements.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the M4 Pro ‌MacBook Pro‌ that iFixit took apart was almost identical to the M3 ‌MacBook Pro‌, which means Apple kept almost the same internal design as well.
<br/>
<br/>
The M4 Pro ‌MacBook Pro‌ has a larger heatsink than the M3 ‌MacBook Pro‌ for improved heat dissipation, but the battery build and size are the same. Removing the battery still requires removing the trackpad because the battery's adhesive tabs are under the trackpad hardware. Getting to the logic board is "incredibly complex and tedious" due to all the screws and the cables that are in the way.

Apple previously announced that new "Silo" episodes would be released on Fridays, but the third episode of the second season will instead be released on Wednesday, November 27.

"Silo" follows the last 10,000 people on Earth, all of whom live in a massive underground bunker to escape the seemingly toxic and deadly world outside. The people are unaware of why the silo was built, and those who seek the truth face deadl [...]<br>

Originally <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/16/eu-opens-investigations-app-store-apple-pay/">launched in June 2020</a>, the investigation was sparked by a complaint from Rakuten's Kobo subsidiary.

<br/>
In its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-publishes-provisional-findings-in-mobile-browsers-and-cloud-gaming-market-investigation">report</a>, the CMA's independent inquiry group determined that Apple's Safari browser policies prevent competing browsers from implementing certain features, such as faster webpage loading technologies.

In this episode, we explore the powerful concept of ARC (Atomic Reference Counting) and its critical role in managing shared resources in multithreaded Rust programs. By leveraging ARC, developers can safely share ownership of data across threads without relying on a traditional garbage collector, enabling efficient, flexible, and scalable concurrency.
