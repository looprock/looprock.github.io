            Despite being released over two years ago, Apple's AirPods Pro 2 continue to dominate the wireless earbud market. However, with the AirPods Pro 3 expected to launch sometime in 2025, anyone thinking of buying Apple's premium earbuds may be wondering if the next generation is worth holding out for.

<br/>
Apart from their audio and noise-canceling performance, which are generally regarded as excellent for such small buds, one of the reasons the AirPods Pro 2 have remained popular is Apple's commitment to updating their feature set with software updates. 
<br/>
<br/>
When iOS 17 was released last year, AirPods Pro 2 got new Adaptive Audio features, mute controls, and faster automatic device switching. And with iOS 18, released last month, Apple added <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-airpods-pro/">head gestures&lt;/</a> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When you shoot video on iPhone 16 models, multiple formats like Spatial Audio and Stereo are recorded to allow more audio customization. If you record video with Spatial Audio turned on, you can later edit the video sound — to reduce background noise to focus on the person speaking on camera, for example.

<br/>
Spatial Audio is automatically enabled on all iPhone 16 models when you record video. Spatial Audio produces a more realistic and immersive audio recording, but it also allows you to edit the sound of your video later in the Photos app using the new Audio Mix feature.

Audio Mix uses machine learning to identify and separate background audio and speech, allowing you to choose one of the following options to remix your video's sound:

            Apple's budget-friendly iPhone SE is set for a major overhaul with a fourth generation model expected to launch in spring 2025.

            One of the major new software-based camera features in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models is support for a wider range of Photographic Styles, complete with more granular controls to make for a setup where you can create a customized look for all of your images.

            Verizon is currently experiencing a major outage that is affecting many customers across the U.S., including iPhone users. Affected users may be unable to send or receive phone calls, send or receive text messages, or use cellular data.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iOS 18 update brings powerful new search functions to the Photos app, allowing you to find specific images with unprecedented precision. Here's how to make the most of its new capabilities.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961382" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-Photos-Feature-Chromatic.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
In iOS 18, the key to effective searching in Photos is using natural language. Instead of simple keywords, try describing the photo you're looking for in detail. The app can now understand complex queries and find images based on specific elements within them.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you've previously identified friends and family using the People and Pets features, you can search for "Dad smiling" or "Snowy sleeping." The more specific you are, the better your results will be. You can even search for actions or emotions, like "kids laughing at swings" or "couple dancing at wedding."

Apple last week removed the iPhone apps for Beddit models 3.0 and 3.5 from the App Store, according to <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/">Aaron Perris</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/05/09/apple-acquires-sleep-monitor-beddit/">acquired Beddit in 2017</a>, and it has gradually reduced hardware and software capabilities and support for the accessory since. Apple removed cloud syncing from the original Beddit app in 2018, released an updated version of the accessory <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/apple-beddit-3-5-sleep-monitor/">with fewer features</a> in 2019, and stopped selling the accessory entirely in 2022.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>We recently spent a sprint focused on reducing our Snowflake costs. During this sprint, we investigated 22 of our most expensive pipelines (in terms of Snowflake costs), one by one. In total we merged 56 changes, and in this post we’ll be laying out the optimisations that worked best for us.</p><p>Most of these changes were just common sense and didn’t involve any advanced data engineering techniques. Still, we’re always making mistakes (and that’s okay!) and hopefully this post will help readers avoid a few of the pitfalls we encountered.</p><blockquote>⚠️ Medium is now 14 years old. Our team has inherited a tech stack that has a long history, some flaws and technical debt. Our approach to this problem was pragmatic; we’re not trying to suggest big pipeline re-designs to reach a perfect state, but rather consider our tech stack in it’s current state and figure out the best options to cut costs quickly. Our product evolves, and as we create new things we can remove some old ones, which is why we don’t need</blockquote> [...]<br>
