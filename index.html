<p id="Cr5znI">Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, is making progress on adding multimodal inputs to its Grok chatbot, according to <a href="https://developers.x.ai/python-sdk/sampler/">public developer documents</a>. What this means is that, soon, users may be able to upload photos to Grok and receive text-based answers.</p>
<p id="gQ5KzD">This was first teased in <a href="https://x.ai/blog/grok-1.5v">a blog post</a> last month from xAI which said Grok-1.5V will offer “multimodal models in a number of domains.” The latest update to the developer documents appear to show progress on shipping a new model.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Multiple celebrities have been spotted with a new version of the Beats Pill speaker, and today the device showed up in an FCC database, suggesting that we're getting closer to a potential launch.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949043" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/beats-pill-f1-daniel-ricciardo.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
FCC filings typically happen just weeks ahead of when a product launches, so we could see this new Beats Pill speaker sometime in June. Apple plans to launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-buds-announced/">Solo Buds earphones</a> in June, so the Pill could launch around the same timeframe.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple has clearly provided these Beats Pill speakers to a number of sports stars and celebrities to create hype for it, and the speaker has been seen with basketball star LeBron James, F1 driver Daniel Ricciardo, soccer star Lionel Messi, and Kim Kardashian.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today filed a pre-motion letter seeking to dismiss the antitrust case that the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) levied against Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/21/apple-sued-by-us-department-of-justice/">back in March</a>.

<br/>
In the pre-motion letter, Apple says that the government's lawsuit is flawed in multiple ways, and has not successfully alleged that Apple is a monopoly power in the relevant market, proven anticompetitive conduct, or demonstrated consumer harm. From Apple's filing:
<br/>
<blockquote>This case lies well beyond the outer limits of antitrust law. A Section 2 Sherman Act claim can move past the pleadings only if the complaint alleges (1) monopoly power in a relevant market; (2) anticompetitive conduct; and (3) anticompetitive effects. [...]
