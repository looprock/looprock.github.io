            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 16:09:55-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Along with a foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, Apple is working on a larger foldable device that's somewhere around 19 inches, but rumors have been split on whether it's an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> or a Mac. Some reports refer to the device as an ‌iPad‌, while some call it a Mac, and the split seems to come down to the operating system on the device.

<br/>
<h2>Is it a Mac?</h2>
<br/>
Some rumors have suggested that Apple is developing a foldable MacBook with an all-display design. The MacBook already has a foldable design, of course, but the difference here would be a single display without an included keyboard and trackpad.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 15:55:41-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today stopped signing iOS 18.3.1, so <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users who have upgraded to iOS 18.3.2 are no longer able to downgrade to the prior version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>. Apple released iOS 18.3.2 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/11/apple-releases-ios-18-3-2/">on March 10</a>.
<br/>

<br/>
It is not unusual for Apple to stop signing older versions of iOS after releasing an update. Software that is not signed cannot be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side verification check, and it keeps ‌iPhone‌ users from installing outdated versions of iOS. ‌iPhone‌ models compatible with ‌iOS 18‌ are only eligible to download and run iOS 18.3.2 at this time.

There are now several sources who agree that Apple's first foldable iPhone will feature a 7.8-inch inner display when unfolded, along with a 5.5-inch outer display.

            Two new PebbleOS smartwatches <a href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/introducing-two-new-pebbleos-watches">were announced today</a> by original Pebble watch creator Eric Migicovsky, revitalizing a Kickstarter-launched brand that had three years of mega popularity before it folded in 2016.

Called the Core 2 Duo and the Core Time 2, the two smartwatches run a PebbleOS, which is based on the source code for the software that ran on the original Pebble smartwatch. After Pebble shut down, assets were acquired by Fitbit, which was then acquired by Google. Google agreed to open source PebbleOS earlier this year, paving the way for the return of Pebble watches.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Have you noticed your iPhone videos keep playing on repeat in the Photos app? Since Apple's iOS 18.2 update, the stock Photos app automatically replays videos until you manually pause them – a feature that might be fine at first but can quickly become annoying, especially with longer clips.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-897381" height="470" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/icloud-photos.jpg" width="836"/>
<br/>
The auto-loop feature can be fun for short clips or when showing someone a quick video, but it forces you to take action to stop each video rather than letting it end naturally. It can be disruptive when you're browsing through multiple short clips in your library, and proves particularly annoying when viewing longer content where you likely don't want to see the same three-minute video play twice in a row.

Fortunately, Apple provides a simple toggle to disable the behavior:
