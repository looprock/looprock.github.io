            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            As we reported last week, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/iphone-15-pro-models-more-repairable/">more repairable internal design</a>, with a redesigned frame that allows for the back glass panel to be easily removed from the devices. This change was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/19/ifixit-iphone-14-teardown/">first made to the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus</a> last year, and now it extends to the Pro models this year.

At the time, we said that the removable back glass would likely result in significantly lower repair fees for iPhone 15 Pro models with cracked back glass for customers without AppleCare+ coverage, and this is now confirmed.

            iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro models are capable of up to 27W peak charging speeds with an appropriate USB-C power adapter, according to <a href="https://www.macotakara.jp/iphone/entry-45309.html">Japanese blog <em>Mac Otakara</em></a>. It is unclear where the website sourced this information from, but it seems to confirm that the iPhone 15 Pro models have the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/18/iphone-14-and-14-pro-charging-speeds/">same maximum charging speeds as the iPhone 14 Pro models</a>.

However, he said demand for the iPhone 15 Pro is weaker than it was for the iPhone 14 Pro so far, which he believes could be the result of more customers choosing to buy the Pro Max model this year.

            Apple quietly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-magsafe-battery-pack-and-duo/">discontinued the MagSafe Battery Pack and MagSafe Duo Charger</a> immediately after unveiling four new iPhone 15 models with a USB-C port last week. Both accessories were equipped with a Lightning connector.

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-807695" height="1587" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/magsafe-battery-pack-feature.jpg" width="2820"/>
<br/>
Apple has not commented on why the MagSafe accessories were removed from sale, but the move was not surprising given the company is transitioning away from Lightning. The big question is, will they ever return with USB-C ports?

As noted <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/16/magsafe-battery-pack-and-duo-charger">by <em>Daring Fireball</em>'s John Gruber</a>, Apple has often released battery packs months after new iPhones. Apple released Smart Battery Cases for the iPhone 6s [...]<br>

This information was recently confirmed by Google spokesperson Bridget Starkey to <em>The Verge</em>. Starkey stated, "At this moment, we don't have any repair option for the Google Pixel Watch.

            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup noticeably lacks a model with a display size below six inches, just two years after Apple extolled the virtues of a 5.4-inch device.

<br/>
Apple debuted the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12 mini</a> in 2020 following years of calls from ‌iPhone‌ fans for the company to offer a small-screen device with the latest features.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            During Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/everything-apple-announced-fall-2023-event/">"Wonderlust" event</a> earlier this week, Apple claimed that the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ camera system "pushes the limits of what you can capture with a smartphone." It was a reference to the device's support for "spatial computing video," but the mention was brief and lacking detail.
<br/>

<br/>
For those who missed it, spatial video is Apple's name for what is essentially 3D video. The iPhone 15 Pro is able to record spatial videos natively by combining video captured by the sensors of the Main and Ultra Wide cameras, which results in something akin to stereoscopic video.
<br/>
<br/>
This 3D video can then be played back using Apple's "spatial computing" Vision Pro headset when it's released early next year, allowing users to r [...]<br>
