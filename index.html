            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            This year, Apple tweaked iPhone 16 Pro screen sizes to make them bigger than 2023's iPhone 15 Pro models, and next year we are also expecting a change in the size of the displays in the iPhone 17 lineup. Here's what we know.

<br/>
<h2>Standard iPhone 17</h2>
<br/>
Apple could introduce a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/22/iphone-17-lineup-specs-detail-upgrades/">new display size</a> for the standard iPhone 17 model in 2025. The iPhone 17 could measure in at 6.3 inches, up from 6.1 inches, which would make it the same size as the current iPhone 16 Pro. At 6.3 inches, it would be in between the size of the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 and the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus. However, next year there may be only one non-Pro model in Apple's lineup (see below).

iOS 18.2.1 should be a minor update that fixes bugs and/or addresses security vulnerabilities, but it is unclear which specific issues might be resolved. The update will likely be released in late December or early January.
<br/>
<br/>
There could be accompanying updates, such as macOS 15.2.1, but we have not confirmed that.

iOS 18.2.1 will follow iOS 18.2, which was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/apple-releases-ios-18-2-update/">released earlier this month</a>. iOS 18.2 introduced more Apple Intelligence features for iPhone 15 Pro models and all iPhone 1 [...]<br>

            Apple plans to release a new "HomePod" with a 7-inch LCD display, an A18 chip, and Apple Intelligence support in 2025, according <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20241216PD218/apple-supply-chain-display-lcd-boe.html">to <em>DigiTimes</em></a>.

It is unclear how much the screen-equipped HomePod would cost, but Apple is seemingly aiming for a reasonable price. In a paywalled report this week, the supply chain publication said Apple has selected China-based manufacturer Tianma to supply the LCD panels for the device, at an "exceptionally competitive" price of $10 per panel. The low cost of this component would likely contribute to the device being more affordable.
