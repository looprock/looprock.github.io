<br/>
If you have a compatible iPhone model with a LiDAR Scanner (see the list below), you can measure a person's height in Apple's built-in Measure app. This way, you can see how much your nieces and nephews have grown since you last saw them, or find out if your favorite uncle is as tall as he claims he is. This might sound silly (it totally is!), but many people have no idea that iPhones offer this neat little feature.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Steps</h2><ol><li>Open the Measure app.</li>
<br/>
<li>Make sure the person is visible on your iPhone's screen from head to toe.</li>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's position as the dominant force in the global true wireless stereo (TWS) earbud market is expected to continue through 2025, according to <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/tws-market-entering-maturity-poised-for-moderate-growth-through-2028/">Counterpoint Research</a>.

<br/>
The forecast outlines a 3% year-over-year increase in global TWS unit shipments for 2025, signaling a transition from rapid growth to a more mature phase for the category. While Apple is set to remain the leading brand by revenue and brand recognition, the report suggests that volume growth will be led by lower-priced models under $50 from other brands, driven by emerging markets and replacement demand.
