            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is working on a new version of the Powerbeats earbuds called the Powerbeats Fit, and the company shared a teaser video of the upcoming earbuds on its YouTube channel.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The Powerbeats Fit look similar to the Beats Fit Pro, featuring a small in-ear earbud with a silicone wingtip that secures them in the ear. "Fit for every move," reads the tagline of Apple's video.
<br/>
<br/>
The Powerbeats Fit could have some of the same features as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/powerbeats-pro/">Powerbeats Pro</a> 2, such as heart rate sensing and Active Noise Cancellation.
<br/>
<br/>
Little is known about the Powerbeats Fit right now, but Apple says they are coming in fall 2025. Fall 2025 technically begins on September 22, so we could see them sometime after Apple's September 9 iPhone-centric event.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/">Beats</a></div><br/>This article, " [...]<br>

<br/>
Apple's Crossbody Strap reportedly features an unusual magnetic design; it likely has a "flexible metal core" that makes it magnetic along its entire length. At the ends, "rings polarized oppositely to the strap close the system." The design eliminates the need for conventional hooks or loops.
<br/>
<br/>
Samples of the Crossbody Strap are apparently made from a woven nylon material similar to the Apple Watch's Sport Loop bands. Apple may also introduce a silicone variant.

            Apple's iOS 26 update brings an unexpected camera trick to AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 – the ability to control iPhone photo and video capture using AirPods stem gestures.

Last month, <em>Macworld</em>'s Filipe Espósito reported that orange and dark blue would be two out of the five <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/16/all-new-iphone-17-and-17-pro-colors-leaked/">color options available for the iPhone 17 Pro models</a>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If you've been interrupted by your iPhone's Wallet app with unwanted promotional alerts, here's some good news: In iOS 26, currently in beta, Apple has listened to complaints and added a simple toggle to silence these marketing messages for good.

<br/>
The new toggle comes after widespread complaints this summer when Apple pushed unwanted notifications about F1 movie ticket offers through the Wallet app. Many iPhone owners <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/24/apple-wallet-notification-f1-movie-ad/">felt blindsided by the advertising</a>, especially since Wallet handles important financial information which makes disabling all notifications impractical.
