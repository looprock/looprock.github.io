<br/>
While app icons will likely remain locked to an invisible grid system on the Home Screen, to ensure there is some uniformity, our sources say that users will be able to arrange icons more freely on iOS 18. For example, we expect that the update will introduce the ability to create blank spaces, rows, and columns between app icons.

Here’s three talks from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2Me-TpMQFvCphDu_xm71ed_">the Platform Engineering Day</a> that I really liked. They’re primarily focused on what I’d call designing and product managing a platform. I’m a fan of the “platform as a product” notion - I came across it around 2016 or so at Pivotal and saw many organizations apply it. These three videos are in that general area: how do you build a good product that application developers will want to use and “get value” out of, not just deliver IT capabilities and services.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhloarnpxVo" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp"/><img height="374" src="https://cote.io/src" width="662"/><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>They’re worth watching all the wa</p> [...]<br>
