With the introduction of the M3 series, encompassing the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips, Apple once again set new benchmarks in performance, efficiency, and capabilities for the Mac. The transition from ‌M2‌ to M3 is marked by significant enhancements, primarily thanks to Apple's move to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> process, among other key architectural improvements such as a completely redesigned GPU.

            <p><a class="txt2html" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-datetime.html" style="text-decoration: none;">TIMESTAMP</a>s are very precise and flexible in Postgres, but sometimes users want to do index lookups of TIMESTAMP values with
less precision, i.e., by date.  To illustrate this, let's create a sample table with 100k TIMESTAMP values:
</p>
<p><blockquote>
</p><pre class="quote_explicit">
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE date_test (event_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE);
 
INSERT INTO date_test
SELECT
(
    SELECT '2023-03-01 00:00:00'::timestamptz +
           (floor(random() *
            (extract(EPOCH FROM '2023-04-01'::timestamptz) -
             extract(EPOCH FROM '2023-03-01'::timestamptz)) +
            b * 0)::integer || 'seconds')::interval
)
FROM <strong>generate_series</strong>(1, <strong>100000</strong>) AS a(b);
 
ANALYZE date_test;

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            This week on we’re joined by Emil Sjölander from Figma — talking about bringing Dev Mode to Figma. Dev Mode is their new workspace in Figma that’s designed to bring developers and design to the same tool. The question they’re trying to answer is “How do you create a home for developers in a design tool?” We go way back to Emil’s startup that was acquired by Figma called Visly, how we iterated to here from 20 years ago (think PSD > HTML days), what they did to build Dev Mode, what they’re doing around codegen, the popularity of design systems, and what it takes to go from zero to Dev Mode.<br>
