            <b>Published:</b> 2025-05-12 04:05:25-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is developing a new feature that will synchronize captive Wi-Fi portal login information across devices, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-11/apple-2027-plans-tabletop-robot-20th-anniversary-iphone-ios-19-wi-fi-feature"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

<br/>
The system will allow users to enter login details for captive Wi-Fi networks – commonly found in hotels, airports, and coffee shops – just once, then automatically sync that information across their iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices.
<br/>
<br/>
"When you go to a new hotel, office building or gym, you're often asked to fill out a web form on all your devices before you can access the internet," Gurman reports. "This new feature will let you enter that information on one device and have it synched to your other products."

<br/>
The cameras are expected to scan the environment and describe objects, similar to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/visual-intelligence/">Visual Intelligence</a> feature on newer iPhones.

            Apple is considering raising prices for its upcoming iPhone 17 models set to release this fall, according to people familiar with the matter cited by <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-iphone-price-increase-2eaebb14">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>.

<br/>
The company reportedly aims to pair the potential price hikes with new features and design changes to justify the increased cost to consumers, rather than attributing them to U.S. tariffs on goods from China.
<br/>
<br/>
The U.S. and China recently agreed to suspend most tariffs imposed during their trade dispute, but a 20% tariff implemented by President Trump on Chinese goods remains in place and covers smartphones.

            Apple's former Chief Design Officer Jony Ive has given a rare and wide-ranging interview at Stripe Sessions 2025, offering new insights into his design philosophy, his time at Apple, and his current work at his design collective, LoveFrom.

In a one-hour conversation with Stripe co-founder Patrick Collison, Ive reflected on the personal and professional experiences that have shaped his career, beginning with his early exposure to Apple products as a student in the UK. Recalling his first encounter with the original Macintosh, Ive described it as a transformative moment that revealed the values of its creators.
<br/>

"What we make stands testament to who we are," he said. He characterized the Mac as a "bicycle for the mind," a phrase popularized by Steve Jobs, and noted how it inspired his eventual relocation to California in the early 1990s.

This new feature makes tracking Bluetooth devices a lot more difficult because it randomizes the timing of device address changes, instead of just using predictable intervals. It also offloads address change operations to the controller device, which should help extend the battery life of the accessory device.
