            <p>Yes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kubernetes started as a way to orchestrate containers, but its true innovation lies in its API model. The declarative resource pattern, with its desired state, actual state and continuous reconciliation, has proven to be a universal abstraction. It works for workloads, infrastructure, policies and more. That universality is why Kubernetes has become the foundation for IDPs. It provides a consistent way to define, extend and enforce platform building blocks. Whether you’re provisioning a cloud database, managing a network policy or applying compliance rules, Kubernetes APIs make platforms programmable, predictable and composable. This API-first foundation also makes Kubernetes uniquely ready for the AI era. Agents and large language models (LLMs) don’t navigate dashboards or tribal knowledge; they interact with APIs. And Kubernetes offers a consistent, structured interface designed from Day 1 for machine-to-machine communication.”</p>
