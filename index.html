Yesterday, we reported that the new Mac mini <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/08/m4-mac-mini-modular-storage/">features modular storage</a>, and YouTube channel dosdude1 has already opened up the base model and upgraded its storage capacity from 256GB to 1TB. The steps included removing the original NAND storage chips from the board with a heat gun, preparing the new NAND chips by reballing them, soldering the new NAND chips to the board, and restoring the Mac mini in DFU Mode.

<br/>
While those steps are impractical for the average customer, the video proves that storage in the new Mac mini can technically be upgraded without having to pay for Apple's overpriced storage upgrade options when or [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has returned to using two 128GB storage chips in the new Mac mini with 256GB of storage, according to a <a href="https://x.com/ohgkg/status/1854859167213011199">partial teardown video</a> shared on social media today. This means the base-model Mac mini with the M4 chip will not have significantly slower SSD speeds compared to higher-end configurations of the computer with 512GB, 1TB, or 2TB of storage, as multiple NAND chips allows for faster SSD read and write speeds.

The teardown video also reveals that storage is modular in the new Mac mini, meaning that it can be easily removed since it is not soldered down.
