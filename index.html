            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Over the years, Apple has switched from an aluminum frame to a stainless steel frame to a titanium frame for its highest-end iPhones. And now, it has been rumored that Apple will go back to using aluminum for three out of four iPhone 17 models.

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990412" height="2160" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iphone-17-pro-asherdipps.jpg" width="3840"/>
<br/>
In an investor note with research firm GF Securities, obtained by <em>MacRumors</em> this week, Apple supply chain analyst Jeff Pu said the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will all be equipped with aluminum frames. Interestingly, though, he expects Apple's rumored iPhone 17 Air model to have a titanium frame.
<br/>
<br/>
This would be a notable change for the Pro models, as all of the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro models have titanium frames, resulting in the devices weighing less than iPhone 14 Pro models with heavier stainless steel frames.

Samsung's "M" series of OLED panels are made for flagship smartphones, while "14" refers to the number of high-performance materials used to produce them. The "M14" panel was used in last year's Apple's iPhone 16 Pro models, and delivers a 30% increase in brightness along with improved longevity compared to the previous M13 panel, thanks to improvements in the efficiency of the blue-emitting layer.

            Apple is set to "significantly change" the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s design language later this year, according to a Weibo leaker.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-990003" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-17-Roundup-Feature-2.jpg" width="2500"/>

In a new post, the user known "<a href="https://weibo.com/u/6048569942">Digital Chat Station</a>" said that the ‌iPhone‌'s design is "starting to change significantly" this year. The "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>" reportedly features a "horizontal, bar-shaped" design on the rear, likely referring to an elongated camera bump. On the other hand, the Pro models purportedly adopt a "large horizontal matrix design."

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-17 07:05:00-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In macOS, the Hot Corners feature turns each of the four corners of your screen into a designated action, allowing you to quickly access certain functions built into the system, such as Mission Control, Notification Center, the Screen Saver, QuickNote, and more. Many Mac users would agree, there's something satisfying about bringing up these commonly used functions with a simple, swift cursor movement. 
<br/>

<br/>
What isn't so satisfying, however, is accidentally triggering a Hot Corner, which can lead to all kinds of unintended desktop behavior - like application windows flying all over the place. This can happen when you lose track of the mouse cursor, or when you're working within the confines of a smaller MacBook screen. Thankfully, there's a way to tame wayward Hot Corners using modifier keys. Here's how.
