            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, Apple Maps has a feature called Visited Places that when enabled automatically logs where you've been, with the aim of making it easier to revisit your favorite spots or to share locations with friends. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1011313" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iOS-26-Maps-Glass.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
While it can be useful for tracking your travels, you might prefer to keep your location history private. Here's how to disable the feature and clear your history.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>What Is Visited Places?</h2>
<br/>
Visited Places keeps a record of locations you've visited, organizing them by category such as restaurants, shops, or transit stops. The feature is end-to-end encrypted, so Apple can't read your data, and it syncs across all your Apple devices signed into the same account.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-02 07:26:58-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Nearly two weeks after the iPhone 17 series launched, analysts at investment banking firm Morgan Stanley said demand for the devices has been "modestly stronger than we originally expected," based on a combination of extended shipping estimates on Apple's online store and information it gathered from Apple's supply chain.

<br/>
There has been strong early demand for the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max, according to the analysts. However, they said the ultra-thin iPhone Air has faced "relative weakness" in demand so far.
<br/>
<br/>
"Our supply chain checks suggest an iPhone 17 build increase is likely imminent," wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring, in a research note today. In the second half of 2025, Apple's supply chain might increase its production of the new iPhones to more than 90 mil [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-01 08:55:25-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iFixit today disassembled the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a>, giving us a look at what's inside and how the ‌AirPods Pro 3‌ have changed in comparison to the AirPods Pro 2. 
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Apple designed the ‌AirPods Pro 3‌ with a new foam-infused tip, and the design change is mainly visible under a microscope. You can see a small layer of foam at the top of the earbud where it meets the ear. 
<br/>
<br/>
The AirPods have a 0.221 Wh battery cell inside, while the case has a single 1.334 Wh battery. The AirPods Pro 2 had two battery cells inside the case, and the change explains why we're down to 24 hours of battery life from the case instead of 30 hours like the AirPods Pro 2. 
<br/>
<br/>
The case has fewer rare earth magnets inside, but they've been placed in different locations to ensure that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> and Qi 2 charging still works as expected.

            The all-new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> comes in four distinct color options, so which should you choose? 
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
With its ultra-thin titanium frame, large display, and glass back, the ‌iPhone Air‌ takes a different aesthetic direction from the rest of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> lineup. This year's finishes emphasize lightness and subtle sophistication, reflecting the phone's positioning as Apple's thinnest and most design-focused device. 
<br/>
<br/>
Both Apple's frosted and bumper cases noticeably show the device's color. The Air's full-width camera plateau draws attention to the device's color even with a case, making it all the more important to choose wisely.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>”Prioritize sovereignty where it matters most. Not every workload requires sovereign infrastructure — and overengineering can be costly and inefficient. Focus on areas where sovereignty is critical: AI workloads, sensitive data, and operations in regulated industries. Use edge computing to process data locally and reduce compliance risks. Localized cloud options, including sovereign clouds and regional vendors, can help meet legal requirements without compromising agility. A surgical approach to sovereignty ensures strategic alignment and cost-effectiveness.”</p>

            <p>Smoked brisket in London from Smokoloko. It wasn’t too great, but I had some travel salt packets, so added enough salt to make it OK. They seemed to have some end-pieces which looked better, but I ordered “brisket” thinking I’d get slices.</p>
