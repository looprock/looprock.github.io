The Mute key, a staple on Mac keyboards since the PowerBook G3 'Lombard' debuted in 1999, has finally received a logical redesign on the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> with M4 chip.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has increased the thickness of the upcoming iPhone 17 Pro Max compared to the current generation iPhone 16 Pro Max, claims the Chinese leaker known as <a href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/PhqFQjY5b">Ice Universe</a>.

<br/>
Apple is said to have increased the depth of the iPhone 17 Pro Max to 8.725mm, up from 8.25mm on the iPhone 16 Pro Max, which would be a 0.475mm difference in thickness. The increase "surely means a larger battery," according to the leaker. Apart from depth, the iPhone 17 Pro Max's frame reportedly <a href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/PhqQrs9PB">remains unchanged</a>, and is otherwise identical to the iPhone 16 Pro Max.

Posting to their <a href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/PhqSED0hS">Weibo account</a>, the Chinese leaker today claimed that the iPhone 17 Air and iPhone 17 Pro Max have identical body length, width, screen size, and bezels.
