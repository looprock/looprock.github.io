<br/>
The claim centers on an agreement from October 2018, from which point it is alleged that Amazon restricted third-party sellers from offering Apple products on Amazon's marketplace, while Apple gave Amazon better wholesale terms for Apple products sold directly by Amazon as a retailer.

<br/>
As a result of these changes, the report said the iPhone 18 Pro models will not have a pill-shaped Dynamic Island cutout at the top of the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, the devices will look similar to the iPhone 17 Pro models, the report said.

<br/>
Apple is also planning to add a mechanical iris to at least one rear camera on the iPhone 18 Pro models, enabling variable aperture, according to the report.

In its latest projection for the smartphone market next year, the firm has downgraded its forecast from a previously expected 0.45% growth, citing a memory shortage that has pushed component costs up 10% to 25%. Chinese brands like Honor and Oppo are said to face greater pressure due to lower profit margins, particularly in the entry-level segment where costs have jumped 20% to 30% since early 2025.

In some cases, it's obvious what the feature flags are referring to, while some are more vague and harder to interpret. We've included the feature flag and a short explanation of what it might reference, but keep in mind that Apple doesn't provide full explanations because this is all internal code.

<br/>
As it turns out, an Apple prototype device running an early build of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> was sold, and the person who bought it shared the software. The OS has a version number of 23A5234w, and the first developer beta of ‌iOS 26‌ was 23A5260n, so it dates back to before that initial beta. Apple was still calling it iOS 19 internally at that time, so the software is labeled iOS 19 rather than ‌iOS 26‌.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-12-15 12:06:29-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 26.3 adds a new "Notification Forwarding" setting that allows incoming notifications on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to be forwarded to a third-party device.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030197" height="1189" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/ios-26-3-notification-forwarding.jpg" width="2114"/>
<br/>
The setting is located in the Notification section of the Settings app under a new "Notification Forwarding" option. Apple says that notifications can only be forwarded to a single device at a time, so if Notification Forwarding is enabled with a third-party wearable, the Apple Watch won't able to receive and display notifications.
<br/>
<br/>
Users can choose to have a device receive notifications only from selected apps rather than all apps, and notifications will include the name of the app and all content contained in the notification. This is a feature that is only available to those living in Europe.

The garbage collector quietly does its job, and unlike C or C++, we rarely think about malloc or free. This doesn’t mean that there are no memory leaks in Python.

You might not notice it at first, until your worker starts OOM-ing, latency creeps up, or container restarts become mysteriously frequent.</p><p>In this post, we’ll share the story of a real-world memory leak we encountered during a Python upgrade — how we discovered it, the tools and techniques we used to investigate, and the lessons we learned.</p><h3>What happened after upgrading to Python 3.10?</h3> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Enterprises have a habit of &ldquo;professionalizing&rdquo; consumer tech by adding control - security, compliance, cost management, approved architectures. All reasonable. And often exactly what kills the thing.</p>
<p>Heroku and early cloud worked because they <em>removed</em> friction: no tickets, no permission, no approved stack. Developers could move fast, make local tradeoffs, and live with the consequences.</p>
<p>Enterprise adoption usually means re-introducing the friction the tech was designed to eliminate. It&rsquo;s called maturity. It feels like regression.</p>
<p>When you make the goose enterprise-grade, you often kill the goose.</p>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-12-15 10:18:03+01:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Eventually, software is very hard to change. There are numerous reasons for this, and they often don’t even involve the software. The systems that run the software are old, regulators don’t let you change things, security controls, people have just forgotten how to program COBOL. There is so much code that it’s hard to know what the code does.</p>
<p>So when you want to change it, you don’t know what to do. The ultimate sign of legacy software is that you don’t know how to test it after making changes. If you can’t test software, you can’t safely make changes, the Michael Feathers definition of legacy code.</p>
<p>I could get distracted by discussing the reasons, but we all know that <a href="https://cote.io/legacytrap/">software just becomes “legacy” at some point</a>.</p>
<p>This means that you have to figure out building software that will be valuable in the long-term before the software calcifies. Early on you can change things, more or less at will</p> [...]<br>
