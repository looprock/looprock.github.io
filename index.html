            <b>Published:</b> 2023-10-31 06:43:38-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Just over seven years after it was introduced, the Touch Bar has now been fully discontinued on all new MacBooks sold by Apple, marking the end of an era for a hardware feature that was loved by some users and derided by others.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The first MacBook Pro models with the Touch Bar were released in October 2016, as part of a controversial redesign that also included a defective butterfly keyboard and the removal of many ports, including an SD card slot, HDMI, and MagSafe. Physical function and Esc keys were also removed in favor of the Touch Bar.

Apple initially <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2016/10/apple-unveils-groundbreaking-new-macbook-pro/">described</a> the Touch Bar as a "revolutionary" and "breakthrough" interface, but it was clearly not popular enough to stick around.
