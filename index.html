When you ask ‌Siri‌ to send a message in iOS 17, you can now tap to select which app on your iPhone that you want to send it from. This allows you to send messages not just from Apple's built-in Messages app, but also third-party apps like Telegram and WhatsApp.
<br/>
<br/>
The feature is compatible with any third-party app whose settings include the "Use with Ask ‌Siri‌" option. To check if an app has the option, or to enable/disable it, follow these steps.

<p>Entrepreneurship is a lot like building a house. You start with a solid foundation, lay bricks upon bricks, and put in long hours to create something of value that will last for generations to come.</p>
<p>\
You make sacrifices, take risks, and put in the long hours and hard work to build your wealth and provide for your family. It starts off slow, but over time, you get to see all that you have built.</p>
<p>\
But, just like a house, your wealth can come crashing down if you don’t build it with longevity in mind. That’s why you need to make sure your family’s legacy stays strong for generations to come through the process of wealth transfer.</p>
<p>\
Wealth transfer is like a delicate puzzle that requires skill, patience, and creativity to solve. It involves passing on your assets, both financial and non-financial, to your family in a way that protects your legacy and minimizes taxes.</p>

            It may be well that I should put a short preface to this book. In the summer of 1878 my father told me that he had written a memoir of his own life. He did not speak about it at length, but said that he had written me a letter, not to be opened until after his death, containing instructions for publication.

This letter was dated 30th April, 1876. I will give here as much of it as concerns the public: "I wish you to accept as a gift from me, given you now, the accompanying pages which contain a memoir of my life. My intention is that they shall be published after my death, and be edited by you. But I leave it altogether to your discretion whether to publish or to suppress the work;—and also to your discretion whether any part or what part shall be omitted. But I would not wish that anything should be added to the memoir. If you wish to say any word as from yourself, let it be done in the shape of a preface or introductory chapter."

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The UK government has denied that it has dropped a controversial plan to scan encrypted messaging services for harmful content as part of its Online Safety Bill, which is due to become law later this year.

A provision in the bill allows regulator Ofcom to order messaging services to use "accredited technology" to look for and take down child sexual abuse material.

However, according to a <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/770e58b1-a299-4b7b-a129-bded8649a43b">Financial Times</a></em> report, the British government's minister for arts and heritage, Stephen Parkinson, said on Wednesday that Ofcom would only be able to intervene if scanning content was "technically feasible" and if the process met minimum standards of privacy and accuracy.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 17, expected to be released in September, if you change your iPhone's passcode and forget it soon after, Apple now offers you a 72-hour grace period to fix it without getting locked out of your device. Here's how it works.

<br/>
In iOS 17 and iPadOS 17, it is now possible to reset an iPhone or iPad's new passcode with the previous passcode you used for up to three days after the change is made. In other words, Apple lets you use your old passcode within 72 hours of setting a new one, which is handy if you're someone who is likely to forget a newly created passcode.
<br/>
