<br/>
As always, the Pro Max model will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/29/iphone-17-display-sizes/">larger than the Pro model</a>:<ul><li>iPhone 17 Pro: 6.3-inch display</li>
<br/>
<li>iPhone 17 Pro Max: 6.9-inch display</li></ul>Given the Pro Max is physically larger than the Pro, it has more internal space, allowing for a larger battery and longer battery life. Nothing new.
<br/>
<br/>
It has been rumored that the Pro Max model will go one step further this year, though.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Today is Independence Day in the United States, and many Americans will be gathering to celebrate the Fourth of July holiday with friends and family. If you are headed to a backyard BBQ, we have a fun iPhone party trick to share with you.

<br/>
If you have a compatible iPhone model with a LiDAR Scanner (see the list below), you can measure a person's height in Apple's built-in Measure app. This way, you can see how much your nieces and nephews have grown since you last saw them, or find out if your favorite uncle is as tall as he claims he is. This might sound silly (it totally is!), but many people have no idea that iPhones offer this neat little feature.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Steps</h2><ol><li>Open the Measure app.</li>
<br/>
<li>Make sure the person is visible on your iPhone's screen from head to toe.</li>
