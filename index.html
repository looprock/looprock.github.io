            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple's annual developer and software-oriented event, is less than three weeks away. We haven't heard a great deal about macOS 16 ahead of its announcement this year, so we could be in for some major surprises when June 9 rolls around. Here's what we know so far about the next major update to Apple's Mac operating system.

<br/>
<h2>macOS 16 Name?</h2>
<br/>
Every year heading into WWDC, one question on many Mac fans' minds is what Apple will choose as the name for the next version of macOS. The tradition dates all the way back to the beginning of Mac OS X with its big cat names, and then in 2013 Apple shifted to Calfornia-themed names with the unveiling of OS X Mavericks.

Back in the early days after the debut of OS X Mavericks, we discovered a &lt;a href=" [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-05-20 07:00:33-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple last week added iPad Air models with the M2 chip to its <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished/ipad/ipad-air">refurbished store in the UK</a>, for the first time since the device was released in May 2024.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
As usual, the refurbished models are discounted by approximately 15% to 20% compared to Apple's original pricing for the equivalent brand-new models. For example, the 13-inch iPad Air with the M2 chip, 128GB of storage, and Wi-Fi only is <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/FV273ZN/A/Refurbished-13-inch-iPad-Air-M2-Wi-Fi-128GB-Space-Gray">currently available for £639</a>, compared to £799 when it was first released last year.
<br/>
<br/>
For now, availability is limited to the UK, but inventory should expand to the U.S. and other countries over the next several weeks.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If your iPhone regularly runs out of battery later in the day, Low Power Mode is one way to make it last longer. You can also make Low Power Mode automatically turn on when your battery reaches a certain custom level. Keep reading to learn how.

<br/>
Most iPhone users are familiar with the way iOS throws up a prompt to turn on Low Power Mode when the battery reaches 20%. Low Power Mode can also be turned on manually at any time by going to <strong>Settings -&gt; Battery</strong> and toggling on the switch next to <strong>Low Power Mode</strong>.
<br/>

If you find yourself constantly having to turn on Low Power Mode late in the day, you can save some time by setting it up to run automatically when your battery is depleted to a specific custom level. This can be done in the Shortcuts app, as the following steps show. [...]<br>

Smartphone exports from China to the US plummeted 72% to just under $700 million last month, outpacing the overall 21% decline in Chinese shipments to the United States. The sharp decline highlights how the Trump administration's aggressive tariffs campaign – which peaked with 145% levies on Chinese goods – is disrupting tech supply chains and diverting electronics production elsewhere.
