            <b>Published:</b> 2023-09-25 12:50:41-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> series is expected to gain an additional capacitive button, known internally as the "Capture Button." Codenamed "Project Nova," the button is likely to be one of the main selling points of the ‌iPhone 16‌ lineup, assuming it gets past the initial testing phase. The Capture Button is located on the same side as the Power button, only positioned slightly lower - where the mmWave cutout can be found on more recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models. The mmWave cutout has been moved to the opposite side, located under the volume buttons. It is currently unknown what the new capacitive button will be used for.

            Apple's new FineWoven cases for iPhone 15 models have been heavily criticized since they were released earlier this month, with some customers and media outlets complaining about the fabric exterior being prone to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23882255/apple-iphone-15-finewoven-case-wallet-bad">scratches</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.macstories.net/@viticci/111119387802099507">stains</a>.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-09-25 12:47:02+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Quantization is the process of converting values from a continuous range to a smaller set of discrete values, often used in deep neural networks to enhance inference speed on various devices. This conversion involves mapping high-precision formats like float32 to lower-precision formats like int8. Quantization can be uniform (linear mapping) or non-uniform (non-linear mapping). In symmetric quantization, zero in the input maps to zero in the output, while asymmetric quantization shifts this mapping. The scale factor and zero point are crucial parameters for quantization, determined through calibration. Quantization modes include Post Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization Aware Training (QAT), with QAT offering better model accuracy through fine-tuning. It involves using fake quantizers to make quantization compatible with the differentiability required for fine-tuning.<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-09-25 12:24:03+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Despite the rise of no-code platforms, DevOps is far from dead. DevOps continues to evolve, emphasizing engagement, enablement, and collaboration between development and operations teams. While NoOps presents an intriguing vision of automation, DevOps remains essential due to its adaptability, necessity for complex environments, and compliance requirements. DevOps ensures stable software delivery, secure productions, fast releases, and efficient automations. It also integrates seamlessly with cloud and AI systems, making it a vital asset in the modern IT landscape. No-code platforms offer ease of use but lack the versatility and tailored outputs of DevOps, ensuring its continued relevance and expansion in the future.<br>

          PILGRIMS’ CLUB OF NEW YORK ON FEBRUARY 19, 1908

I am very proud to respond to this toast, as it recalls the proudest day of my life. The delightful hospitality shown me at the time of my visit to Oxford I shall cherish until I die. In that long and distinguished career of mine I value that degree above all other honors. When the ship landed even the stevedores gathered on the shore and gave an English cheer. Nothing could surpass in my life the pleasure of those four weeks. No one could pass by me without taking my hand, even the policemen. I’ve been in all the principal capitals of Christendom in my life, and have always been an object of interest to policemen. Sometimes there was suspicion in their eyes, but not always. With their puissant hand they would hold up the commerce of the world to let me pass.

I noticed in the papers this afternoon a despatch from Washington, saying that Congress would immediately pass a bill restoring to [...]<br>

In an article discussing stagnating global tablet demand in the second half of 2023, the Taiwan-based outlet forecasts an uptick in Apple's share of the market owing to orders for a "small-size" iPad in the fourth quarter. From the report (see bold): <blockquote>In the second quarter, iPad shipments had a sequential decline higher than those of non-iPad tablets, resulting in iPads' combined shipment share seeing two consecutive quarters of decline. However, the share will gradually pick up during the second half because of Apple's inventory replenishment needs in the third quarter and <strong>or</strong></blockquote> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The “Dolphin” had a good crew, not fighting men, or boarding sailors, but good working men, and that was all she wanted. These brave, determined fellows were all, more or less, merchants; they sought a fortune rather than glory; they had no flag to display, no colours to defend with cannon; in fact all the artillery on board consisted of two small swivel signal-guns.

The “Dolphin” shot bravely across the water, and fulfilled the utmost expectations of both builder and captain. Soon she passed the limit of British seas; there was not a ship in sight; the great Ocean route was free; besides no ship of the Federal marine would have a right to attack her beneath the English flag. Followed she might be, and prevented from forcing the blockade, and precisely for this reason had James Playfair sacrificed everything to the speed of his ship, in order not to be pursued.<br>

            iFixit today <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYLLtDxT_sM">shared a video</a> with teardowns of the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Apple Watch Series 9, providing a closer look inside the watches.

<br/>
Notably, the video confirms that the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is equipped with a 564 mAh battery, as <em>MacRumors</em> was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-battery-capacities/">first to report last week</a> via a regulatory database. This is around a 4% larger capacity than the 542 mAh battery in the original Apple Watch Ultra, but Apple says both models have the same battery life of up to 36 hours.
<br/>
<br/>
The video also confirms that the 41mm Series 9's battery capacity is 282 mAh, which is unchanged from the 41mm Series 8.
