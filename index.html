            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">upcoming iPhone 16 models</a> that we're expecting to see in September are going to be quite similar to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models, but rumors suggest that Apple is making big changes in 2025. We've been hearing hints of an all-new device in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> lineup, and it may be the most expensive ‌iPhone‌ Apple has offered to date.

Rumors have taken to referring to the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> that Apple has planned as the "‌iPhone 17‌ Slim," but Apple almost certainly won't use that naming. The "slim" descriptor references the sleeker, thinner design of  [...]<br>

            Google no longer plans to deprecate third-party cookies in the Chrome browser, marking a notable change to a prior decision to phase out third-party cookies by 2025. Google announced its cookie updates <a href="https://privacysandbox.com/intl/en_us/news/privacy-sandbox-update/">in a blog post</a> shared today, where the company said that it instead plans to focus on user choice.

Rather than eliminating third-party cookies entirely, Google will introduce "a new experience in Chrome" that is designed to allow people to "make an informed choice" applicable across their web browsing.

            Students have rights. That&#8217;s something educators and (especially) administrators seem to forget.

<br/>
The failure was caused by an update to the CrowdStrike Falcon antivirus software that auto-installed on Windows 10 PCs, but Mac and Linux machines were not affected even though they received the same software. A report from <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/cybersecurity/microsoft-tech-outage-role-crowdstrike-50917b90">The Wall Street Journal</a></em> delves into what happened and includes some critical information from Microsoft on why Macs did not get taken out by the update.

We also got a surprise hardware update this week, but it was one of the most minor updates imaginable – swapping out the Space Gray color of the HomePod mini for a new version in an extremely similar Midnight color.
