            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Delta recently added support for iOS 26's upgraded boarding pass experience in the Apple Wallet app, according <a href="https://x.com/binner_aar99282/status/1985797942842732602">to <em>MacRumors</em> reader Aaron Binner</a>.

<br/>
This appears to be a server-side change across all iOS 26 versions.
<br/>
<br/>
The upgraded boarding passes have an option to turn on Live Activities, allowing you to keep track of your flight at a glance on your iPhone's Lock Screen, and in the Dynamic Island. You can also share the Live Activities widget with others.
<br/>
<br/>
In addition, new shortcuts provide one-tap access to Apple Maps for airport directions, and to the Find My app for baggage tracking.

All English podcast shows will now get automatically created chapters, which makes it easier to navigate through them. Apple says that automatic chapters will also make it simpler for users to understand an episode's structure and return to specific sections that interest them.
<br/>

Apple will use podcast chapters submitted by creators if they're available, but if not, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a> will generate them by default. Podcast creators can turn off the setting in ‌Apple Podcasts‌ Connect.

<p>Suppose that 95% of enterprise AI transformations fail. How does that compare to the failure rate of normal enterprise IT projects?</p>
<p>This might seem like a silly question for those unfamiliar with enterprise AI projects - whatever the failure rate, <em>surely</em> it can’t be close to 95%! Well. In 2016, Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucerogers/2016/01/07/why-84-of-companies-fail-at-digital-transformation/">interviewed</a> the author of another study very much like the NANDA report, except about IT transformations in general, and found an 84% failure rate. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/McKinsey%20Digital/Our%20Insights/Delivering%20large%20scale%20IT%20projects%20on%20time%20on%20budget%20and%20on%20value/Delivering%20large%20scale%20IT%20projects%20on%20time%20on%20budget%20and%20on%20value.pdf">McKinsey</a> has only one in 200 IT projects coming in on time and within budget.
