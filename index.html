            Apple today stopped signing iOS 17.3.1 preventing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users from downgrading to that version of iOS. iOS 17.3.1 is no longer being signed following the March 5 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-features/">release of iOS 17.4</a>, an update that introduced app ecosystem changes in the EU, new emoji, and more.

<br/>
Apple routinely stops signing older versions of iOS, so it is not unusual that the iOS 17.3.1 update is no longer available. Apple prevents users from installing older versions of iOS to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date and to prevent downgrading to older, less secure versions of the ‌iPhone‌ operating system.

A large number of references to the app were discovered in the latest version of TikTok, revealing some of its functionality, integrations, and even its app icon.

Elsewhere in Europe, ‌Apple Maps‌ currently provides cycling routes across France and Germany, as well as in Barcelona, Spain, and London, England. Coverage is more widespread in other parts of the world, such as mainland China, Japan, the United States, and select cities in Canada.
