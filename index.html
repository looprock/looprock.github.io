            The PlayStation Vita was a console that was praised by critics, had a few solid first-party games such as Uncharted: Golden Abyss and still to this day has a dedicated fanbase. The handheld device, however, was doomed from the start with the high price tag for the console itself and memory cards, high competition with the Nintendo 3DS, and the rise in popularity of mobile gaming. It looks like Sony is going to make another mistake with their next handheld console, Project Q.<br>

            iPhone users in Australia can now receive next-hour precipitation forecasts and notifications from the Weather app, according to an updated <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211777">Apple support document</a>.

"Next-hour precipitation forecasts and precipitation notifications are available for Australia, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States," the document says. "The information is provided by Apple using data from national weather services."
<br/>
<br/>
Apple says next-hour precipitation forecasts are "hyperlocal" and "down to the minute." The Weather app can send iPhone users a push notification if it is going to rain in the next hour, and shows how much rainfall is expected by the minute. The feature has been available in the U.S. since the release of iOS 14 in 2020.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Popular third-party Reddit app Apollo is set to shut down after today as Reddit will be implementing its paid API changes tomorrow. Apollo's shuttering was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/08/apollo-shutting-down-june-30/">announced earlier in June</a> after developer Christian Selig was unable to work out a deal with Reddit to keep the app functional.

<br/>
Reddit as of tomorrow will be charging third-party developers who use its API. Every 1,000 API calls will be priced at $0.24, with 50 million available for $12,000. With the number of users that Apollo has and the average API calls used per person, Selig calculated that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/31/reddit-api-changes-pricing-apollo/">he would need to pay</a> $1.7 million per month or $20 million per year to keep Apollo function [...]<br>

<br/>
Starting a video in Twitter and then swiping out of the app leaves the video player open, so Twitter users can use other apps while continuing to watch video content from the social network. 
<br/>
<br/>
Twitter has had an in-app picture-in-picture option previously, but the new feature allows Twitter video to be watched while using other apps, similar to how YouTube and other video content apps work on iPhones and iPads.
