            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-05 04:36:56-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WhatsApp is testing a new feature that allows people to communicate with users over the platform even if they don't have an account.

<br/>
According to <em><a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-25-22-13-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a></em>, the latest WhatsApp beta for Android contains references to so-called "guest chats," which lets users send a link to an online chat, where the "guest" doesn't have to have an app on their device or even need to be in possession of a WhatsApp account.
<br/>
<br/>
To kick off a guest chat, the WhatsApp user has to invite someone from their contacts who doesn't have the app installed and share a chat link. When the recipient opens the link, they're granted access to an online end-to-end encrypted chat with the sender – likely via an interface similar to WhatsApp Web.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is still on track to release a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> model later this year, according to a reliable source speaking to <em>MacRumors</em>.

<br/>
According to a source familiar with the company's plans, Apple is highly likely to replace the current ‌Apple TV‌ 4K with a new model later this year. The current model will be discontinued. 
<br/>
<br/>
Today's ‌Apple TV‌ 4K came out in 2022, featuring the A15 Bionic chip, support for HDR10+, and a tweaked <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> Remote with a USB-C port for charging. Apple does not refresh the ‌Apple TV‌'s hardware frequently, releasing a new model around every three years. This 2022 model is the newest and only ‌Apple TV‌ in the company's product lineup.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iPhone 17 event this year appears to be scheduled for Tuesday, September 9, according to internal information from German mobile phone providers, as reported by <em><a href="https://www.iphone-ticker.de/iphone-17-vorstellung-wohl-am-9-verkaufsstart-am-19-september-261445/">iphone-ticker.de</a></em>.

<br/>
The timing lines up with a recent prediction by <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, who suggested Apple would hold its iPhone 17 announcement during the week of September 8. Gurman identified September 9 or 10 as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/14/iphone-17-to-be-announced-week-of-september-8/">most probable dates</a>, making the German carriers' claim all the more likely.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Despite being over two years old, Apple's AirPods Pro 2 still dominate the premium wireless‑earbud space, thanks to a potent mix of top‑tier audio, class‑leading noise cancellation, and Apple's habit of delivering major new features through software updates. Rumors suggest AirPods Pro 3 could arrive as soon as September 2025 alongside the iPhone 17 lineup, giving prospective AirPods buyers a dilemma: snap up the proven AirPods Pro 2 at today's prices, or hold off for the next‑generation model that could raise the bar once again?

Apart from their sonic strengths, the enduring popularity of AirPods Pro 2 owes much to Apple's ongoing feature rollouts. iOS 17 (2023) introduced Adaptive Audio, mute controls, and faster device switching. iOS 18 (2024) followed up with &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-airpods-p [...]<br>

            The most notable change to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> is the Liquid Glass design overhaul, which is the first major iOS design update since Apple rolled out iOS 7 back in 2013. There are new features in ‌iOS 26‌, of course, but added functionality has definitely been sidelined in favor of the design refresh.

<br/>
We've compiled a walkthrough of Liquid Glass, so you know what to expect when you install ‌iOS 26‌. A lot of what's here is also applicable to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a> and macOS Tahoe too.

<br/>
Keep in mind that Apple is still refining Liquid Glass and some of the design could see further changes, but we'll update this guide with each revision.

Starting today, ChatGPT will provide users with "gentle reminders" about how long they've been using the service, with suggestions for breaks. OpenAI says that it isn't measuring success by time spent on ChatGPT, but by ensuring that people leave the product after finishing what they came for.

Spotify is sending out emails to customers who will see their subscription prices go up.

A sample email suggests that prices in an unnamed European country are increasing by a euro, from €10.99 to €11.99. Price hikes will vary by location, and Spotify users can see the new pricing for their country by <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/">visiting the Spotify website</a>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 26, currently in beta, gives you two distinct ways to add websites to your iPhone's Home screen – as web apps or traditional bookmarks. They might look similar at first glance, but choosing the right option can dramatically improve how you access your favorite sites.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>Understanding the Difference</h2>
<br/>
When you add a website to your Home screen via Safari's "Add to Home Screen" option, iOS 26 automatically detects whether the site supports progressive web app (PWA) functionality. Web apps run almost like native apps, with features like offline access, push notifications, and a streamlined interface without Safari's address bar. In contrast, traditional bookmarks simply open the website in Safari when tapped.

This choice matters more than you might think. Web apps can provide a faster, [...]<br>

            Missing the familiar Safari design from iOS 18? In iOS 26, currently in beta, Apple has learned from past criticism and made it easy to ditch the new Compact layout in favor of the classic tab layouts you may well prefer.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
