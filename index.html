            Late last year, former Apple designer Imran Chaudhri and former Apple software manager Bethany Bongiorno launched one of the first AI wearables under their Humane brand.

            Disney plans start seriously cracking down on password sharing for the Disney+ streaming service in September, Disney CEO Bob Iger said in during today's earnings call (via <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215224/disney-password-sharing-crackdown-september">The Verge</a></em>).

<br/>
Iger said that Disney would begin eliminating password sharing "in earnest" next month. Disney has actually been talking about getting rid of password sharing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/disney-password-sharing-crackdown/">since last September</a>, but the timeline has shifted a few times. Disney started rolling out a ban on password sharing in some countries in June, but it sounds like the company's efforts will expand to the U.S. and other countries in September 2024.

Huffman said that Reddit plans to "unlock the door" for subreddits that could have "exclusive content or private areas."<blockquote>I think the existing, altruistic, free version of Reddit will continue to exist and grow and thrive just the way it has.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18, currently in beta, Apple has broadened the customization options for the Home Screen on iPhone, and thanks to a new setting it is now possible to make app icons and widgets bigger by hiding their labels. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960988" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/big-icons-home-screen.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
With the setting enabled in iOS 18, the names of apps are removed from the grid, which increases the size of the icons and widgets on your Home Screen with the space saved. With larger icons, you still get a maximum of six icon rows with four icons each, the same that you're limited to when icon names are turned on.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're familiar enough with your favorite apps that you don't feel the need to see the names underneath the icons, then it's worth giving it a try. With the labels removed, the design of your app icons takes center stage, resulting in a cleaner look for your Home Screen. Note that [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18, Apple has added a control in the Camera app's Settings menu that lets you choose whether audio playing on your iPhone should pause or continue when you start recording in Video mode.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960959" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/allow-audio-playback-camera-setting.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
In previous versions of iOS, shooting in Video mode in the Camera app automatically pauses any playing audio including music and podcasts. This behavior is based on the assumption that you don't want any sound coming out of your iPhone's speakers to be picked up on the video recording, but it's no good if you want to play a soundtrack to accompany whatever you're shooting.

One way to get around this is to use the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-quicktake-iphone-11/">QuickTake method of recording video</a> in Photo mode, introduced in iOS 13, which allows any audio playback to continue duri [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>

<br/>
Flighty is using aviation authority data and machine learning to provide early warnings of delays, and when a delay is official, the reason for the delay. Most delays are due to airspace issues and late aircraft, both of which Flighty will monitor.
<br/>
<br/>
The app is able to predict delays "hours in advance," and give information to Flighty users that airlines often decline to share. The result is more control over travel plans.<blockquote>For example, the airline might delay your flight by 30 minutes ... and then another hour. But with these updates, Flighty 4 can tell you that's likely to be at least a five-hour d</blockquote> [...]<br>

It runs as a &ldquo;middle-box&rdquo;, monitoring traffic that passes through it. It recently gained the ability to track individual data flows - connections between two endpoints. It&rsquo;s also my favorite Open Source project, to which I contribute regularly.
