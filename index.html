            Apple today shared a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07cKD8GK__c">iPhone 15 Plus ad</a> on its YouTube channel that highlights the device's long-lasting battery life.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
In the video, an electrical outlet becomes sentient and sings the song "Way Too Long" by rapper Doe Boy. The outlet is sad that the iPhone 15 Plus lasts so long between charges, resulting in the device being plugged in less often.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple's tech specs say the iPhone 15 Plus can provide up to 26 hours of offline video playback, and up to 100 hours of audio playback. Like the iPhone 14 Plus, the iPhone 15 Plus offers the longest advertised battery life of any iPhone ever.

Apple's video description:<blockquote>Big screen. Big battery life. iPhone 15 Plus is here. Dynamic Island. New 48MP Main camera. 2x Telephoto. Next-generation portraits. Water resistant (IP68).

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>We throw around the term “waste” a lot in software. It’s been around since the 2000s, at least since the Poppendieck’s book <em>Lean Software Development</em>. DevOps really took it and ran with it, it was renamed “toil” in SRE, and now the concept is pretty solidly part of how we think of software. I<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaHnNw_aWQk"> talked with Steve Pereira on what “waste” means</a> exactly. We talked about value stream maps as well, another concept that’s so common that we don’t define it much anymore. He also brought the concept of slack, which I haven’t thought of in a long time. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaHnNw_aWQk">Check out the discussion</a>!</p><div class="youtube-wrap" id="youtube2-SaHnNw_aWQk"><div class="youtube-inner"></div></div><h1>Logoff</h1><p>There’s not much going on since it’s holiday times.</p><br>
