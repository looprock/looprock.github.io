            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/15/apple-seeds-ios-26-3-beta-1/">With iOS 26.3</a>, Apple is making it simpler for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users to transition to an Android smartphone, with new built-in tools for transferring data.

<br/>
The new transfer tool allows an ‌iPhone‌ user to place their device next to an Android device to initiate a transfer process. With the two smartphones connected, users can opt to move over photos, messages, notes, apps, passwords, phone number, and more. Data transfers occur with no need to download and use a separate app, making the process simpler.
<br/>
<br/>
Health data, devices paired with Bluetooth, and protected items like locked notes are not transferred over to the new device.

The garbage collector quietly does its job, and unlike C or C++, we rarely think about malloc or free. This doesn’t mean that there are no memory leaks in Python. Reference cycles, unreleased resources like connection pooling, global caches, etc can slowly inflate your process’s memory footprint. You might not notice it at first, until your worker starts OOM-ing, latency creeps up, or container restarts become mysteriously frequent.</p><p>In this post, we’ll share the story of a real-world memory leak we encountered during a Python upgrade — how we discovered it, the tools and techniques we used to investigate, and the lessons we learned.</p><h3>What happened after upgrading to Python 3.10?</h3> [...]<br>

Developers can download the macOS Tahoe 26.3 update by opening up the System Settings app, selecting the General category, and then choosing Software Update. Beta Updates will need to be enabled, and a free developer account is required.

            Apple today provided developers with the first betas of upcoming watchOS 26.3, tvOS 26.3, and visionOS 26.3 betas for testing purposes. The software comes a few days after Apple launched the 26.2 versions of each platform.

The software updates are available through the Settings app on each device, and because these are developer betas, a free developer account is required.

We don't know what new features might be added in watchOS 26.3, visionOS 26.3, and tvOS 26.3. Apple doesn't typically provide release notes for betas, so we might not know what's new until the software updates see a public launch unless there are outward-facing changes.

            We’ve talked about the Australian social media ban that went into effect last week, how dumb it is, and why it’s already a mess. But late last week, some additional news broke that makes the whole thing even more grotesque: turns out the campaign pushing hardest for the ban was run by an ad agency [&#8230;]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/125851">support document</a> published on Friday, Apple said that a "technical failure" in Australia prevented some older mobile phones from being able to make emergency calls by dialing 000, and it said there is a low chance that it could happen again.

"In the rare event that these exceptional circumstances affecting mobile operators' networks were to happen again, some older mobile phones may still encounter the same issue reaching emergency services through an alternate available network," said Apple.

<br/>
According to a new post, via machine translation, Apple is developing what the leaker describes as a "wide foldable" device, a term used to refer to a horizontally oriented, book-style foldable with a large internal display. The device is said to prioritize thinness, with several major design decisions reportedly made to reduce the overall thickness of the chassis.

Chief among these is the use of a side-mounted <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> fingerprint sensor. The leaker claims Apple has c [...]<br>

According to the report, Home Office officials want device operating systems to prevent any nudity from being displayed unless users can verify that they're adults through biometric checks or official ID.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Enterprises have a habit of &ldquo;professionalizing&rdquo; consumer tech by adding control - security, compliance, cost management, approved architectures. All reasonable. And often exactly what kills the thing.</p>
<p>Heroku and early cloud worked because they <em>removed</em> friction: no tickets, no permission, no approved stack. Developers could move fast, make local tradeoffs, and live with the consequences.</p>
<p>Enterprise adoption usually means re-introducing the friction the tech was designed to eliminate. It&rsquo;s called maturity. It feels like regression.</p>
<p>When you make the goose enterprise-grade, you often kill the goose.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Eventually, software is very hard to change. There are numerous reasons for this, and they often don’t even involve the software. The systems that run the software are old, regulators don’t let you change things, security controls, people have just forgotten how to program COBOL. There is so much code that it’s hard to know what the code does.</p>
<p>So when you want to change it, you don’t know what to do. The ultimate sign of legacy software is that you don’t know how to test it after making changes. If you can’t test software, you can’t safely make changes, the Michael Feathers definition of legacy code.</p>
<p>I could get distracted by discussing the reasons, but we all know that <a href="https://cote.io/legacytrap/">software just becomes “legacy” at some point</a>.</p>
<p>This means that you have to figure out building software that will be valuable in the long-term before the software calcifies. Early on you can change things, more or less at will</p> [...]<br>

<blockquote>
<p>For generative AI (GenAI) apps to deliver real business value, they need access to your company’s proprietary data. Without it, models default to the public data they were trained on–meaning you get the same generic ideas as your competitors. If everyone is starting with the same new ideas, competitive advantage disappears. This is exactly like hiring an outside consultant and refusing to show them how your business actually operates.</p>
<p>APIs are the predominant way to give GenAI apps access to this crucial data. This is leading to a massive proliferation of custom endpoints that are skipping rigorous security checks, governance, and cost analysis. This phenomenon is not new. In fact, it’s the classic enterprise adoption pattern whereby teams prioritize features and speed over safety and oversight. This A</p></blockquote> [...]<br>
