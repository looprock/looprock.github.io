<p>We are simplifying our IT, reducing the number of applications and increasing the use of APIs and standardized tools. Thanks to our IT investments since 2023, we have successfully de-commissioned over 700 applications with a target of 1,000 in 2028…AI is a key driver of efficiency.</p>

<p>Neil Ward-Dutton, an IDC analyst focused on AI, automation, data and analytics, said three announcements on the first day of the conference were of note. “AWS AI Factories is one,” he said. “These are AWS AI infrastructure and software stacks, built and managed by AWS, but deployed in customers’ own datacentres. “These are, at least initially, aimed at the largest customers with the most challenging security or sovereignty requirements.”</p>
<p>The second, he said, was Amazon Nova Forge. “This is the ability for customers to bring their own training data corpuses to part-trained Nova models, completing model training to create domain-specialised models that can be deployed to Bedrock,” said Ward-Dutton.</p>
<p>The third is the “policy specification and evaluations in Bedrock AgentCore”, which is a group of agent-based AI tools and products announced by AWS in July 2025.
