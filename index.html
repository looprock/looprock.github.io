            Starting with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/apple-seeds-ios-17-1-public-beta-1/">first iOS 17.1 beta</a> released last week, Reachability <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/16u283t/ios_171_db1_reachability_now_uses_a_pure_black/">now has a solid black background</a> on all iPhone models with the Dynamic Island, instead of a blurred view of the device's wallpaper. This minor change means the Dynamic Island no longer appears twice on the screen when Reachability is being used.

            <p>High-quality data is necessary for the success of every data-driven company. It enables everything from reliable business logic to insightful decision-making and robust machine learning modeling. It is now the norm for tech companies to have a well-developed data platform. This makes it easy for engineers to generate, transform, store, and analyze data at the petabyte scale. As such, we have reached a point where the quantity of data is no longer a boundary. Yet this has come at the cost of quality.</p><p>In this post we will define data quality at a high-level and explore our motivation to achieve better data quality. We will then introduce our in-house product, Verity, and showcase how it serves as a central platform for ensuring data quality in our <a href="https://hive.apache.org/">Hive Data Warehouse</a>.

<br/>
The <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3453">Digital Markets, Competition, and Consumers Bill</a> (DMCC) that the UK is developing would allow competition authorities to impose conduct requirements on companies and "promote competition" when a company's policies are "having an adverse effect on competition."

<br/>
As of October 1, customers who send a direct message to the <a href="https://twitter.com/applesupport">@AppleSupport account on X</a> receive an automated reply with links to the Get Support page on Apple's website, and to the Apple Support app for the iPhone and iPad. The account also appears to have stopped offering human replies to posts tagging the @AppleSupport account, but it still provides some automated replies with links to various pages on Apple's website.

<br/>
The account's description previously said it was "available every day to answer your questions," but that text was removed this week.
