            <b>Published:</b> 2024-10-16 15:27:32-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Amazon <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-kindle-color-scribe-paperwhite-entry">today refreshed</a> its popular Kindle e-reader lineup, introducing the first Kindle that has a color display. The $280 Kindle Colorsoft has a 7-inch high-contrast display that Amazon says offers "paper-like color."
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
While Amazon has released tablets with traditional LCD displays that support color, the Colorsoft is E Ink like Amazon's other Kindle tablets, but with new technology that allows for color. Amazon is using LED pixels and a new oxide backplane for color without impacting resolution or increasing latency when turning pages.
<br/>
<br/>
There have been rumors that Apple has tested electronic paper display (EPD) technology for future devices, including color EPD, which is similar to what Amazon has just rolled out. [...]<br>

            Given recent events, it now seems unlikely that Apple will update its entry-level iPad this year.

<br/>
First and foremost, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/16/apple-reduces-pad-price-europe-no-charger/">lowered the price of the iPad 10</a> and stopped including a charger with the device in Europe this week, and there is a low chance that Apple would have proceeded with those changes if an iPad 11 was imminent.
<br/>
<br/>
Second, Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/apple-unveils-new-ipad-mini-apple-intelligence/">announcement of a new iPad mini</a> in a standalone press release this week further suggests that the iPad 11 is not coming soon.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's chief people officer Carol Surface is leaving the company, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-16/apple-s-chief-people-officer-to-exit-after-less-than-two-years">Bloomberg</a></em>.

<br/>
Most senior executives are at Apple for much longer periods of time, and it is not clear why Surface is leaving. She was hired when Apple decided to split its primary human resources role from retail last year, and she reported directly to Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>.

Deirdre O'Brien had been handling both the retail and people (or HR) role, but when Surface took over, O'Brien transitioned to just overseeing retail. With Surface leaving, O'Brien will once agai [...]<br>

"Apple is expected to unveil new MacBook Pro models equipped with the latest M4 chip in October, which could boost related component shipments," says the paywalled report, published today. "This trend is evident in the revenue reports from component manufacturers such as Jarllytec and Shin Zu Shing for September."

A few of the early believers called them “audio blogs,” and the journalist often credited with coining the term “podcast” also offered “GuerillaMedia” as an alternative in the very same article. (And actually, there’s plenty of debate over exactly who coined the term and when. The history of the podcast is more contentious than you’d think.)</p>

<p id="VLhmFa">Flipping through your high school scrapbook is a humbling experience. There’s a lot to reckon with — including braces and bootcut jeans, in my case — and you get a sense of what kinds of moments you thought were worth preserving. Apparently, a great deal of funny things happened to my friends and me as we loafed around a suburban coffee shop avoiding homework. Looking through those pages, I can find plenty of documentation of life as we waited for our teammates to finish their tennis matches and turned the communal couch at Caribou Coffee into our own private rec room.
