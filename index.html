            Chinese smartphone company OnePlus this week introduced its first foldable smartphone, the OnePlus Open. OnePlus joins several other manufacturers that have come out with foldable smartphones, including Samsung, Google, and Xiaomi. We picked up the OnePlus Open to see how it compares to Apple's latest flagship, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max.

<br/>
The OnePlus Open is similar to the Galaxy Fold in that it opens up like a book. When folded, the cover screen has a 6.31-inch display that's about in the middle of the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ and Pro Max in terms of size. Unfolded, the display measures in at 7.82 inches, so a bit smaller than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is unlikely to release any new Macs or iPads for the remainder of 2023, according to a series of predictions shared in recent weeks by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-878408" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/apple-silicon-mac-lineup-wwdc-2022-feature-purple.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
<h2>Macs</h2>
<br/>
<br/>
Last month, Kuo said Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/">unlikely to release any new MacBooks with the M3 chip</a> this year. All existing MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models are equipped with M2 series chips, so any new models would presumably be equipped with M3 chips, which effectively means that Kuo does not expect any new MacBooks at all for the rest of 2023.
<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this week, Kuo added that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/24-inch-imac-2024-launch/">24-inch iMac would be updated next in 2024</a>, ruling out an up [...]<br>

            <p>Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) at the cluster level has been supported by the Oracle database for many years and has become a requirement of many security specifications and best practices. 
The Oracle <a class="txt2html" href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/12.2/asoag/introduction-to-transparent-data-encryption.html#GUID-769EC29B-0107-40FE-9A9D-BF81A4BBD0E9" style="text-decoration: none;">documentation</a> lists two
practical advantages of the feature:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Encrypted storage which protects data in case of storage media theft
  </li><li>Regulatory compliance
</li></ul>
<p>Interestingly, it does not mention increased protection from data being accessed by database users, database superusers, or operating system users, and that is because it has limited value in protecting

<br/>
Citing industry sources, <em>‌DigiTimes‌</em> highlighted that unlike the 12.9-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, the 12.9-inch ‌iPad Air‌ will not feature a mini-LED display. The device will instead feature the same LCD technology used in the current, 10.9-inch ‌iPad Air‌. The information was shared in <em>‌DigiTimes‌</em>' "Before Going to Press" section, so while information about the new device is currently limited, more will follow tomorrow.
