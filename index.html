            You may be tired of hearing about measles by now, but measles is not tired of infecting Americans. It&#8217;s worth reminding ourselves that this is a disease that was declared gone in America. Cases and transmission rates were so low in 2000, thanks almost entirely to the widespread promotion and adoption of the MMR vaccine, [&#8230;]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Back in 2012, an Apple retail employee named Sam Sung went viral because his name is similar to Samsung, one of Apple's main competitors. In a recent interview with <em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-sung-goes-viral-why-changed-name-after-apple-fame-2025-10">Business Insider</a></em>, he detailed that period in his life, how Apple responded, and he explained why he ultimately changed his name.

<br/>
Someone posted an image of Sung's Apple business card on Reddit in 2012, and it spread rapidly. Apple called him and asked him if he was aware of the post, and he became paranoid that he would lose his job.
<br/>
<br/>
"I was so scared, and I just wanted to keep my head down and stay employed," he said.

After a reporter approached him while he was at work, Apple pulled Sung from the store floor, and employee [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The NFC Forum announced <a href="https://nfc-forum.org/news/2025-10-nfc-forum-launches-certification-to-support-extended-range-of-contactless-connections/">NFC Certification Release 15 (CR15)</a>, introducing a change that boosts the potential read range of NFC devices. CR15 defines the certification program for compliance with the NFC Release 15 specification that was announced earlier this year.

<br/>
CR15 allows devices to certify for a read range of up to 20mm, which is a meaningful improvement over the prior 5mm limit. The NFC Forum says that the range increase will improve the user experience by requiring less precise alignment for a connection.

            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> demand failed to meet Apple's expectations and the company's supply chain is scaling back shipments and production, reports <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1981051589000671742">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.

<br/>
Suppliers are expected to reduce capacity by more than 80 percent between now and the first quarter of 2026, and some components with longer lead times will be discontinued by the end of 2025.
<br/>
<br/>
According to Kuo, the ‌iPhone Air‌'s poor performance suggests that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> and 17 Pro models already "cover the majority of high-end user demand," so there is little room for new market segments.

"Apple Vision Pro is not eligible for trade-in," says Apple, in the fine print of a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/new-ipad-pro-14-inch-macbook-pro-and-apple-vision-pro-now-available/">press release</a>.

Some customers who spent at least $3,499 on the original Vision Pro may be disappointed to learn that Apple is not willing to offer any credit for the device.

            Apple's "A20" chip designed for next year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models could be considerably more expensive, the <a href="https://www.chinatimes.com/newspapers/20250922000510-260110?chdtv"><em>China Times</em></a> reports.

<br/>
The A20 chip is likely to be the first widely available 2-nanometer chip, debuting in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> lineup next year and forming the foundation of subsequent M6-series chips. The previous three generation A-series chips have all been based on TMSC's 3-nanometer node, with the upgrade to 2-nanometer promising further performance and efficiency improvements.

TSMC has reportedly told customers, presumably including Apple, to expect pricing that is at least 50% higher than 3-nanometer processors. This [...]<br>
