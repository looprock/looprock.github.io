            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is going to launch a new version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> as soon as tomorrow, so we thought we'd go over what to expect from Apple's upcoming Mac.

<br/>
<h2>M5 Chip</h2>
<br/>
The ‌MacBook Pro‌ will be one of the first new devices to use the next-generation M5 chip, which will replace the M4 chip.
<br/>
<br/>
The M5 is built on TSMC's more advanced 3-nanometer process, and it will bring speed and efficiency improvements. A leaked <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> with an M5 chip was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/30/ipad-pro-with-m5-chip-unboxing-video-leak/">benchmarked two weeks ago</a>, and it featured 12 percent faster multi-core CPU performance compared to the M4 chip, and a 36 percent faster GPU.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With every flagship smartphone launch, the new devices are subject to bend tests, drop tests, and other durability tests. YouTuber JerryRigEverything (Zack Nelson) is known for his scratch and bend tests, and he did his usual routine with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. This time, something went wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
When Nelson bent the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, it broke on the first test, and the second test damaged the battery and engulfed his studio in smoke. Nelson bent the smartphone backward in a way unlikely to occur in normal use, but it's also the first time that he's had a battery rupture.
<br/>
<br/>
"Surprisingly, in the decade that I've been durability testing phones, I have never had a smartphone explode before," he says. "The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the first phone to go up in smoke."
<br/>
<br/>
He goes on to explain that he's subjected every mainstream smartphone from the last decade to the exact same tests, but this is the first time he's had a failure that set off [...]<br>

Our marketplace is home to more than 100 million special items made, handpicked and designed by more than 5 million sellers. These items and the real people behind them are what set us apart.
