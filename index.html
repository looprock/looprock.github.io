            The upcoming iPhone 16 Pro models will be able to record 4K video at up to 120 FPS, according to "reliable sources" cited in a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/06/iphone-16-pro-4k-120fps-video-camera/"><em>9to5Mac</em> report</a> today. For comparison, all four iPhone 15 models are capable of 4K video recording at up to 60 FPS.

The report adds that Apple has allegedly tested 8K video recording on the iPhone 16 Pro models, but it is unclear if this capability will be enabled. Since an 8K image is around 33 megapixels, the rumored 48-megapixel Main and Ultra Wide cameras on the iPhone 16 Pro models would be capable of 8K video recording, but the 12-megapixel Telephoto camera would not be.
