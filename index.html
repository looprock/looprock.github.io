            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            n the preceding chapter we saw that there are two sorts of knowledge: knowledge of things, and knowledge of truths. In this chapter we shall be concerned exclusively with knowledge of things, of which in turn we shall have to distinguish two kinds. Knowledge of things, when it is of the kind we call knowledge by acquaintance, is essentially simpler than any knowledge of truths, and logically independent of knowledge of truths, though it would be rash to assume that human beings ever, in fact, have acquaintance with things without at the same time knowing some truth about them. Knowledge of things by description, on the contrary, always involves, as we shall find in the course of the present chapter, some knowledge of truths as its source and ground. But first of all we must make clear what we mean by 'acquaintance' and what we mean by 'description'.<br>

            Blockchain technology is one fascinating piece of engineering marvel that has taken the 2020s by storm. By now, you may only associate the blockchain with cryptocurrency but interestingly, the application of blockchain technology spans above and beyond what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and alt-projects have achieved so far. Being a decentralized and distributed ledger technology that makes data altercation impossible, the blockchain is a revolutionary asset for customer data security in healthcare, transfer of wills, protection of copyrights and loyalties, the IoT, voting, and of course, cryptocurrency. But there is a sector where the blockchain gains special attention: The value chain.<br>

            <p>\
In this article, I will describe the process of creating a Solar System in JavaScript using the Three.js library.</p>
<h2 id="gettingtowork"><strong>Getting to work</strong></h2>
<p>Firstly, we need to create the structure of the application. In order to focus on the 3D graphics and not the build or other attributes of modern applications, we will make the <code>index.html</code>, add Three.js via cdn, and create a <code>#root</code> element, which will be our scene.</p>
<p>\
Secondly, we will use CSS to stretch the <code>#root</code> element on full screen.</p>
<p>\
Thirdly, we need to store the textures for the objects, so I created a directory <code>/textures</code>. In order for the browser to access the textures, you can use a local server to view the <code>index.html</code>.</p>
<h2 id="creatingascene"><strong>Creating a Scene</strong></h2>
<p>In Three.js, to display, see and visualize something, we need a scene, a camera, and a visualization tool:</p>

            I wakened shortly after sunrise. The pale May sunshine was showering through the spruces, and a chill, inspiring wind was tossing the boughs about.
“Felix, wake up,” I whispered, shaking him.
“What’s the matter?” he murmured reluctantly.
“It’s morning. Let’s get up and go down and out. I can’t wait another minute to see the places father has told us of.”
We slipped out of bed and dressed, without arousing Dan, who was still slumbering soundly, his mouth wide open, and his bed-clothes kicked off on the floor. I had hard work to keep Felix from trying to see if he could “shy” a marble into that tempting open mouth. I told him it would waken Dan, who would then likely insist on getting up and accompanying us, and it would be so much nicer to go by ourselves for the first time.
Everything was very still as we crept downstairs. Out in the kitchen we heard some one, presumably Uncle Alec, lighting the fire; but the heart of house had not yet begun to beat for the day.
We paused a moment in the hall to look at the b [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has been forced to make "drastic cuts" to production forecasts for its Vision Pro mixed reality headset due to the complexity of its design and difficulties in production, reported the <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b6f06bde-17b0-4886-b465-b561212c96a9">Financial Times</a></em> on Monday.

<br/>
Apple's $3,500 headset is set to go on sale early next year, but analysts have suggested the lengthy gap between its unveiling at WWDC in June and official launch could be more to do with supply chain problems than a way to give developers time to create apps for the device.

According to the paywalled report, Apple is said to have been unhappy with the productivity of manufacturing partners tasked with supplying the two micro-OLED displays for the wearer's eyes and the outward-facing curved lent [...]<br>

            iPhone users in Australia can now receive next-hour precipitation forecasts and notifications from the Weather app, according to an updated <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211777">Apple support document</a>.

"Next-hour precipitation forecasts and precipitation notifications are available for Australia, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States," the document says. "The information is provided by Apple using data from national weather services."

Apple says next-hour precipitation forecasts are "hyperlocal" and "down to the minute." The Weather app can send iPhone users a push notification if it is going to rain in the next hour, and shows how much rainfall is expected by the minute. The feature has been available in the U.S. since the release of iOS 14 in 2020.

The two companies had a prior licensing deal that was set to expire at the end of 2023, and the new deal will replace the one that is ending. Nokia and Apple have not announced the terms of the deal, but Nokia will be receiving payments from Apple.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-06-30 12:55:22-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Popular third-party Reddit app Apollo is set to shut down after today as Reddit will be implementing its paid API changes tomorrow. Apollo's shuttering was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/08/apollo-shutting-down-june-30/">announced earlier in June</a> after developer Christian Selig was unable to work out a deal with Reddit to keep the app functional.

<br/>
Reddit as of tomorrow will be charging third-party developers who use its API. Every 1,000 API calls will be priced at $0.24, with 50 million available for $12,000. With the number of users that Apollo has and the average API calls used per person, Selig calculated that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/31/reddit-api-changes-pricing-apollo/">he would need to pay</a> $1.7 million per month or $20 million per year to keep Apollo function [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Twitter appears to be adopting support for picture-in-picture mode on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, with some Twitter users reporting access to a feature that allows them to watch Twitter videos while doing other tasks on the ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌.

<br/>
Starting a video in Twitter and then swiping out of the app leaves the video player open, so Twitter users can use other apps while continuing to watch video content from the social network. 
<br/>
<br/>
Twitter has had an in-app picture-in-picture option previously, but the new feature allows Twitter video to be watched while using other apps, similar to how YouTube and other video content apps work on iPhones and iPads.
