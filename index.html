<br/>
For instance, in a <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/apple-watch-estimates-and-predictions-apple-watch%E4%BC%B0%E7%AE%97%E8%88%87%E9%A0%90%E6%B8%AC-71aaeea2ffd4">post on Medium</a> today, Kuo said the Apple Watch will not be equipped with a micro-LED display or blood glucose monitoring in 2024. He believes these features are at least two years away from being added to the Apple Watch.
<br/>
<br/>
It's unclear if Kuo's prediction rules out the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/13/gurman-apple-watch-x-redesign-planned/">rumored "Apple Watch X"</a> next year. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said a significantly overhauled "Apple Watch X" would launch in either 2024  [...]<br>

Apple does not provide details on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware, so it is unclear what's new.
