The full ruling is under seal as of now due to confidentiality requests from Apple and AliveCor, but the filing makes it clear that the case went in Apple's favor and the Cupertino company was not found to have engaged in anticompetitive behavior.

AliveCor claimed that its "SmartRhythm" app that worked with its ECG KardiaBand was targeted several times by Apple for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> rule violations, and then rendered non-functional with a change to the Apple Watch heart rhythm algorithm in watchOS 5.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Over the course of the last few months, Apple has been experimenting with different camera bump designs for the standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models. We outlined <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/early-iphone-16-prototypes/">three of Apple's prototype designs</a> back in December, but now Apple has shifted focus once again.
