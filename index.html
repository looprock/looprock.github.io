            <p>Imagine you have a fabulous idea to drive more sales on Etsy by giving out <em>free ice cream</em> with every purchase. How would you know if it will actually work?</p>
<p>One way to test this out is to run an <strong>experiment</strong>! An experiment is a learning tool that can help us see if a new change really affects user behavior and key metrics we care about. At Etsy, we run nearly 2000 experiments a year for testing new ideas to improve the user experience for our buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>For our ice cream idea, we could set up our experiment as an A/B test on the listing page, where one group of users (the “control” group) sees the usual “Buy it now” button, while the other (the "treatment" group) sees a shiny new version that says, “Buy it now and get a FREE ICE CREAM!”.</p>

            Buried within iOS 26 is a hidden history that lets you see every call you've ever exchanged with a specific contact, potentially going back years. You might not know it, but you can access this detailed call history on your iPhone in seconds.
