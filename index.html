Apple has reportedly been working on its own modem since 2018, as it seeks to move away from Qualcomm's component currently used in iPhones. The timeframe for launching the modem has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-in-house-5g-modem-delays/">slipped several times</a> and is now expected to be ready around 2026, and Gurman now hears that Apple has plans for the chip appearing in other Apple devices further down the line.

Starting with the 9th generation iPad, Amazon has the 64GB Wi-Fi model for $249.00, down from $329.00. This is a match of the best price we've ever tracked on this iPad, and it's a great entry-level option for kids or family members who don't need a tablet for intensive tasks.
