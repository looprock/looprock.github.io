            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-12 19:01:03-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today announced its <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/retail/hornsby/">store at the Westfield Hornsby shopping mall</a>, in Hornsby, Australia, will be permanently closing next month.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1018892" height="756" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/Apple-Store-Logo.jpg" width="1344"/>
<br/>
Hornsby is a suburb of Sydney, on the Upper North Shore. Apple opened its store there in 2011, and it will close for good on October 4, at 5 p.m. local time.
<br/>
<br/>
In a statement shared with some Australian media outlets a few months ago, Apple said it had decided not to renew its lease at Westfield Hornsby. Apple said all affected retail employees would be given the opportunity to work at Apple's nearby store <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/retail/chatswoodchase/">at the Chatswood Chase shopping mall</a>, in Chatswood, which is set to reopen in October.

            iOS 26 adds a new Hearing Protection setting for AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods Pro 3 in some countries across Europe and the Middle East, such as Belgium, Czechia, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Türkiye, and the United Arab Emirates.

<br/>
Specifically, there is a new "EN 352 Protection" setting in these countries. When this setting is turned on, Apple's website says the Hearing Protection feature on AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods Pro 3 complies with the European hearing protection standard EN 352, by limiting the maximum volume level of media playback to 82 dBA.

<br/>
When a set of AirPods Pro 2 or AirPods Pro 3 are paired to an iPhone, this new setting can be turned on or off in the Settings app, by tapping on your AirPods, selecting Hearing Protection, and adjusting the "EN 352 Protection" toggle switch.

iPhone 17 Pro models have a new design with an aluminum unibody, but radio signals cannot pass through metal. The reintroduced antenna window, which likely remains made of glass  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's claim that the Apple Watch Series 11 offers 24 hours of battery life has drawn scrutiny as closer examination of Apple's own testing data reveals that the increase from the Series 10's 18-hour rating is largely attributable to changes in testing methodology rather than a major hardware change.

<br/>
Apple lists the Apple Watch Series 11 as capable of lasting up to 24 hours on a single charge, a notable increase over the Series 10's 18-hour claim, which had been the company's published standard since the launch of the original Apple Watch in 2015.
