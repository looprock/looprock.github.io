            With iOS 17.2, iPadOS 17.2, and tvOS 17.2, Apple removed the option to purchase TV shows and movies from the iTunes Store apps, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/ios-17-2-itunes-store-tv-movie-removed/">redirecting customers</a> to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app instead. Unfortunately, Apple's move to consolidate purchasing and viewing in the ‌Apple TV‌ app has done away with wishlists, and customers who used the feature got no warning about their elimination.

            Apple has agreed to <a href="http://petersfamilysharingplan.com">settle a class action lawsuit</a> over Family Sharing, and will pay out $25 million to put an end to the case. First filed in 2019, the lawsuit accused Apple of misrepresenting the way that subscriptions to third-party apps worked with the Family Sharing feature.

<br/>
While Family Sharing allows participants to share subscriptions with one another, app developers can opt out of allowing a single subscription to be shared among multiple people. Not all subscriptions can be shared because of the opt out policy, which is what led to the lawsuit.
<br/>
<br/>
Though Apple has agreed to a settlement, the company says it did nothing wrong and denies making misleading misrepresentations. Apple decided to avoid the potential cost and burden of a jury trial.

            Earlier this month, Twelve South launched the <a href="https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/butterfly-2-in-1-magsafe-charger?_pos=1&amp;_sid=e1b3bb14a&amp;_ss=r&amp;sscid=c1k7_ikhz3&amp;source=shareasale">ButterFly 2-in-1 MagSafe Charger</a>, and it may be the best multi-device travel charger that's come out to date. The "ButterFly" name comes from the shape, as it has two magnetic sides connected by a small strap in the middle.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iPhone 17 Pro models in 2025 will be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip, according to Jeff Pu, an analyst who covers companies within Apple's supply chain.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
In a research note this week with Hong Kong-based investment firm Haitong International Securities, Pu said the chip could be a long-term threat to Broadcom, which currently supplies Apple with a combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip for iPhones.
<br/>
<br/>
Pu believes Apple will expand its in-house Wi-Fi chip to the entire iPhone 18 series in 2026. He did not share any additional details about the chip.

The current Apple Watch Ultra has a display size of 1.93-inches, whereas the upcoming microLED model is apparently due to feature a 2.12-inch screen.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In watchOS 10.2, you can enable a swipe gesture to switch between Apple Watch faces more easily, just like you used to be able to in watchOS 9. Keep reading to learn how it's done.

<br/>
If you are a long-time Apple Watch user, you probably remember a time when it was possible to switch watch faces with a simple swipe gesture across the display. That was the default interaction in watchOS 9, but then Apple removed the gesture with the upgrade to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple changed the interaction because of user complaints that it was too easy to accidentally change watch faces. But for anyone who never had this problem, Apple just made things harder – by requiring a long press before swiping to change the active watch face.
