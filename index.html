Many homes have non-deadbolt doors for side entries, garage doors, home offices, basements, and storage rooms, and these kind of door setups do not work with traditional smart locks that require a deadbolt. The U300 lever lock is one of the first smart locks created for these types of doors.
<br/>
<br/>
The U300 replaces a traditional lever or knob, offering smart functionality and the ability to keep an eye on who is coming or going.

The U300 is built with the latest Thread protocol and it is Matter-enabled, so it can be added to an Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit&lt;/</a> [...]<br>

            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> has expanded the availability of cycling routes in the southern hemisphere by adding support for New Zealand.

Apple first added cycling directions to ‌‌Apple Maps‌‌ in iOS 14, providing specific directions for bike riders with bike lanes, bike paths, and bike-friendly routes that highlight steep inclines, stairs, and other obstacles.
<br/>
<br/>
Prior to this expansion, cycling directions in ‌Apple Maps‌ were primarily available in select countries and major cities across North America, Europe, and parts of Asia. As for Oceania, the feature was previously limited to Australia, so the addition of New Zealand significantly enhances its coverage in the region.

<br/>
The Oura Ring 4 introduces "Smart Sensing" technology, which the company claims enhances data accuracy by adapting to the specific contours of an individual's finger. This new algorithm reportedly improves blood oxygen sensing accuracy by 30% over the Oura Ring 3, and reduces gaps in heart rate tracking. The ring's sensors are also now recessed, which is said to provide a more comfortable fit for all-day wear.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Now that Apple doesn't include power adapters with new iPhones, you have to supply your own, and it can be a little confusing figuring out what you need specifically to get the fastest charging speeds. Apple added another layer of complexity this year with upgraded <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> charging for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models, a feature that also requires specific hardware.

<br/>
<h2 id="usb-c">USB-C</h2>
<br/>
All of the ‌iPhone 16‌ models can charge from 0 to 50 percent in approximately 30 minutes. You need Apple's $19 20W adapter or better for fast charging, and if you already had an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> that could fast charge, you probably have the hardware you need.
