            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>\
Most problems we face at work involve people. We think we know others, how they think, and what drives them. But most of the time, we’re wrong. We look at others from our self-centered view of the world and make assumptions about other people’s behaviors and actions.</p>
<p>\
Others seem to be a source of our problem, not because they are who we think they are, but how we interpret them—what assumptions we make about them, what beliefs we impose, and what expectations we have from them.</p>
<p>\
You can’t be empathetic towards others and lead with your beliefs and notions. To build empathy at work, you have to be less wrong when judging other people’s behaviors and actions. You have to stop making assumptions about their circumstances and motivations. You have to step into their shoes to understand what they’re really thinking.</p>

Apple does not have an online store or retail stores in Israel, so the speakers would be sold at authorized resellers in the country.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-07-20 10:58:01+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The article explores Multi-Armed Bandits (MABs), a reinforcement learning technique used to balance exploration (trying new options) and exploitation (using the current best option). It introduces various MAB algorithms like ε-greedy, UCB, and Thompson Sampling. The ε-greedy method exploits the best known option most of the time, but also explores new options. UCB, on the other hand, considers the estimated reward and associated uncertainty. Thompson Sampling, a Bayesian approach, uses a probabilistic action selection. MABs have wide-ranging applications in advertising, healthcare, web optimization, dynamic pricing, network routing, and machine learning. Their balance of exploration and exploitation makes them ideal for decision-making in uncertain environments.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's launch of the iPhone 15 series could be delayed by a "few weeks," pushing the debut of the company's next-generation smartphone lineup beyond its usual September timeframe, according to Wamsi Mohan, a global securities analyst at Bank of America.

Mohan shared his prediction in a research note obtained by <em><a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/apple-earnings-iphone-sales-delay-47247f90">Barrons</a></em> after conducting channel checks in Apple's supply chain. Mohan said the launch looked like it could slip into the fourth quarter, which runs through October to December, and he was concerned that guidance for the third quarter could disappoint Wall Street analysts as a result of the possible delay.

Mohan now sees September quarter revenue of $87.1 billion, well below consensus at $91. [...]<br>

            While rumors about second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> have been slim so far, there are a handful of features that the over-ear headphones could adopt from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/19/beats-studio-pro-debut/">new Beats Studio Pro</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/07/new-airpods-pro-with-h2-chip-more/">second-generation AirPods Pro</a>.

            Netflix today quietly eliminated its most <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926">affordable ad-free plan</a> in the United States and the United Kingdom, raising the price of ad-free streaming options.

<br/>
In the U.S., the Basic plan was priced at $9.99 per month, and with its removal, ad-free streaming now starts at $15.49 per month. Netflix subscribers can opt for the $6.99 per month "Standard with ads" plan, but that price point includes advertisements.

New customers who want an ad-free streaming experience will now need to pay $5.50 more without the Basic plan. As noted by <em><a href="https://www.cordbusters.co.uk/netflix-pricing-basic-tier-axed-uk-us/">Cord Busters</a></em>, this shift will put more focus on Netflix's ad-supported plan, and it is a move that the company already teste [...]<br>
