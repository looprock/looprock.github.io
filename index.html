            <b>Published:</b> 2025-07-22 04:16:06-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, Apple is introducing several new features for its Messages app, and this one in particular is likely to make interacting with message bubbles way less frustrating. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010448" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/ios-26-messages-select-copy-paste.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
When you tap and hold on any message bubble, a new "Select" option now appears alongside the familiar copy and reaction choices, finally solving one of Messages' most persistent frustrations.
<br/>
<br/>
The Select feature allows you to highlight specific portions of text within a message rather than copying the entire message. Simply tap and hold any message bubble, choose "Select" from the contextual menu, and then use the drag handles to highlight exactly the text you need. It works across all message types, including text messages and iMessages.

The new selective text feature should come in handy in a range of scen [...]<br>

The iPhone 16 series drove Apple's performance, accounting for over 55% of the company's shipments in the quarter. The data suggests that users have been keen to upgrade to Apple's latest flagship devices, but older models like the iPhone 15 and iPhone 13 continued attracting buyers across lower price points.

However, Apple's latest entry-level edition to the lineup, the iPhone 16e, appears to have struggled to gain traction after its February launch. Canalys analyst Sanyam Chaurasia [...]<br>

A selection of public beta testers and developers who have opted into either the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15 developer beta or the ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15 public beta are instead receiving the macOS Tahoe public beta. The beta that Apple is distributing has a build number of 25A5316i, which is newer than the 25A5306g build number of the third macOS Tahoe developer beta.

macOS Tahoe is showing up for Apple silicon Mac users who do not have Rosetta 2 installed. Most Apple silicon Macs <em>do</em> have Rosetta installed, and those Macs won't detect the mistaken beta release.

<br/>
Apple could potentially end up having to drop a key supplier of iPhone OLED panels, following a preliminary ruling issued by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that found Chinese display maker BOE violated federal trade secret laws.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The ITC found that BOE and seven of its subsidiaries misappropriated Samsung Display's trade secrets to manufacture panels, violating Section 337 of the Tariff Act. The commission has proposed banning BOE's OLED imports and ordering existing U.S. inventories be removed from sale.
