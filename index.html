            <b>Published:</b> 2023-10-17 09:10:49-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Over the past four days, there were several conflicting rumors about Apple announcing new iPads, a new Apple Pencil, or a combination of those two things. In the end, the only product announced was a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/new-apple-pencil-with-usb-c-announced/">lower-cost Apple Pencil with a USB-C port</a>.

Postgres supports relational data, and it supports non-relational data like JSON.  This ability is often called <a class="txt2html" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-model_database" style="text-decoration: none;">multi-model.</a>
</p>
<p>However, I am not sure if that is the right focus — it highlights Postgres's ability to store <em>two</em> types of data workloads in the same system, but it doesn't highlight the power of supporting data that

<p>People normally say, "Oh, I can store my financial data using Postgres's relational data types, and I can store my browser data in JSONB."  However, what about storing most of your financial data

            Apple's quarterly iPad revenue will significantly decline in the fourth quarter of 2023 on a year-over-year basis, according to estimated figures shared today by Erik Woodring, an analyst at investment firm Morgan Stanley.
<br/>

<br/>
Morgan Stanley estimates that Apple will report iPad revenue of $7.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023, which would be a decline of approximately 23% compared to the $9.4 billion that Apple reported for the segment in the year-ago quarter.
<br/>

Both <em>The Information</em> and <em>Bloomberg</em> have previously claimed that Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/17/apple-cheaper-ar-vr-headset/">working on a more affordable version</a> of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset. The initial version set to launch early next year will be priced at $3,500, placing it out of reach of many Apple customers.

"More often than not, the company debuts new laptops and iPads in October — about a month after the latest iPhone and watch get out the door," said Gurman, in his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-15/apple-october-2023-executive-promotions-new-vps-of-retail-software-operations-lnrh4t94"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today.
