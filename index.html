            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If you've been hearing a chiming sound from your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2 case when the AirPods are charging, it's a feature that Apple added with the launch of Hearing Health last year.

<br/>
In a <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/airpods/hearing-health-features-airpods-pro-2-devd9aac5b42/web">support guide</a>, Apple says that the ‌AirPods Pro‌ may play a sound every so often while in the case to ensure the microphones and speakers are working as intended. From Apple:
<br/>
<blockquote>To help ensure that your AirPods microphones and speakers are operating at their best (for example, to help provide high-quality hearing test results), your AirPods may periodically play a quiet chime when they're in their charging case.</blockquote>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Streaming service Disney+ is set to gain support for HDR10+ in the near future, according to an announcement made at CES by HDR10+ Technologies (via <em><a href="https://www.mediaplaynews.com/disney-latest-big-streamer-to-deploy-hdr10/">MediaPlayNews</a></em>). HDR10+ offers improved brightness and contrast compared to HDR10, and unlike Dolby Vision, there are no licensing fees.

<br/>
Disney+ already supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision, but HDR10+ titles will be coming to the service in 2025. Dolby Vision and HDR10+ are similar, but some TV sets don't support Dolby Vision due to the licensing fees. Samsung TVs, for example, don't offer Dolby Vision content, so Samsung TV owners can look forward to better quality when streaming HDR10+ Disney+ content.
