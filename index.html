            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The debate over whether 8GB of RAM is sufficient for a Mac has long been a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/8gb-ram-m3-macbook-pro-like-16-gb-pc/">topic of contention</a>. The controversy goes back to at least 2012, when Apple launched the first MacBook Pro with Retina display, which started with 8GB of RAM. Apple still offers 8GB as the base configuration for its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-m3-macbook-pros/">14-inch MacBook Pro</a>, not to mention its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">M3 iMac</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">latest MacBook Air</a> models. Coupled with the significant cost of upgrading to higher memory options, Apple's decision has once again sparked discussions about the adequacy and value of this configuration.

            Apple appears to be internally testing iOS 17.4.1 for the iPhone, based on evidence of the software update in our website's logs this week.

Our logs have revealed the existence of several iOS 17 versions before Apple released them, ranging from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-preparing-ios-17-0-3/">iOS 17.0.3</a> to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/05/apple-preparing-ios-17-3-1/">iOS 17.3.1</a>.

            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> is still months away from being unveiled, but there are already several rumors and expectations for the software update, as outlined below.
<br/>

<br/>
iOS 18 is rumored to include new ChatGPT-inspired generative AI features for Siri and many built-in apps, and Apple plans to add RCS support to the Messages app for an improved texting experience between iPhones and Android devices. The update is also rumored to have some design changes, but details remain slim.

iOS 18 is expected to be announced at Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in June, and widely released in September.

The ‌MacBook Air‌ is available in 13.6-inch and 15.3-inch sizes, just like the prior-generation versions. Apple did not introduce notable design changes this time around, so most of what's new is on the inside.

An M3 chip is the main upgrade, and this is the same chip that Apple already used in the 14-inch MacBook Pro. When we benchmarked our test unit with an 8-core GPU and 10-core GPU, we got a Geekbench single-core score of 3106 and a multi-core score of 11690.

<br/>
The drawings show a design that is similar to that of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, with a small number of changes relating to some of the buttons. The Action button is slightly longer, now resembling a similar length to one of the volume buttons, but with a slightly wider shape to distinguish it. The all-new "Capture" button is present on the left-hand side of the device where the mmWave antenna was located on previous models. While it is a similar length to the Side button, it is completely flush with the device.
