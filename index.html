            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-21 14:31:41-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            All five iPhone 16 models offer an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-16-edit-spatial-audio-in-video-audio-mix/">Audio Mix feature</a> in the Photos app that lets you edit the sound of a video after it is recorded. For example, you can reduce the background noise in a video, so that the person speaking on camera sounds more clear.
<br/>

<br/>
Starting with iOS 26, Apple is allowing third-party apps to offer the same Audio Mix controls as the Photos app does on the iPhone 16 and newer.
<br/>
<br/>
Audio Mix, powered by machine learning, offers four primary options:<ul>
<br/>
<li><strong>Standard</strong>: Play the original audio you recorded.</li>
<br/>
<li><strong>In-Frame</strong>: Reduce sounds and voices from sources not visible in the video frame.</li>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is making Cinematic mode video capture available beyond its Camera app on the iPhone.
<br/>

<br/>
In a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/319/">WWDC 2025 session</a> earlier this month, Apple introduced a new API that allows developers of third-party camera apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kino-pro-video-camera/id6472380172">Kino</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/filmic-pro-video-camera/id436577167">Filmic Pro</a> to offer Cinematic mode video recording capabilities in their apps, if they choose to implement it.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple introduced Cinematic mode on iOS 15, and it is available on all iPhone 13 models and newer. Inspired by Hollywood films, the mode allows users to record video with a shallow depth of field and automatic focus changes between subjects.

Apple has also moved The Parent Presentation to the bottom of its <a href="https://www.apple.com/education/college-students/">College Students page</a>, effectively burying it. When we reported on the marketing campaign yesterday, the presentation was prominently featured at the top of the page.

<br/>
It is unclear why Apple is suddenly hiding the ad, or if it will return. Apple did not immediately respond to our request for comment.

On social media, some people said that the ad was cringe or gross, so perhaps Apple pulled the video due to overly negati [...]<br>

Apple's CEO Tim Cook, former CFO Luca Maestri, and current CFO Kevan Parekh are also named as defendants in the case, which still needs to be certified by a judge.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is testing new Purple and Green color options for the iPhone 17 base model, according to new information shared by a leaker known as <a href="https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1936061526147776765">Majin Bu</a>.

<br/>
In a <a href="https://majinbuofficial.com/phone-17-new-purple-and-green-colors-in-testing-for-base-models/">blog post</a> today, Majin Bu said that only one of the two new colors might make the final cut, with Purple apparently being the more likely choice.
<br/>
<br/>
The base model iPhone 16 is available in five colors: Ultramarine, Teal, Pink, White, and Black.

            Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/retail/perthcity/">announced</a> that it will soon be opening a new retail store at Forrest Place, a pedestrianized area in the heart of Perth, Australia.

<br/>
The store will be in a historic building originally built for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, at the corner of Forrest Place and Murray Street. Apple is taking over a space that was previously occupied by Australian swimwear retailer City Beach.

Apple already has a store in central Perth on nearby Hay Street. That location, opened in 2010, will be permanently closing on Wednesday, June 25, and the newer and larger Forrest Place store will be holding its grand opening on Friday, June 27 at 9 a.m. local time.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is hiding a new ringtone within iOS 26.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006157" height="592" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/ios-26-call-holding.jpg" width="1052"/>
<br/>
The new ringtone is an alternative version of the existing Reflection ringtone, which has been the default ringtone since the iPhone X was released in 2017. It was discovered within the code for the first developer beta of iOS 26, but it remains hidden, so you will not find it in the list of ringtones available in the Settings app for now.
<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear if Apple will move forward with releasing the ringtone in a later iOS 26 beta version.
<br/>
<br/>
The new ringtone was shared on X yesterday <a href="https://x.com/8810cfw/status/1935248131157049700">by the account @8810cfw</a>, in a post that was later reposted by the account <a href="https://x.com/VNchocoTaco">ShrimpApplePro</a>.
