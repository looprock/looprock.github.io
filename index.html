            <b>Published:</b> 2024-08-06 15:03:17-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Aqara today introduced <a href="https://www.aqara.com/us/product/presence-sensor-fp1e/">a new Presence Sensor</a> that is designed to keep smart home products like lights turned on when someone is in the room. The Presence Sensor FP1E uses Zigbee, but it is able to connect to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> and other smart home platforms through an Aqara Matter bridge.

<br/>
The Presence Sensor FP1E uses millimeter wave technology to detect even minute human movements for prompt presence detection that can be used to trigger ‌HomeKit‌ automations. If you want to have a light come on in the laundry room when you go inside, for example, you need a HomeKit-compatible sensor.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Flight tracking app <a href="https://www.flightyapp.com">Flighty</a> was today updated with a new feature that is designed to provide users with additional information on the reason behind delayed flights.

<br/>
Flighty is using aviation authority data and machine learning to provide early warnings of delays, and when a delay is official, the reason for the delay. Most delays are due to airspace issues and late aircraft, both of which Flighty will monitor.
<br/>
<br/>
The app is able to predict delays "hours in advance," and give information to Flighty users that airlines often decline to share. The result is more control over travel plans.<blockquote>For example, the airline might delay your flight by 30 minutes ... and then another hour. But with these updates, Flighty 4 can tell you that's likely to be at least a five-hour d</blockquote> [...]<br>

            Apple is preparing to release a minor iOS 17.6.1 update for the iPhone, according to a post shared today by an anonymous leaker on X, formerly known as Twitter. The leaker has a private account, so we are not identifying it or linking to it, but they have proven to be a consistently accurate source for upcoming iOS updates.

As Apple TV owners will know, it is not possible to browse the web on the set-top box, so web links are not something you traditionally come across in the tvOS interface. That looks set to change with tvOS 18.
<br/>
<br/>
In the Apple TV app, Apple is promoting Immersive Videos for Apple Vision Pro, and these include a new button in the description screen that when pressed AirDrops a web link to the user's nearby iOS device.  The feature was discovered by Sigmund Judge in the fifth beta of tvOS 18 that was released to developers on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/apple-seeds-tvos-18-beta-5-to-developers/">Monday</a>.
