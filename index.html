            The original Apple Watch was released in April 2015, and we are coming up on the 10th anniversary of Apple's first wearable device. With such a landmark anniversary on the horizon, rumors are coalescing around a notable 10-year anniversary update that we could see in 2024 or 2025.

Apple in 2017 unveiled the "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> X" to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå, so Apple could have similar plans for the Apple Watch.

            Apple this week filed a <a href="https://launchstudio.bluetooth.com/ListingDetails/187538">listing for a 2023 watchOS subsystem</a> in the Bluetooth product database.

Musk made the comment in response to a tweet asking whether there was a reason to block someone instead of muting someone on the social network.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WhatsApp has released an update allowing iPhone and Android users to send photos over the messaging platform in high resolution, finally addressing the service's low quality image sharing limitation.

Previously, WhatsApp users sending photos would see the images automatically compressed and the resolution reduced to 920 x 1280 to save storage space and keep image-sharing fast over low bandwidth data connections.

After updating, they'll have the option to send images to friends and family in "HD quality," which equates to 3024 x 4032 resolution. The rollout of the feature was announced by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg via a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/4/videos/2577125352453919/">Facebook post</a>.

            Apple has joined a coalition of U.S. businesses in protest at India's sudden introduction of tech import restrictions last month, claiming the move will damage New Delhi's ambitions to become a global manufacturing hub and harm consumers (via <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-18/apple-intel-among-top-us-firms-to-decry-new-india-licensing-rules?srnd=technology-vp#xj4y7vzkg">Bloomberg</a></em>).

The reposts tab hasn't yet appeared for most people using the iOS Threads app, but it can be viewed on the web if you visit your Threads profile page.

<p>The office lacks offices, which is the core problem with the anti-WFH people. One, I have a whole desk studio setup for all the videos and podcasts I do. There is no place for that at a regular white-collar office. Two, I b</p> [...]<br>
