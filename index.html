            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has stopped signing the iPadOS 17.7.7 update that was released earlier this week for devices unable to run versions of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, meaning that users will not be able to install the update even if they see it available in Software Update. Affected devices include the sixth-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, the 10.5-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, and the second-generation 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌.

<br/>
The company has not provided a reason for unsigning the update, but there are a number of reports on the MacRumors forums, Reddit, and elsewhere from users who have experienced issues logging into apps after updating their devices.

<br/>
In the video, Microsoft says the top-end Windows PCs with Copilot+ branding are up to 58% faster than the previous-generation MacBook Air with the M3 chip, based on Cinebench 2024 multi-core CPU benchmark results.
