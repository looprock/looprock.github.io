            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple Watch owners have been voicing their frustration online over changes to the Workout app that Apple introduced in watchOS 26, with many finding the redesigned interface makes starting exercises difficult and exasperating.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005235" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/watchos-26-workout-app.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
When Apple launched watchOS 26 in September, the Workout app went from large, easily tapped workout tiles to a scrolling, corner-button interface. Instead of tapping a workout once to begin, users now select the workout type, and then tap a smaller play button that appears after a brief animation. Apple has also integrated music and podcast setup directly into the Workout app itself, so users can configure audio to automatically begin playing when they start exercising.

However, many of the changes appear to have become a major source of frustration over the last couple of months, b [...]<br>

<p>We have two ChatGPT subscriptions and a Claude subscription, so that&rsquo;s $60/month you put into that.</p>
<p>If I cut my Apple One subscription, you get $40/month. This would mostly mean moving all my photos to Google Photos instead of Apple Photos and using Google Drive instead of iCloud. I guess I&rsquo;d miss out on Apple TV+.</p>
