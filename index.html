To address this issue, one potential solution involves segmenting the project into multiple modules. Compiling these modules in parallel and solely recompiling modified portions reduces the overall compilation time. However, a predicament arises: how can we effectively share common library dependencies and their respective versions, while evading compilation errors and the necessity to manually scrutinize Gradle files in each module to prevent synchronization issues?<br>

In <a href="https://doordash.news/merchant/introducing-doordashs-biggest-app-updates-in-a-decade/">an announcement on Wednesday</a>, DoorDash says it will start giving couriers the ability to earn hourly rates on top of tips.</p>
<p id="naKkyu">With the update, couriers will now see the option to “earn by time,” which offers a guaranteed hourly minimum rate for the time they spend on making deliveries. According to DoorDash, the clock starts as soon as a courier accepts an order and ends when it’s dropped off. </p>
