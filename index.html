As Netflix increasingly adopts eBPF [<a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/extending-vector-with-ebpf-to-inspect-host-and-container-performance-5da3af4c584b">1</a>, <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/how-netflix-uses-ebpf-flow-logs-at-scale-for-network-insight-e3ea997dca96">2</a>], applying the same rigor to these applications as we do to other managed services is imperative. Striking a balance between eBPF’s benefits and system load is crucial, ensuring it enhances rather than hinders our operational efficiency.
