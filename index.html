As we were gearing up for launch, we wanted to ensure it would go as smoothly as possible. To do this, we devised a novel way to simulate the projected traffic weeks ahead of launch by building upon the traffic migration framework described <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/migrating-critical-traffic-at-scale-with-no-downtime-part-1-ba1c7a1c7835">here</a>.

            Apple plans to add the original 12-inch MacBook to its obsolete products list on June 30, according to an internal memo obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>. Once classified as obsolete, the laptop will no longer be eligible for repairs or service at Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers, as parts will no longer be available.

Apple classifies a product as technologically obsolete once more than seven years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale.

            Apple today seeded the second betas of upcoming iOS 16.6 and iPadOS 16.6 updates to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test out the software head of its official launch. The public betas come just a day after Apple provided the second betas to developers.

<br/>
Those who have signed up their accounts for Apple's free beta testing program can enable the beta by opening up the Settings app, going to General, selecting Software Update, tapping on Beta Updates, and selecting the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/">iOS 16</a> Public Beta option.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 16.6 seems to be a relatively minor update, although Apple does appear to be laying the groundwork for the launch of the previously announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/19/ios-16-6-imessage-contact-key-verification/">iMessage Contact</a> [...]<br>

            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a> customers who have opted to create a high-yield Apple Savings account through Goldman Sachs have been experiencing issues attempting to withdraw their money, according to a report from <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/apple-savings-account-customers-say-its-hard-to-get-their-money-out-of-goldman-sachs-bd8b9ccb">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>.

<br/>
Multiple customers who transferred thousands of dollars to the Apple Savings account have had to wait weeks for money transfers in some cases, and some customers have also had money disappear. Kevin Smyth from Minnesota, for example, attempted to transfer $10,000 from his Apple account to U.S. Bank in mid-May, but Goldman Sachs would not complete the transfer.

            The action-adventure survival game "No Man's Sky" is now available for the Mac <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/">on Steam</a>, with "another surprise" from studio Hello Games to follow in the "near future."

<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
At WWDC last year, Apple announced that No Man's Sky would be available for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and Mac would by the end of 2022. Hello Games missed that deadline and the game is finally available for the Mac as of today. Hello Games founder Sean Murray teased two upcoming Apple-related announcements earlier this week. Today, Murray seemingly confirmed that the launch for Mac is one of the two teased announcements, meaning another is soon to follow.

She has to die when the first cold comes, whereas the eggs are to pass the winter in their cozy home. She cannot help deserting the nest. But, if the hatching were earlier and took place in the Spider’s life, I imagine that she would be as devoted to her family as a Bird is.
