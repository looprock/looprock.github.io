            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is facing a new lawsuit from consumers who allege that its claim that the Apple Watch Series 9, SE, and Ultra 2 are "carbon neutral" is misleading, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-sued-over-carbon-neutral-claim-watches-2025-02-27/"><em>Reuters</em></a> reports.

<br/>
Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the lawsuit argues that Apple misrepresented the environmental impact of these three Apple Watch models by relying on carbon offset projects that did not provide genuine carbon reductions. The plaintiffs claim they would not have bought their devices or would have paid less had they known this.

<p>Yes, <strong>“working people”</strong> is a shibboleth in U.S. political discourse, particularly among progressive and labor-oriented politicians. It’s often used as a way to signal alignment with <strong>workers, unions, and the middle or lower class</strong> without explicitly saying “working class,” which can carry more rigid or ideological connotations.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>On the left</strong>, Democrats and labor advocates frequently use “working people” to emphasize economic struggles and the need for policies like higher wages, healthcare, and workers' rights.

<br/>

The first option allows users to request the removal of information like phone number, email address, home address, credit card numbers, login credentials, and more, and if selected, Google will review the request and possibly remove the result.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iOS 18.4, Apple made a small tweak to Safari that could be polarizing because it puts your search history front and center. When you open up a new Safari tab and then tap into the search field, Safari shows your recent search history.

<br/>
In iOS 18.3.1, opening up a new tab and then tapping into search does not show your history, and the view remains on the personalized Safari home page. iOS 18.3.1 has no clear view of prior searches at all, except that a recent search will show up in your suggested results if you search for the same thing again.

While the average customer is unlikely to care about this change, it is a big deal for Apple, which had been working on its own cellular modem since at least 2018.

We are still waiting on C1 modem speed tests, but it is expected that Apple's first modem will provide slower 5G speeds compared to Qualcomm's Snapdragon X71 modem in iPhone 16 models.
