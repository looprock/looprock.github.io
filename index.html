            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is planning to debut a high-end secondary version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a> this year, sitting in the lineup alongside the current model, reports suggest.

Back in September 2025, supply chain analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/07/airpods-pro-3-this-year-per-kuo/">reported</a> that Apple is planning to introduce a successor to the ‌AirPods Pro 3‌ in 2026. This would be somewhat unusual since Apple normally waits around three years to make major changes to the AirPods' hardware. AirPods Pro 2 debuted at the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 14 event in September 2022, and they were updated with a USB-C charging case and a few other tweaks in Se [...]<br>

<br/>
In a new <a href="https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/2013628564223008849?s=20">post on X (Twitter)</a>, the now-retired Counterpoint Research VP said that Chinese leaker Instant Digital's latest explanation of how Apple will shrink the Dynamic Island is what he was alluding to in a report last year.

<br/>
Back in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/23/iphone-18-pro-smaller-dynamic-island-rumor/">June 2025</a>, Young said that while some parts of Apple's Face ID system would move under the display on iPhone 18 Pro models, the devices would retain visible Face ID elements – meaning the Dynamic Island would persist, albeit in a smaller form than on the iPhone 14 Pro t [...]<br>

            Apple will launch a second-generation iPhone Air this year, despite reports that it has been delayed until 2027, according to the Weibo leaker known as <a href="https://weibo.com/5821279480/QnY9bqGZ9">Fixed Focus Digital</a>.

            Over the last few months, rumors around the iPhone 18 Pro's front-panel design have been conflicted, with some supply-chain leaks pointing to under-display Face ID, reports suggesting a top-left hole-punch camera, and debate over whether the familiar Dynamic Island will shrink, shift, or disappear entirely.

<p>Their lack of new ideas and inability to take action gives you a sort of “it’s just about to be good” feel that keeps you playing. Like that feeling that the next pull of the slot machine will be the jackpot.</p>
<p>Also, the memory required for ongoing RPG is vast, the AIs can’t take it.</p>
<p>AI’s can act like an advanced DM’s screen - a bunch of tools - but I’m starting to doubt that they’re any good at the role playing part of DM’ing.</p>
<p>I’ve been <a href="https://youtu.be/OV_ddU4BFvE?si=EK4V2e_8JMLH-AP3">optimistic for awhile</a>, and done a lot of work to get the AI good at playing D&amp;D. I need to think on all this more.</p>

In a <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/luXVWtplQ9Bokb">blog post</a> last year, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that he expected all of the new iPhone models released later this year to be equipped with 12GB of RAM. That would include the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and iPhone Fold, and it would match the 12GB of RAM included in the iPhone 17 Pro models.

In a research note last week, obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>, analyst Jeff Pu agreed that the iPhone 18 Pro models and iPhone Fold will have 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM.

            <b>Published:</b> 2026-01-19 05:51:28-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Chrome for iOS will soon feature an option for iPhone users to import their Safari data into Google's mobile browser, avoiding the need to perform the transfer on desktop.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-851161" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/Chrome-Feature-22.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Starting in Chrome 145, currently in beta, the new feature will guide users through the process of importing bookmarks, browsing history, and passwords from Safari, since Chrome cannot transfer the data directly because of Apple's privacy rules.
<br/>
<br/>
The process involves manually exporting Safari browsing data to a zip file downloaded to the user's iPhone, and then selecting the file in Chrome for import using the new option. 
<br/>
<br/>
Chrome's interface displays a breakdown of what will be imported, before doing so on the user's confirmation, then the browser offers to delete the zip file as a privacy measure.

            Meta's Threads has now reportedly surpassed its rival X (formerly Twitter) in daily mobile usage globally.

Market intelligence firm <a href="https://www.similarweb.com">Similarweb</a> (via <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/threads-edges-out-x-in-daily-mobile-users-new-data-shows/">TechCrunch</a></em>) reports that Threads recorded 141.5 million daily active users across iOS and Android worldwide as of January 7, 2026, compared with 125 million daily active mobile users for X.
<br/>
<br/>
The data indicates that Threads crossed ahead of X on mobile sometime between late October and early November 2025, following a prolonged period of steady growth rather than a sudden spike.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iPhone 18 Pro models will have a front camera cutout in the top-left corner of the screen alongside a new under-display Face ID system, which will see the Dynamic Island software feature relocated to the same corner. That's according to the <a href="https://youtu.be/mN2Td45Ln5M?si=LbVjQy8KN-ze6mn8">latest YouTube video</a> from Front Page Tech's Jon Prosser.

<br/>
Introduced on the iPhone 14 Pro, the Dynamic Island is the pill-shaped interactive area centered at the top of the screen that expands and contracts to display ongoing activities, while effectively hiding the front camera and Face ID sensor cutouts. 
<br/>
<br/>
Prosser claims that Apple's new under-screen Face ID system will sit next to a top-left camera cutout, meaning the Dynamic Island no longer needs to be centered at the top. Instead,  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 27 is still many months away, but there are already plenty of rumors about new features that will be included in the software update.
<br/>

<br/>
The first beta of iOS 27 will be released during WWDC 2026 in June, and the update should be released to all users with a compatible iPhone in September.
<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said that iOS 27 will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/23/ios-27-two-key-upgrades/">similar to Mac OS X Snow Leopard</a>, in the sense that Apple is apparently focused on improving "quality and underlying performance." However, there will still be some new features, with many of them expected to fall under the Apple Intelligence umbrella.

            AI can be useful. But so many people seem to feel it&#8217;s nothing more than an unpaid intern you can lean on to do all the work you don&#8217;t feel like doing yourself. (And the less said about its misuse to generate a webful of slop, the better.) Like everyone everywhere, police departments are starting [&#8230;]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Ever searched for something specific, only to be met with results that are <em>close, but not quite</em>? On Etsy’s Search Relevance team, that frustration is exactly what we are tackling. Our goal is simple yet ambitious: to help buyers find exactly what they’re looking for, and to help sellers reach the people seeking their special products.</p>
<p>Search plays a central role in that mission. Historically, Etsy’s search models have relied heavily on engagement signals – such as clicks, add-to-carts, and purchases – as proxies for relevance. These signals are objective, but they can also be biased: popular listings get more clicks, even when they’re not the best match for a specific query.</p>
<p>To address this, we introduce semantic relevance as a complementary perspective to engagement, capturing how well a listing aligns with a buyer’s intent as expressed in their query. We developed a <strong>Semantic Relevance Evaluation and Enhancement Framework</strong>, powered by large language models (LLMs). It</p> [...]<br>
