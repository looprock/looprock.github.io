            Apple supplier Corning is facing a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_5681">European Commission-led antitrust probe</a> over potential anticompetitive practices related to its dominant position in the smartphone cover glass market, specifically in relation to its Gorilla Glass technology.

<br/>
The investigation centers on concerns that US-based Corning may have abused its market position by adopting exclusivity contracts to prevent rival glass makers from competing for business with mobile device manufacturers. The Commission is particularly focused on arrangements that allegedly required manufacturers to source "all or nearly all" of their specialized alkali-aluminosilicate glass from Corning.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple appears to be working on a new battery charging feature for iPhone that will show users how much time it will take for their device to reach a full charge.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-971681" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/iPhone-16-Battery-Life-Feature.jpg" width="2000"/>

Code unearthed in the latest iOS 18.2 beta by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/11/05/ios-18-how-long-iphone-charge/">9to5Mac</a></em> references a new "BatteryIntelligence" framework that apparently allows the system to calculate estimated charging completion times. While the feature has yet to be enabled, if Apple does implement it in the public release, iOS 18.2 may be able to notify users about how long it will take their iPhone to reach a specific charge level.

<br/>
Masimo first filed the trade secret lawsuit against Apple in 2020, and there was a jury trial in April 2023. During that trial, the court threw out more than half of Masimo's trade secret claims, but the judge ultimately declared a mistrial because the jury was not able to come to a final decision. Six of seven jurors sided with Apple, while one Masimo holdout would not change her opinion.

<br/>
With the advent of Apple silicon and its unified memory architecture in 2020, the traditional understanding of RAM has evolved, leading to new considerations for users when selecting a memory option. Unlike traditional PC RAM, where separate components like the CPU and GPU each have their own dedicated memory pools, Apple's unified memory architecture allows all processing units to access a single, shared pool of high-bandwidth, low-latency memory. 
<br/>
<br/>
As a result, in Apple silicon systems, data doesn't need to be copied between multiple memory areas, significantly improving speed and power efficiency. By uniting memory, Apple devices with this  [...]<br>

            American automaker General Motors (GM) last year announced it would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/31/general-motors-to-phase-out-apple-carplay/">phasing out support for CarPlay</a> and Android Auto in its new electric vehicles, in favor of its own software platform called Ultifi. The decision has been very controversial, as many drivers consider CarPlay to be a must-have feature in a new vehicle. In 2022, for example, Apple said 79% of U.S. buyers would only consider a vehicle that works with CarPlay.

            Apple News is providing Live Activities support for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, allowing iPhone and iPad users to track electoral results in real time directly from their Lock Screen.

If you have an iPhone 14 Pro or later model running iOS 16.1 or newer, or an iPad running iPadOS 17 or later, you can activate the feature through the Apple News app. Setting it up in advance ensures you won't miss any updates when coverage begins.

In that post, I argued in the affirmative, but also said that it's probably shouldn't be your primary backup mechanism. For that, you probably shouldn't directly use anything that is included in PostgreSQL itself, but rather a well-maintained third-party backup tool such as <a href="https://pgbarman.org/" target="_blank">barman</a> or <a href="https://pgbackrest.org/" target="_blank">pgbackrest</a>.
