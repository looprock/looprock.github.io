            Apple today <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/new-mac-studio-with-m4-max-and-m3-ultra/">updated the Mac Studio</a> with mismatched M4 Max and M3 Ultra chip options. Naturally, this has led people to wonder why Apple opted for an M3 Ultra instead of an M4 Ultra chip, and the answer is fairly interesting.

Apple <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/03/apple-announces-m3-ultra-and-says-not-every-generation-will-see-an-ultra-chip/">told <em>Ars Technica</em>'s Andrew Cunningham</a> that not every generation of M-series chips for Macs will include an "Ultra" chip.
<br/>
<br/>
"When asked why the high-end Mac Studio was getting an M3 Ultra chip instead of an M4 Ultra, Apple told us that not every chip generation will get an 'Ultra' tier," he wrote.

            Apple today announced the next of its M4 Mac models, but how much better really is the M4 chip over its predecessor?

The M4 chip debuted in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> last year, promising around 20% faster performance than the M3 chip in both single and multi-core tasks. All of the key differences between the two chip generations are listed below:

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-05 09:04:26+01:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p><em>One bad apple ruins the bunch.</em></p>
<p>The O-Ring Theory, proposed by economist Michael Kremer in 1993, describes how small failures in complex, interdependent tasks can lead to major breakdowns. Named after the Challenger disaster, where a faulty O-ring caused the shuttle’s destruction, this model applies to production, labor markets, and economic development.</p>
<p>In an O-ring system, tasks must be performed at a consistently high level because a single weak link can compromise the entire process. This leads to high-skill clustering, where talented workers seek equally skilled colleagues, reinforcing economic inequality between firms, industries, and countries.</p>
<p>For example, in tech, a bad developer in a high-stakes project can introduce critical bugs, limiting the success of even the best engineers. This explains why top companies attract and retain top talent—because output depends on every link in the chain functioning well. It also highlights the challenge of improving productivity in</p> [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-05 09:00:33+01:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Median Voter Theory (MVT) suggests that in a majority-rule election, the candidate closest to the median voter’s views will win. Since most voters are partisan and vote predictably, elections are decided by swing voters in the middle. To win, candidates adjust their positions to attract this decisive group, often moving toward the political center.</p>
<p>Developed by Anthony Downs in 1957, MVT explains why general election candidates tend to sound more moderate than during primaries, where they appeal to their base. Over time, this leads to policy convergence, with major parties offering similar centrist policies.</p>
<p>However, MVT assumes politics follows a single left-right spectrum, ignores low voter turnout, and struggles in polarized environments, where candidates may focus more on energizing their base than winning the middle. Despite these flaws, MVT remains a key theory in understanding why democratic elections often favor centrist policies over extreme positions.</p>

            In the latest beta of tvOS 18.4, there are new hints of Apple's work on a smart home hub accessory that's rumored to be coming as soon as this year. <em>MacRumors</em> found that Apple has added ChatKit framework to the tvOS code, which is curious as there is no Messages app available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> or the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>.

The ChatKit framework added to tvOS 18.4 includes reactions and notifications for tapback reactions added to iMessages, like "[person] disliked this" or [person] reacted with [emoji]," which would not be applicable to Apple's current devices that run tvOS.

The ‌2024 ‌iPad Air‌ models have now been discontinued by Apple, but they may still be found refurbished and with third-party resellers for lower prices. As such, some customers may be weighing up whether to buy the 2024 ‌‌iPad Air‌ or the new 2025 models.
