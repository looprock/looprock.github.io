            <b>Published:</b> 2025-07-13 10:20:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>

            Apple plans to release a next-generation Studio Display or equivalent replacement external monitor as soon as early next year, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-10/apple-plans-new-macbook-pro-iphone-17e-and-ipads-by-early-2026"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

In his latest report on Apple's product roadmap for 2026, Gurman said the company is planning to launch its first new Mac external monitor since debuting the Apple Studio Display in 2022. 
<br/>
<br/>
The new version, internally code-named J427, "is currently slated for early 2026," alongside Macs with M5 chips, said Gurman.

According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/10/no-m5-macbook-pro-2025/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, Apple is rethinking its original plan to minimally refresh the MacBook Pro lineup with M5 chips later this year.

Apple is said to have two versions of the entry-level 11-inch iPad in development, codenamed J581 and J582.

The current iPad 11 is available in 128, 256, and 512GB capacities.

Based on the report, the next-generation low-end iPad model will look like the current version but include a faster chip, but there is no word yet on which chip it will use. The iPad 11 features an A16 processor.
