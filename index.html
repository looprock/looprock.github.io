            iFixit today <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYLLtDxT_sM">shared a video</a> with teardowns of the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Apple Watch Series 9, providing a closer look inside the watches.

<br/>
Notably, the video confirms that the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is equipped with a 564 mAh battery, as <em>MacRumors</em> was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-battery-capacities/">first to report last week</a> via a regulatory database. This is around a 4% larger capacity than the 542 mAh battery in the original Apple Watch Ultra, but Apple says both models have the same battery life of up to 36 hours.
<br/>
<br/>
The video also confirms that the 41mm Series 9's battery capacity is 282 mAh, which is unchanged from the 41mm Series 8.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            These two conceptions, these forms in the use of offensive and defensive, appear so frequently in theory and reality, that the imagination is involuntarily disposed to look upon them as intrinsic forms, necessary to attack and defence, which, however, is not really the case, as the smallest reflection will show. We take the earliest opportunity of examining them, that we may obtain once for all clear ideas respecting them, and that, in proceeding with our consideration of the relations of attack and defence, we may be able to set these conceptions aside altogether, and not have our attention for ever distracted by the appearance of advantage and the reverse which they cast upon things. We treat them here as pure abstractions, extract the conception of them like an essence, and reserve our remarks on the part which it has in actual things for a future time.<br>

            <p>Formatting text is a common task in <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/programming">C++ programming</a>, whether you're building command-line applications, working with files, or displaying information to users. There are several methods for formatting text in C++, each with its own set of pros and cons. In this article, we'll explore these methods, provide code examples, and discuss the advantages and drawbacks of each approach.</p>

<h2 id="method1cstreams">Method 1: C++ Streams</h2>
<p>C++ streams, including <code>cout</code> and <code>ostringstream</code>, offer a straightforward way to format text. You can use stream manipulators to control various aspects of formatting, such as precision and width. Here's a simple example:</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            This article traces the history of SAND, the native token of the Sandbox platform, which began as a mobile game by Pixowl in 2012. After Animoca Brands' acquisition of Pixowl, SAND transitioned into a blockchain-based virtual world. It outlines the fundraising efforts, including the issuance of SAND tokens and Simple Agreements for Future Equity (SAFEs), which raised $2.5 million to develop the Sandbox. SAND was minted on the Ethereum blockchain in July 2019 and later offered through private sales and an IEO on Binance.com in 2020. The article discusses SAND's availability on Binance.US as of 2022 and how it is perceived as an investment due to the Sandbox's growth prospects.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            How had it happened? who had killed the convicts? Was it Ayrton? No, for a moment before he was dreading their return.

But Ayrton was now in a profound stupor, from which it was no longer possible to rouse him. After uttering those few words he had again become unconscious, and had fallen back motionless on the bed.

The colonists, a prey to a thousand confused thoughts, under the influence of violent excitement, waited all night, without leaving Ayrton’s house, or returning to the spot where lay the bodies of the convicts. It was very probable that Ayrton would not be able to throw any light on the circumstances under which the bodies had been found, since he himself was not aware that he was in the corral. But at any rate he would be in a position to give an account of what had taken place before this terrible execution. The next day Ayrton awoke from his torpor, and his companions cordially manifested all the joy they felt, on seeing him again, almost safe and sound, after a hundred and four days separati [...]<br>

Protocol Labs consistently marketed FIL as an investment, emphasizing long-term value. It also introduced mechanisms like burning to reduce supply. Protocol Labs has continued to develop the Filecoin ecosystem, attracting investors and promising future growth.<br>

            James Whitcomb Riley and Edgar Wilson Nye (Bill Nye) were to
          give readings in Tremont Temple, Boston, November, 1888.  Mr.
          Clemens was induced to introduce Messrs. Riley and Nye.  His
          appearance on the platform was a surprise to the audience, and
          when they recognized him there was a tremendous demonstration.

I am very glad indeed to introduce these young people to you, and at the same time get acquainted with them myself. I have seen them more than once for a moment, but have not had the privilege of knowing them personally as intimately as I wanted to. I saw them first, a great many years ago, when Mr. Barnum had them, and they were just fresh from Siam. The ligature was their best hold then, the literature became their best hold later, when one of them committed an indiscretion, and they had to cut the old bond to accommodate the sheriff.

In that old former time this one was Chang, that one was Eng. The sympathy existing between the two was most extraordinary; it wa [...]<br>

            The “Dolphin” was rapidly equipped, her rigging was ready, and there was nothing to do but fit her up. She carried three schooner-masts, an almost useless luxury; in fact, the “Dolphin” did not rely on the wind to escape the Federalists, but rather on her powerful engines.

Towards the end of December a trial of the steamer was made in the gulf of the Clyde. Which was the most satisfied, builder or captain, it is impossible to say. The new steamer shot along wonderfully, and the patent log showed a speed of seventeen miles an hour, a speed which as yet no English, French, or American boat had ever obtained. The “Dolphin” would certainly have gained by several lengths in a sailing match with the fastest opponent.<br>

            ADA, the native token of the Cardano blockchain, was initially sold during a token sale that raised millions. Founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano has three key entities responsible for its development, including IOHK, which designs, builds, and maintains the Cardano blockchain. Proceeds from ADA sales have funded Cardano's growth and development. ADA has become a widely traded cryptocurrency, and its investors expect profits based on Cardano's continued development efforts and market adoption.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            I do not claim that I can tell a story as it ought to be told. I only claim to know how a story ought to be told, for I have been almost daily in the company of the most expert story-tellers for many years.

There are several kinds of stories, but only one difficult kind—the humorous. I will talk mainly about that one. The humorous story is American, the comic story is English, the witty story is French. The humorous story depends for its effect upon the manner of the telling; the comic story and the witty story upon the matter.

The humorous story may be spun out to great length, and may wander around as much as it pleases, and arrive nowhere in particular; but the comic and witty stories must be brief and end with a point. The humorous story bubbles gently along, the others burst.

The humorous story is strictly a work of art—high and delicate art—and only an artist can tell it; but no art is necessary in telling the comic and the witty story; anybody can do it. The art of telling a humorous story—understan [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers are able to individually repair the bottom-right microphone on the lower-end iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, according to information obtained by <em>MacRumors</em> today from multiple sources.
<br/>

<br/>
The new procedure of replacing this microphone on its own should make these repairs cheaper for customers, and also less wasteful, as part of Apple's focus on environmental responsibility. As for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, and other iPhone models, repairing this microphone still requires replacing the entire mid-frame chassis. 
<br/>
<br/>
For repairs of all other microphones on iPhones, including next to the earpiece and rear camera, a mid-frame replacement is still required.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup</div> [...]<br>

Moving violations may produce a little extra revenue for the city or state, but it doesn&#8217;t do much for the officers performing the stops. Pretextual stops?
