            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today stopped signing iOS 18.0, preventing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users who have upgraded to iOS 18.0.1 from downgrading to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>.

<br/>
It is not unusual for Apple to stop signing older versions of iOS within a week or two after a new version of iOS is released. When Apple stops signing an update, it can no longer be installed on an ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå due to a server-side software verification check that happens before new software is installed, so those who have upgraded to the latest version of ‚ÄåiOS 18‚Äå cannot downgrade to iOS 18.0.

The 17-minute movie is set in World War II, and it follows a group of sailors that are struggling to survive a deadly torpedo attack.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Submerged was directed by Austrian filmmaker Edward Berger, who also directed 2022 movie All Quiet on the Western Front. Apple shared a behind the scenes video on the making of Submerged, showing off the full-scale 23-ton submarine set that was used for filming.

<br/>
Submerged, like other Apple Immersive Video content, features high-resolution 3D video that's meant to be viewed on the Vision Pro, and it is meant to make the wearer feel like they are part of the action. Spatial Audio is included for a more immersive experience.
