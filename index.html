            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is reportedly developing a version of visionOS – its operating system for Apple Vision Pro – that will work with smart glasses, as part of continuing efforts to expand its AR product lineup beyond a cumbersome headset with something that has wider appeal.

<br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman, the Vision Pro has so far been a flop. Many users find the $3,500 headset too heavy for extended use, expensive, and prone to overheating, relegating it to niche status.

<br/>
Previously, the multi-account ability was only available for beta testers on Android, but now TestFlight app users on iOS have access to the feature, which should make it possible to manage more than one personal or business account on the same device. Notably, the feature will eliminate the need for users to use the WhatsApp Business app to access a separate account.

Based on WhatsApp beta 25.2.10.70, users will be able to either set up the device as a primary account or by scanning a QR code to link the new account to an existing one as a "companion [...]<br>

I think this might be more because the project doesn't have enough official ways to recognize people than it is an endorsement of the particular thing that I've done here, the limitations of which I am always careful to mention. In particular, I do not intend this as a comprehensive picture of contributions to the project, or even to development activity; and I lack the data to fairly divide credit for a single commit between multiple individuals. Nevertheless, I am very grateful to all the people who have expressed appreciation for these posts, or told me about the value that they derived from them.
