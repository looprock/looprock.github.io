            Square Enix <a href="https://na.finalfantasy.com/news/2719">today announced</a> that iOS game Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles is shutting down immediately, due to some kind of in-app purchase bug.

Powerbeats Pro 2 feature the same H2 chip from the AirPods Pro 2, enabling Active Noise Cancellation, which is a feature the original Powerbeats Pro lack. Another key feature is heart rate monitoring, with each earbud featuring LED optical sensors that can pulse at over 100 times per second to measure heart rate via blood flow. This feature works with supported fitness apps like the Peloton app and Nike Run Club.

            In a <a href="https://x.com/tim_cook/status/1890068457825394918">social media post</a> today, Apple CEO Tim Cook teased an upcoming "launch" of some kind scheduled for Wednesday, February 19.

Apple says the steps can also be followed if the Apple Watch speaker's audio is "crackling, distorted, muffled, or intermittent."
<br/>
<br/>
The potential solutions listed include updating your Apple Watch to the latest watchOS version, restarting the Apple Watch, un-pairing and re-pairing the Apple Watch to an iPhone, checking whether Silent Mode or Do Not Disturb is turned on, cleaning the Apple Watch's microphone and speaker, and drying the Apple Watch with a microfiber cloth to ensure there is no water in the microphone and speaker areas.

            Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/the-apple-tv-app-is-now-available-on-android/">announced</a> the release of an Apple TV app for Android smartphones and tablets. The app is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.atve.androidtv.appletv">now available on the Google Play store</a>.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-12 12:38:57-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            There aren't too many 5K displays on the market that can compete with Apple's Studio Display, but ASUS recently came out with the ASUS ProArt Display 5K, which is a solid competitor. The ProArt Display 5K features a 27-inch 5K screen with 218 pixels per inch, aka retina quality.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>
<br/>
ASUS sells the ProArt Display 5K for $799, so it's actually half the price of the Studio Display, and much, much cheaper than the Pro Display XDR. The ProArt Display is more generic looking than Apple's monitors, so you're not getting Apple style, but if you're used to looking at a 5K Retina display and you need a second monitor, you can get that same general screen quality at a cheaper price.
<br/>
<br/>
In our testing, the ProArt Display 5K was color accurate, sharp, and very similar to the Studio Display. Make sure to watch our video  [...]<br>

            Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/mac/2024-mac-mini-macbook-pro">added MacBook Pro and Mac mini models with M4 series chips</a> to its certified refurbished store in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Ireland for the first time since the computers were introduced in October 2024.

<br/>
Some refurbished MacBook Pro models with M4 chips are also available in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and select other European countries.
<br/>
<br/>
As usual for refurbished Macs, prices are discounted by approximately 15% compared to the equivalent new models on Apple's online store. Note that Apple's refurbished inventory changes often, and the order button is still grayed out for some configurations in some countries, so keep checking back if you are eyeing a particular model.
