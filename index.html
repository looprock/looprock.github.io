<br/>
Peloton on Thursday said that after listening to member feedback on GymKit, the integration will continue to be offered.

Peloton wanted to stop offering GymKit integration in favor of the Peloton One-Tap tracking feature, but GymKit has been a key feature on the $2,500 Bike+ <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/08/peloton-announces-bike-gymkit-support/">since its 2020 debut</a>, and other Peloton machines since 2022.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            This week we’re joined by Stefano Maffulli, the Executive Director of the Open Source Initiative (OSI). They are responsible for representing the idea and the definition of open source globally. Stefano shares the challenges they face as a US-based non-profit with a global impact. We discuss the work Stefano and the OSI are doing to define Open Source AI, and why we need an accepted and shared definition. Of course we also talk about the potential impact if a poorly defined Open Source AI emerges from all their efforts. Note: Stefano was under the weather for this conversation, but powered through because of how important this topic is.<br>

            Several of Apple's display suppliers have proposed their prices for supplying OLED displays for the fourth-generation iPhone SE, <em><a href="https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=4724">The Elec</a></em> reports.

Samsung Display, BOE, and Tianma are all said to have entered their proposed prices for OLED panels for the iPhone SE 4, which is expected to launch next year. Previous iPhone SE models have all used LCD displays.
<br/>
<br/>
The report's sources said Samsung offered the lowest unit price of $30, BOE offered $35, and Tianma $40. Apple is reportedly haggling for $20, and negotiations are ongoing. Display manufacturers are believed to have been bidding to supply the panels since at least &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/11/suppliers-bidding-on-iphone-se-4-displays [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Microsoft does not plan to bring an Xbox Cloud Gaming app to iOS at this time because there's no opportunity for monetization, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said in an interview with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24073666/microsoft-gaming-phil-spencer-interview-ps5-switch-games">The Verge</a></em>. When asked whether Apple's recent app ecosystem changes in the European Union make "room" for Xbox Cloud Gaming on iOS, Spencer said that monetization was an issue, and that the Digital Markets Act forcing Apple's updates does not "go far enough to open up competition."
