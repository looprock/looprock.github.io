            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> Pro models that are coming next year will feature a major camera lens overhaul, according to <em><a href="https://money.udn.com/money/story/5612/7540381">Economic Daily News</a></em>. Apple plans to use more advanced glass molded lenses, which the site says will lead to a thinner and lighter design, lenses that are shorter, and improved optical zoom magnification.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>

The information comes from the ongoing antitrust lawsuit that Google is facing from the U.S. Department of Justice, and it was shared by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/30/23938775/google-search-app-ios-built-in-antitrust"><em>The Verge</em></a>.

<br/>
Pichai proposed the idea to Cook after Cook said that he wanted Apple to be "deep, deep partners" with Google. He told Cook that pre-installing the Google Search app would drive more traffic to Google, and therefore more money to Apple.

            WhatsApp is planning to add passkey support to its iPhone app, according to code discovered <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1718985018322653224">by software researcher @aaronp613</a> in the latest beta version of the app.

<br/>
Passkey support would allow iPhone users to sign in to WhatsApp with Face ID, Touch ID, or the device's passcode. Passkeys are stored in iCloud Keychain. To use passkeys on the iPhone, the device must be updated to iOS 16 or later.
<br/>
<br/>
"Passkeys are more secure than passwords, because they're uniquely generated for every account by your own device, and are less vulnerable to phishing," <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/guide/iphone/iphf538ea8d0/ios">says</a> Apple.
