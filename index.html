            With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, Apple is introducing new features for the Maps app. The changes in the Maps app aren't as notable as some of the additions we've seen with prior software updates, but there is at least one long-awaited function.

<p id="f3vh0L">On Wednesday, Reddit was acting up again. Some of us at <em>The Verge</em> ran into some issues browsing the site, including threads with blank comments and some pages with a “504 Gateway Timeout” message.</p>
<p id="ol34ib">The key issue seemed to be that comments weren’t loading when you were browsing Reddit’s website when not logged in. In an Incognito Chrome window on desktop, I could see that people posted comments but couldn’t actually see what they wrote. At the bottom of the screen, Reddit’s website showed messages that said, “We had a server error...” I saw this issue when logged out on Reddit’s mobile website as well.</p>
