iOS 19 will introduce a "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/21/apple-llm-siri-2026/">more conversational Siri</a>" powered by "more advanced large language models," according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.

            This year, Apple tweaked iPhone 16 Pro screen sizes to make them bigger than 2023's iPhone 15 Pro models, and next year we are also expecting a change in the size of the displays in the iPhone 17 lineup. Here's what we know.

<br/>
Apple could introduce a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/22/iphone-17-lineup-specs-detail-upgrades/">new display size</a> for the standard iPhone 17 model in 2025. The iPhone 17 could measure in at 6.3 inches, up from 6.1 inches, which would make it the same size as the current iPhone 16 Pro. At 6.3 inches, it would be in between the size of the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 and the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus. However, next year there may be only one non-Pro model in Apple's lineup (see below).
