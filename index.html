            <b>Published:</b> 2025-07-11 11:32:30-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In the early to mid-1990s, Apple released a wide range of quirky and unique products, ranging from printers and digital cameras to a video game console and a PDA with a keyboard. Steve Jobs nixed the vast majority of these products upon his return to Apple in 1997, helping the company to regain its focus and avoid impending bankruptcy.

<br/>
Many longtime <em>MacRumors</em> readers are likely already well informed about Apple's peculiar 1990s era, but for those who started following the company in the 2000s, it can be fascinating to look back at the products released in the older days.
<br/>

Below, we reflect on five unique Apple products from the 1990s, including the QuickTake, Newton eMate 300, Studio Display, StyleWriter, and Pippin. There are of course many others, ranging from the Twentieth Anniversa [...]<br>

            Apple updated its vintage and obsolete <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102772">products list</a> to add several Macs, iPads, accessories, and more. The 2013 "Trash Can" <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> was added to the vintage list, 12 years after it was first introduced.

<br/>
Most products are added to the vintage list much earlier, but Apple sold the 2013 ‌Mac Pro‌ for so long that it wasn't eligible until now. A device is considered "vintage" five years after it was last distributed for sale.

The trash can ‌Mac Pro‌ wasn't discontinued until December 2019, when the redesigned "Cheese Grater" ‌Mac Pro‌ came out. The 2013 ‌Mac Pro‌ was the subject of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phil-schiller/">Phil Schiller</a>'s infamous "Can' [...]<br>
