            Stephen Miller just&#160;called&#160;a federal judge’s enforcement of constitutional law “legal insurrection.” Let that sink in. A Deputy White House Chief of Staff—one of the most powerful people in the executive branch—declared that judicial review of presidential power is rebellion against the United States government. A Trump-appointed judge carefully reviewed the facts, applied the relevant statutes, [&#8230;]<br>

<br/>
Both apps now feature Liquid Glass interface elements, such as more rounded buttons, floating navigation bars, and translucency in some areas. They also feature Liquid Glass app icons that look like multiple layers of glass stacked on one another.

<br/>
TestFlight got an icon overhaul, and the new design features simplified propellers that work better with the Liquid Glass look.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-06 11:56:27-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the second beta of iOS 26.1, Apple updated the design of alarms set on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, making them harder to dismiss than before. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1022258" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/ios-26-1-slide-to-stop.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
Stopping an alarm in iOS 26.1 beta 2 requires a new Slide to Stop gesture rather than a simple tap. You can continue to tap to snooze an alarm, but if you want to turn it off entirely, you need to use a swipe.
<br/>
<br/>
Transitioning from a tap to a slide gesture to stop an alarm could potentially help people who sleepily dismiss an alarm without meaning to. It's easy to accidentally tap Stop instead of Snooze in the current version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, but now if you blindly tap at your ‌iPhone‌ in the morning, you won't be able to disable your alarm entirely.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-06 11:28:56-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the second beta of iPadOS 26.1, Apple tweaked multitasking on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> to reintroduce the Slide Over feature. Slide Over was removed in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a> because Apple replaced it with a new windowed multitasking system, but some ‌iPad‌ users missed the feature.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006553" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/ipados-26-design.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
The updated version of Slide Over works with all of the new ‌iPadOS 26‌ multitasking features. You can have multiple app windows open, and then use Slide Over to quickly get to an app that overlays your windowed apps.
<br/>
<br/>
To use Slide Over in iPadOS 26.1, you'll need to tap on the green icon of an app's window to open up the window sizing controls. From there, you can tap on the "Enter Slide Over" button.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-06 07:26:48-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Spam calls have become such a nuisance that many people simply don't answer their phone unless they recognize the number. In iOS 26, though, you can learn about who's calling before you respond, thanks to a clever new feature that intercepts unknown calls and asks the caller to identify themselves before your iPhone even rings.

<br/>
The new "Ask Reason for Calling" feature is kind of like having your own receptionist. When someone who isn't in your Contacts calls, your iPhone automatically answers the call with a polite automated message asking for their name and reason for calling. The caller is placed on hold while their response is transcribed to text and displayed on your screen, letting you decide whether to accept, decline, or ask for more information.

Updated Apple backend code found by <em>MacRumors</em> includes a reference to a "Dual Knit Band," which is not a band that exists at the current time.
