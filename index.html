Screen Time provides parents with settings to remotely manage a child's device, allowing them to restrict device usage to certain times, set time limits for apps, and block inappropriate content. However, some parents have complained that Screen Time settings sometimes reset or fail to sync across all devices within a Family Sharing group.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-07-30 21:49:34+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Containerization in its entirety is an incredibly useful concept. From being able to execute applications in isolation, to being able to port them easily with all of their dependencies and configuration is all a developer could ask for.

After getting somewhat familiar with this concept, I decided to get my hands on it. So, let me walk you through the whole process of containerizing a frontend Nextjs application using Docker.

Note that this is an absolute beginner approach. I am not advising to use it in production. This is something new to me and I am still exploring Docker. If you’re reading this, maybe you can help me make some improvements to this approach.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Russia-Ukraine conflict has revealed the critical role of information warfare, fought primarily on social media, with Russia using propaganda and disinformation while Ukrainian volunteer groups and advertising agencies counter it through digital marketing campaigns. Remarkable achievements, such as Banda's inspiring ads and Bitmedia's cryptocurrency-driven influence, have turned the tide in Ukraine's favor on the digital battlefield. Despite limited resources, these efforts have reached millions, leading to decreased public support for the war in Russia. Beyond virtual campaigns, Bitmedia has also provided aid to Ukrainian soldiers and orphans. This conflict showcases how ordinary citizens and companies can leverage social media to challenge government propaganda and highlights the potential for post-war transformation through rebuilding efforts and cryptocurrency adoption.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Starting a game development project can be daunting after finalizing the initial game design. Whether it's a simple game jam idea or a detailed 10-page design document, the challenge lies in building the game itself. When faced with unfamiliar tasks, game developers often enter "Chaos Goblin Mode," where the focus is on the user experience rather than perfection. Tricks and techniques are employed to create the illusion of complex features without getting bogged down in technicalities. The key principles of Chaos Goblin Mode include prioritizing user experience, reusing existing code and assets, and adopting prebuilt systems when suitable. Copying successful mechanics from other games and seeking feedback from peers are also essential in the Chaos Goblin approach. While this approach may not lead to a polished masterpiece, it allows developers to quickly build functional prototypes and progress in their projects.<br>

            Sequencers can address the scalability and performance limitations of the Ethereum network. They alleviate the burden on the Ethereum main chain by sorting and batch processing on-chain transactions, thus shifting most of the computational and data storage work to Layer 2. The decentralized sequencers’ capability ceiling depends on the underlying protocol and the network environment. While decentralized sequencers can improve the security and resilience of a system, there are still limitations and challenges.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>There’s a saying in sports: the best team doesn’t always win. It usually is preceded by an all-time great regular season that has just crashed down to earth in the playoffs or a young upstart shocking everyone with an unexpected performance.</p>

There are a lot of things that translate between the sports and business worlds. Competition is competition. But the more I think about this idea, the less I believe it.</p>

In my experience, the best teams <strong><em>do</em></strong> always win in business.</p>
