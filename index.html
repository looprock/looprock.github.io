            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Samsung recently launched the Galaxy S25 Edge, a super thin smartphone that will compete with Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>. To see what it's like using such a thin phone, <em>MacRumors</em> video editor Dan Barbera used it as his main device for two weeks to see what it might be like to use Apple's equivalent later this year.

<br/>
The Galaxy S25 Edge has a 6.7-inch display, so it's a larger smartphone, but because it's so thin and light, it's easy to hold. It's just 5.8mm thick and it weighs 163 grams, and it's so light that it almost feels like a plastic dummy phone. Apple's ‌iPhone 17 Air‌ could be even thinner at 5.5mm, and it will have a similar display size at 6.6 inches, so it should be a lot like the S25 Edge.

The latest word comes from Apple analyst Jeff Pu. In a research note with equity research firm GF Securities this week, Pu said that he expects the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and so-called iPhone 18 Fold to be equipped with Apple's A20 chip, and he believes the chip will have some key design changes over the A18 and upcoming A19 chips.
<br/>
<br/>
First, Pu reiterated that the A20 chip will be manufactured with TSMC's 2nm process. The current A18 Pro chip in iPhone 16 Pro models is fabricated with TSMC's second-generation 3nm process, while the A19 Pro chip for the iPhone 17 Pro models is expected to use TSMC's third-generation 3nm process.

            All Apple Watch models include a stock Calculator app that offers a couple of handy features for working out how much you should tip when eating out and how much each person in a group owes if you're splitting the bill.

<br/>
The two functions can be used together, but if it's just yourself dining out then you can just leave the People field set to 1. The steps below show you how it works.  
<br/>
<br/>
Note: If you see a standard percentage (%) button where the TIP button should be, you can change the calculator layout to replace it. Simply go to <strong>Settings ➝ Calculator</strong> and select <strong>Tip Function</strong> instead of <strong>Percent</strong>.

Sources tell the publication that Apple's offer would likely exceed what NBC has proposed for the same package, particularly if focused on Sunday night games.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WhatsApp has ended support for iOS versions older than iOS 15.1, removing the chat platform's compatibility with several iPhone models in the process. The change began on June 1, after Meta delayed it from an original planned date of May 5.

<br/>
WhatsApp is no longer compatible with iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus models. Users with those devices won't be able to access the encrypted chat service through the app unless they upgrade their iPhone. Alternatively, users can visit web.whatsapp.com in their browser, but the experience won't be the same.

Users who intend to upgrade can back up their WhatsApp chats to iCloud, and restore their full chat and media history to a newer, supported device using using WhatsApp's Chat Transfer feature. Instructions on how to do so are outlined in WhatsApp's &lt;a href="https://f [...]<br>

            YouTube has updated its iOS app to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/youtube/id544007664?platform=iphone">version 20.22.1</a>, which now requires iOS 16 or later to install and run. The change means several older iPhone models are no longer officially compatible with the app.

<br/>
The affected devices are those that cannot upgrade beyond iOS 15 – namely, the iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and the first-generation iPhone SE. If you have an iPod touch 7, that will no longer run the app either.

<br/>
ProMotion has been limited to the Pro models since it debuted on the iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max in 2021, but several sources have suggested that Apple will this year fit the 120Hz variable refresh technology into the base iPhone 17 model, as well as the new iPhone 17 Air that replaces the Plus model in the lineup.
<br/>
<br/>
However, Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/5821279480/PuPiSAB0t">Fixed Focus Digital</a>'s sources apparently tell them that the panel being used in the upcoming non-Pro models is "just a standard 120Hz screen, not ProMotion with adaptive refresh rate." If the claim is true, it  [...]<br>

We're starting with the next-generation version of macOS, which Apple is apparently going <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/01/macos-tahoe-name-leaked/">to call macOS Tahoe</a>.

            It has been three weeks as of today since Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/apple-releases-ios-18-5/">released iOS 18.5</a>, and we are still waiting for the first iOS 18.6 beta to follow.

<br/>
Below, we outline everything we know about iOS 18.6 so far.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Timing</h2>
<br/>
Apple's software engineers have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/31/apple-begins-testing-ios-18-6/">internally testing iOS 18.6 since late March</a>, according to the <em>MacRumors</em> visitors logs.
<br/>
<br/>
The first betas of iOS 13.6 through iOS 16.6 were all released before WWDC over the years, while the first iOS 17.6 beta was released the week after WWDC last year, so it is hard to pinpoint exactly when the first iOS 18.6 beta will be available.
