            <b>Published:</b> 2024-11-26 03:41:54-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Brazil's antitrust regulator has ordered Apple to remove App Store restrictions on third-party payment systems and allow developers to market alternative payment options for in-app purchases. Apple has 20 days to comply or face daily fines of $43,000.

<br/>
The ruling by the Council for Economic Defense (Cade) comes in response to a 2022 complaint filed by MercadoLibre, Latin America's largest e-commerce platform. The company accused Apple of abusing its monopolistic position by requiring developers to use Apple's own payment system and preventing them from redirecting users to external payment options.
<br/>
<br/>
Under the new requirements, Apple must permit app developers to implement tools allowing customers to make purchases outside the Apple ecosystem. This includes enabling the use of hyperlinks to external website [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is experiencing challenges as it attempts to launch Apple Intelligence in China, with regulators cautioning that foreign companies face a "difficult and long process" for approval unless they partner with local firms, according to a new <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8ce6715a-0614-4c8b-9bc2-5f4174519f9f">Financial Times</a></em> report.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Rich Communication Services (RCS) is a messaging standard Apple adopted in iOS 18 that is significantly enhancing the messaging experience between iPhone and Android devices. Think of it as SMS 2.0 – a major upgrade to the traditional text messaging we've been using for years.
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>Key Features of RCS</h2>
<br/>
Apple's decision to embrace RCS came <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">last year</a> after persistent persuasion from Google, which has been championing RCS adoption worldwide – and with good reason. Compared to MMS and SMS, the standards that Apple uses for text messages, RCS offers the following advantages:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>Higher quality photos and videos</li>
<br/>
<li>Larger file sizes for attachments</li>
<br/>
<li>Audio messages</li>

            Introduction: Welcome to Episode 6 of the Fearless Concurrency in Rust series! In this episode, we explore the powerful concept of ARC (Atomic Reference Counting) and its critical role in managing shared resources in multithreaded Rust programs. By leveraging ARC, developers can safely share ownership of data across threads without relying on a traditional garbage collector, enabling efficient, flexible, and scalable concurrency.
What is ARC?: Understanding Atomic Reference Counting as a lightweight, manual garbage collection system.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If we plot the metrics associated with large DDoS attacks observed in the last 10 years, does it show a straight, steady increase in an exponential curve that keeps becoming steeper, or is it closer to a linear growth? Our analysis found the growth is not linear but rather is exponential, with the slope varying depending on the metric (rps, pps or bps).<br>
