            Apple plans to mostly stop announcing new features more than a few months before they are ready to launch, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-18/how-apple-intelligence-and-siri-ai-went-so-wrong"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman and Drake Bennett</a>.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-05-18 14:31:37-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is planning to give users in the EU the ability to set a default voice assistant other than Siri, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-18/how-apple-intelligence-and-siri-ai-went-so-wrong"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman and Drake Bennett</a>.

<br/>
In a lengthy report about Apple's artificial intelligence shortcomings today, Gurman and Bennett said Apple plans to introduce this change across multiple software platforms, which likely means the iPhone, iPad, and Mac at a minimum.
<br/>
<br/>
Presumably, this means that users in the EU will be able to set options like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant as their default voice assistant on Apple devices.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Amazon is hosting a big collection of discounts across multiple Apple products this weekend, including notable deals on AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, Apple Pencil Pro, and MacBook Air.

<br/>
<br/>
Amazon has the USB-C AirPods Max for $479.99 in Starlight, down from $549.00. This is a solid second-best price on the headphones, and it's been a few months since we last tracked an all-time low price, so if you've been waiting for a deal this is a good time to buy.
<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, the AirPods Pro 2 are on sale on Amazon for $188.56, which is another second-best price.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The upcoming all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air could become the first Apple smartphone to adopt advanced battery technology, with Japanese supplier TDK preparing to ship its new generation of silicon-anode batteries by the end of June.

According to <em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250516VL201/tdk-iphone-silicon-production-component.html">DigiTimes</a></em>, TDK CEO Noboru Saito revealed in a recent interview that the Apple supplier has accelerated its production timeline, moving shipments forward from the originally planned September quarter.

In the year following the device's launch, user feedback suggests that it has failed to meet expectations for comfort, software support, and social acceptance. In interviews conducted by <em>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/">Wall Street Journal</a></em>, early buyers of the Vision Pro reported that the device now sits largely unused due to a range of practical issues.

The good news is that the company has brought back the foldable design that was absent from its predecessor, the WH-1000XM5.

<br/>
In the video, Microsoft says the top-end Windows PCs with Copilot+ branding are up to 58% faster than the previous-generation MacBook Air with the M3 chip, based on Cinebench 2024 multi-core CPU benchmark results. The ad is citing old figures that were reported on all the way back <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/20/microsoft-surface-pro-faster-macbook-air/">in May 2024</a>, so take that as you will.

While the ad is using an older MacBook Air for comparison purposes, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/windows/copilotplus-claims?tabs=amd">Microsoft's fine print</a> does say some Copilot+ PCs are still faster than even the latest MacBook Air models with the M4 chip, based on the same Cinebench 20 [...]<br>
