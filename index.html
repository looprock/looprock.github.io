            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-16 13:12:45+02:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>The new Use Model shortcut in Apple Shortcuts opens up a lot of possibilities. For example, I like to summarize a lot of pages. Sometimes, ChatGPT can’t get the text for those pages, or I don’t trust the text it retrieves. There’s a shortcut that will retrieve the cleaned up text of a page (as markdown). So, you can get that markdown, and with the new Use Model shortcut, you can summarize it and then send the markdown summary to Drafts. You could open the text up in another app to view, whatever you like, but as you can imagine, I like to catalog this stuff. Also, it can generate a little link to include for my newsletters link list.</p>
<p>You put this in your Sharesheet, and now when you’re reading the World Wide Web, you can get summaries real quick-like.</p>

The third-generation AirPods Pro Charging Case is equipped with a U2 chip – a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip that enables Precision Finding. This feature helps you locate the case using the Find My app at longer distances, in the unfortunate event that you lose or misplace your AirPods Pro 3 somewhere around you. The AirPods Pro 3 Charging Case comes with a built-in speaker, so you can also make it play a sound using ‌Find My‌ to more easily locate it.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Apple Watch Ultra 3 replaces the second-generation model that was introduced two years ago in Apple's smartwatch lineup, but how different are the two successive smartwatch generations?
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The two Apple Watch Ultra models share the overwhelming majority of their features, so should you consider buying or sticking with the second generation to save money? This breakdown serves as a way to see all the differences that the Ultra 3 brings to the table.
<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Series 11 represents <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-10-vs-series-11/">one of the smallest upgrades</a> to the mainstream model ever, while the Apple Watch Ultra 3 provides a bit bigger but still modest change compared to its predecessor.
