Apple does not publicly advertise mAh battery capacities for iPhones. In his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-WhZT02ubg">iPhone 16e review video</a> today, however, Dave Lee of the YouTube channel Dave2D said the device is equipped with a 3,961 mAh battery. That is more than a 10% increase in battery capacity compared to the regular iPhone 16 model's 3,561 mAh battery, provided that the iPhone 16e's battery voltage remains the typical 3.85V.

Clicking on the three dots next to a search result will provide an interface that lets you request its removal. There are three options to choose from, including "It shows my personal info," "I have a legal removal request," and "It's outdated and I want to request a refresh."
<br/>
<br/>
The first option allows users to request the removal of information like phone number, email address, home address, credit card numbers, login credentials, and more, and if selected, Google will review the request and possibly remove the result.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iOS 18.4, Apple made a small tweak to Safari that could be polarizing because it puts your search history front and center. When you open up a new Safari tab and then tap into the search field, Safari shows your recent search history.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991973" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/ios-18-4-safari-search.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
In iOS 18.3.1, opening up a new tab and then tapping into search does not show your history, and the view remains on the personalized Safari home page. iOS 18.3.1 has no clear view of prior searches at all, except that a recent search will show up in your suggested results if you search for the same thing again.

We are still waiting on C1 modem speed tests, but it is expected that Apple's first modem will provide slower 5G speeds compared to Qualcomm's Snapdragon X71 modem in iPhone 16 models.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-26 02:40:19-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In macOS, a Text Clipping is a selection of text that you've dragged from an application to another location on your Mac, where it becomes a unique kind of standalone file. 
<br/>
<br/>
The relatively little-known feature has been around since at least Mac OS 9, and it offers a convenient way to save out pieces of text from pretty much anywhere for later use in another app or document.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991857" height="2880" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/macos-text-clippings-hidden-feature.jpg" width="5120"/>
<br/>
To create a Text Clipping, simply highlight any piece of text, then hold left-click and drag it with your mouse to your Desktop or an open Finder window. 
<br/>
<br/>
This saves the highlighted text – including any rich text formatting – as a <strong>.textclipping</strong> file named after the first few words of text that you selected, but you can easily rename it to make it more identifiable.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Multiple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owners today noticed a pronunciation processing issue that causes the word "Trump" to momentarily show up when using dictation to send a message with the word "racist."

<br/>
In some cases, when speaking the word racist through the ‌iPhone‌'s built-in dictation feature, the ‌iPhone‌ briefly interprets the spoken word as "Trump" and "Trump" text shows up in the Messages app before being corrected to the actual word (racist) as Apple's processing interprets what was said.
<br/>
<br/>
Speaking the word racist with dictation doesn't always show "Trump" first, though it did show up more often than other words in our testing. We also saw "Rhett" and "Rouch" appear before the ‌iPhone‌ corrects to racist.
