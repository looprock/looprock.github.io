            <b>Published:</b> 2025-07-21 07:45:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple recently announced that iPhone users will soon be able to watch videos right on the CarPlay screen in supported vehicles.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005143" height="1102" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/CarPlay-Liquid-Glass-Dark.jpg" width="1960"/>
<br/>
This is arguably the biggest new CarPlay feature coming with the iOS 26 update later this year, and yet Apple did not even mention it during its WWDC 2025 keynote last month. Instead, it was buried <a href="https://developer.apple.com/carplay/">on Apple's developer website</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
iPhone users will be able to wirelessly stream videos to the CarPlay screen using AirPlay, according to Apple. For safety reasons, video playback will only be available when the vehicle is parked, to prevent distracted driving. The connected iPhone will be able to detect when the vehicle is in motion and end playback.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple will soon begin development of iOS 27 with a shift in emphasis as the company prepares its flagship software to accommodate the first foldable iPhone, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.

<br/>
Apple could potentially end up having to drop a key supplier of iPhone OLED panels, following a preliminary ruling issued by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) that found Chinese display maker BOE violated federal trade secret laws.

<br/>
The ITC found that BOE and seven of its subsidiaries misappropriated Samsung Display's trade secrets to manufacture panels, violating Section 337 of the Tariff Act. The commission has proposed banning BOE's OLED imports and ordering existing U.S. inventories be removed from sale.

            Apple's next-generation iPad Pro models will be equipped with two front-facing cameras, according <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-20/apple-s-2026-foldable-iphone-samsung-comparison-m5-ipad-pro-dual-front-cameras">to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

<br/>
In his <em>Power On</em> newsletter today, Gurman said the upcoming iPad Pro models with the M5 chip will have both portrait and landscape cameras, letting you capture photos and go on video calls without having to worry about the device's orientation.
<br/>
<br/>
The current iPad Pro models with the M4 chip have a single front camera that is designed to be used in landscape orientation.
<br/>
<br/>
Face ID already works in any orientation on the iPad Pro.
