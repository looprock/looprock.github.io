            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has dealt a blow against spyware maker NSO Group and the Israeli firm's efforts to move Apple's lawsuit against it to its home country. Apple in November 2021 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/23/apple-sues-nso-group/">sued the group</a> and its parent company with the aim of holding it accountable for targeting Apple users with spyware used for surveillance purposes.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            X, formerly Twitter, now supports passkeys as a login option for iOS users in the United States, the company has <a href="https://x.com/Safety/status/1749881895641633080?s=20">announced</a>.

<br/>
Passkeys are both easier to use and more secure than passwords because they let users sign in to apps and sites the same way they unlock their devices: With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>, or a device passcode. Passkeys are also resistant to online attacks like phishing, making them more secure than things like SMS one-time codes.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple integrated passkeys into iOS in 2022 with the launch of iOS 16, and it is also available in iPadOS 16.1 and later as well as macOS Ventura and later.

            Apple has been quietly making a series of artificial intelligence related acquisitions and staff hires in a bid to bring on-device AI to its next-generation iPhones, claims a new report by the <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/52839eb2-6641-42a6-acd7-5d41e809c97a">Financial Times</a></em>.

According to the report, indications suggest Apple has been focusing on "tackling the technological problem of running AI through mobile devices."

<br/>
Apple's AirPods firmware updates often do not come with details on new features, so it is unclear what might be included in the software. For last week's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 3</a> update with this firmware version, Apple listed only "bug fixes and other improvements."

<br/>
After abandoning the driverless plans, Apple aimed for a car with Level 4 autonomous functionality that would have allowed the car's system to take over driving in limited circumstances such as on highways, but even that was too ambitious. Apple is said to be focusing on driver-assistance features that are closer to how Tesla vehicles oper [...]<br>

The original Macintosh popularized the computer mouse, allowing users to control an on-screen pointer.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has until March 6 to fully comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act, which among other things will require the company to allow iPhone users to install apps outside of the App Store. With the deadline for this regulation fast approaching, it is likely that Apple will begin preparing for these changes with iOS 17.4.

The first iOS 17.4 beta is expected to be released as early as this week, although it is unclear if the app-related changes will be rolled out for testing immediately, or held for later beta versions.

The efforts are part of the company's wider push to offer more health capabilities, embodied by the recent announcement of the Galaxy Ring, which touts activity and sleep tracking, with more health features set to arrive later. In a new interview, Samsung's mobile digital health chief Hon Pak said:<blockquote>If we can do continuous blood pressure and glucose, we're in a whole different ballgame.
