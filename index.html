            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-24 10:38:21-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Repair site iFixit today did one of its <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/114046/m5-macbook-pro-teardown">device teardowns on Apple's new M5 MacBook Pro model</a>, which Apple released on Wednesday.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Unsurprisingly, there are few changes to the device because the only new features are a new M5 chip and a faster SSD, but iFixit did find some subtle tweaks related to repairability.
<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a>'s casing is still secured with P5 screws, and battery replacement is more difficult than it needs to be because Apple only sells the battery as part of the main chassis that also includes the keyboard. Getting to the fan, ports, and other components inside the ‌MacBook Pro‌ requires removing the logic board, and iFixit says that essentially every component in the ‌MacBook Pro‌ has to come out to perform a battery replacement following Apple's official repair steps.

"Apple plans to add support in upcoming iPhones as early as next year for 5G networks that aren't tethered to Earth's surface, which includes satellites," the report said. "That would give the iPhone full internet access over satellite," it added.

Microsoft's Copilot Fall Release introduces <a href="https://youtu.be/mOjGOLHG6AY">Mico</a> – an animated orb that serves as the voice mode's visual companion.

That said, Microsoft's attempt to soften its AI offering could backfire if users tap Mico repeatedly – the action briefly turns Mico into Clippy (officially named Clippit), the animated paperclip assistant that first appeared in Office 97 and became a fixture o [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-23 16:07:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Anthropic today said it is updating the Claude chatbot with a new memory feature, which will put Claude on par with ChatGPT. With memory enabled, Claude will be able to recall past conversations.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Anthropic first added memory to Claude earlier this year, but with the initial implementation, Claude would only recall details when specifically asked. In August, Anthropic expanded the memory feature to allow Claude to automatically remember conversation details without a specific user request, and that functionality has been limited to Team and Enterprise subscribers.
<br/>
<br/>
Claude's memory functionality is now expanding to all paid users, so Pro and Max subscribers can use the feature. Max users can turn it on now, while Pro subscribers will get access "over the coming days."
<br/>
<br/>
Memory is an opt-in feature that can be turned on in Claude's settings. There are options for "search and reference chats" and "generate memory from chat history."  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is one of several tech companies that will contribute to the construction of U.S. President Donald Trump's 90,000-square-foot ballroom, reports <em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/ballroom-donors-white-house-trump">CNN</a></em>.

<br/>
Construction began on the ballroom this week, and the White House's east wing was torn down. Trump claims that the ballroom will cost $350 million, and that it will be privately funded through donations. The cost has already increased $150 million over the figures that Trump previously quoted.
<br/>
<br/>
Other tech companies that have donated to the ballroom construction include Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and HP.

There is no word on the specific amount that Apple donated toward the project.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-23 15:35:40-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Earlier this month, IKEA debuted a tiny NFC-enabled bed that's meant to help smartphone users cut down on nighttime usage. The small "Phone Sleep Collection" is modeled after an actual IKEA bed, and it uses the IKEA app to monitor scroll-free sleep time.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Users who hit seven hours of scroll-free time for a week straight are eligible for an IKEA voucher.
<br/>
<blockquote>Every phone bed comes with built-in NFC tech, making sleep effortlessly rewarding. Here's how it works:
<br/>
- Download the IKEA UAE app.
<br/>
- (For iOS users) When prompted, allow Motion &amp; Fitness tracking.
<br/>
- Place your phone on its bed and tap the notification to open the app.
<br/>
- That's it. Your sleep time will track in the background (no counter will appear).
<br/>
- Complete seven nights of seven-hour sleep, and earn your voucher.</blockquote>

The standard iPhone 18 will be equipped with the A20 chip, while the iPhone 18 Pro models and Apple's long-rumored foldable iPhone will be equipped with an A20 Pro chip, the post said. However, the post did not mention which chip the entry-level iPhone 18e or second-generation iPhone Air [...]<br>

            Apple returned to court this week to argue that a federal judge exceeded their authority when they held the company in contempt and barred it from collecting any commission on external in-app transactions, <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-21/apple-s-fight-with-epic-over-opening-app-store-returns-to-court">Bloomberg</a></em> reports.

<br/>
Apple told the appeals court that a U.S. District Judge went further than their 2021 order allowed when they banned Apple from taking any commission on purchases made outside apps. Apple said the order only required it to allow links to outside payments, not to stop collecting fees entirely.

Apple argued that if the judge disagreed with its approach, they should have clarified the order instead of punishing the company for contempt. It told the  [...]<br>
