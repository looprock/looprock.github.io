"Depending on the amount of free space available, iOS might dynamically reserve update space for Automatic Updates to download and install successfully," says Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26-release-notes">release notes</a> for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/apple-ios-26-developer-beta/">first iOS 26 developer beta</a>.

This change will ensure that iPhone users who have Automatic Updates turned on in the Settings app actually have enough storage space available for those updates to download and install.

Starting with Apple's latest software releases, such as iOS 26 and tvOS 26, you will be able to sign in to a supported app on one Apple device and automatically be signed in to the app on other Apple devices.

            iPadOS 26 allows iPads to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/the-ipad-just-got-a-lot-more-like-a-mac/">function much more like Macs</a>, with a new app windowing system, a swipe-down menu bar at the top of the screen, and more. However, Apple has stopped short of allowing iPads to run macOS, and it has now explained why.

<br/>
In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M7w9it-Pf8">interview</a> this week with Swiss tech journalist Rafael Zeier, Apple's software engineering chief Craig Federighi said that iPadOS 26's new Mac-like features strike a good balance between productivity and simplicity. He added that macOS is not optimized for touch-screens, although rumors suggest that might change one day.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today added the iPhone XS to the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102772">vintage products list</a> on its website.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Apple considers a device to be "vintage" once five years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale. Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers may still offer repairs for vintage devices, subject to parts availability.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple released the iPhone XS in September 2018, and it was discontinued a year later. However, the device remained available through select resellers for longer, so it has only recently reached the five-year mark for vintage status.
<br/>
<br/>
In two more years from now, the iPhone XS will be classified as fully obsolete, at which point Apple will no longer service the device.

            If you <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/get-ios-26-developer-beta-iphone/">installed iOS 26 Beta or iPadOS 26 Beta</a> through Apple's Developer Program or Software Beta Program, you may decide you want to downgrade because of usability or stability issues.

Apple's beta versions of its major software updates can be notoriously buggy, especially the early releases. You may find apps not working properly, poor battery life, device crashes, and features that don't do what they're supposed to.

            Valve has quietly released a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545611272206420782">Steam Client Beta</a> that runs natively on Apple Silicon, finally ending its reliance on the Rosetta 2 translation layer.

<br/>
The updated Steam client eliminates the performance overhead that plagued Mac gamers since Apple's transition to its own chips. Steam's Chromium-based interface, which could slow to a crawl on occasion, now runs directly on Apple Silicon rather than through Intel emulation.
<br/>
<br/>
Early testers report dramatically faster launch times and smoother navigation through the Store and Library. The difference should be immediately apparent, with basic actions like switching tabs feeling fluid rather than laggy.
