<br/>
There are three varieties, including 100 LEDs on an 8-meter cord, 250 LEDs on a 20-meter cord, and 500 LEDs on a 40-meter cord. There are three new lighting effects designed for the Festavia lights in the Hue app, including Prism, Glisten, and Opal. The effects can also be used with the first-generation Festavia lights, and the Prism effect can be used on all Hue color lights.
<br/>
<br/>
A new MR16 Philips Hue bulb adds smart lighting to conventional spotlights. It works on the same 12V voltage as standard MR16 bulbs, so the bulb should fit into most existing fixtures.

            One measure of a successful network is uptime - providing consistent, reliable service for members and customers. If there are frequent connection errors or downtime notifications, it becomes difficult to deliver an experience where people can connect and interact with ease. When faced with uptime challenges, being able to quickly escalate issues to network engineers helps ensure that people can work the way that they want to.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>\
Module Design Pattern is a way to encapsulate and organize code in a self-containing module that can expose certain functionalities while keeping the rest of the code private.</p>
<p>\
This helps prevent variable and function name clashes, improves code maintainability, and promotes the concept of separation of concerns.</p>
<p>\
Here's an example of how you can implement the Module Design Pattern in JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code>// Module using the Module Design Pattern
var Module = (function() {
  // Private variable
  var privateVariable = "I am a private variable";

  // Private function
  var privateFunction = function privateFunction() {
    console.log("This is a private function");
  }

  // Public function
  var publicFunction = function() {
      console.log("This is a public function");
  }
  // Public interface
  return {
    publicFunction:publicFunction,
    // Public variable accessing private variable
    publicVariable: privateVariable
