            While the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-announces-new-airpods-max/">AirPods Max were updated this week</a>, some fans of Apple's over-ear headphones have expressed disappointment about the lack of major changes.

<br/>
There are only two changes with the updated AirPods Max: a USB-C charging port instead of Lightning, and new color options, including Blue, Orange, Purple, Midnight, and Starlight. The headphones did not receive Apple's H2 chip that debuted in the AirPods Pro 2 a few years ago, meaning that they will continue to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-airpods/">miss out on Adaptive Audio features</a>, and there are no improvements to active noise cancellation either.

            The European Union's Court of Justice today <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2024-09/cp240133en.pdf">said</a> it has confirmed the European Commission's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/08/30/apple-repay-14-5-billion-back-taxes-ec-rules/">2016 decision</a> that Ireland had given illegal tax benefits worth €13 billion to Apple from 1991 to 2014. This is a final ruling, so Ireland is now required to recover these funds, which were placed into an escrow account by Apple around six years ago.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Though pre-launch Apple Watch rumors suggested that Apple would update its entire Apple Watch lineup this year, Apple ended up focusing primarily on the Apple Watch Series 10. We didn't get a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> or a new Apple Watch Ultra 3, with Apple only adding a new color option for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>.

            With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple is adding a new option that will let you pause a video in the middle of a recording, providing an option for capturing multiple shots in a single video rather than having to start and stop new videos each time.

<br/>
Last year, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max was updated with a 5x Telephoto lens that used Tetraprism technology, but the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ was limited to 3x zoom.
