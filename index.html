            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-07 01:18:33-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, currently in beta, creating a new task for Apple's Reminders app is now a much faster process, thanks to the introduction of a "New Reminder" control that lets you create tasks without ever opening the app. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010930" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/ios-26-reminders-app-control-center.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
Whether you assign it to Control Center, your Lock Screen, or the Action button (on iPhone 15 Pro models and newer), this simple addition should make it a lot easier to record your reminders.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How the New Reminder Control Works</h2>
<br/>
When you activate the New Reminder control, the Reminders app isn't actually opened. Instead, iOS 26 displays a compact popup panel that includes everything you need to create a task: you can select the Reminders List, add a note, the date, location, and a flag.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            One of the more frustrating parts of the RFK Jr. experience is nailing down his views. Part of that is because he tends to keep quite vague about those views, especially when it comes to vaccines, depending on who he is talking to. When he&#8217;s running an anti-vaxxer organization, his views are specific and clear. [&#8230;]<br>

            Sonos plans to raise prices for some of its products later this year because of tariff costs, the company said in its third fiscal quarter earnings presentation [<a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/672173472/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/FINAL-3Q25-Earnings-Slides-POST-CALL-pptx.pdf">PDF</a>].

<br/>
Sonos manufactures its devices in Vietnam and Malaysia, and the countries are facing tariffs of 20 percent and 19 percent, respectively. In the third fiscal quarter, tariffs cost Sonos $2.1 million, and the company estimated that costs would increase to $5 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2025. Sonos said that the estimate for 4Q 2025 reflects the prior 10 percent tariff rate on in-transit inventory that will arrive during the quarter, and future quarters "may differ."
