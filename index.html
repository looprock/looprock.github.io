            <b>Published:</b> 2024-04-26 08:00:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple introduced the third-generation AirPods nearly three years ago and an all new model is now slated to launch later this year with a range of improvements and new features.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-905655" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/AirPods-Fourth-Generation-Feature-Red.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Many of the changes and improvements introduced with the third-generation AirPods originated on the first-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>. As such, it seems likely that many of the upgrades coming to the fourth-generation AirPods will be shaped by the second-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌. Our best indications so far about what to expect come from a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/17/airpods-4-new-design/">report by <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

            Most <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users know how to share a webpage link in Messages, but not everyone realizes that you can quote text from the webpage and include it in the message link. Keep reading to learn more.

<br/>
Incorporating quoted text when sharing a webpage link in Messages is a great way to get to the point and make it clear why the content you're sharing is relevant and interesting. It not only makes the link more engaging but also personalizes the message if it's sent in the midst of a conversation.

By highlighting specific text, you can streamline your communication by directing the recipient's attention to the most pertinent information on the linked website. It saves time, and ensures that the key piece of information you want to share isn't misse [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-04-26 06:34:06-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple used to regularly increase the base memory of its Macs up until 2011, the same year Tim Cook was appointed CEO, charts posted on Mastodon by David Schaub show.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898568" height="1454" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-feature-purple-green.jpg" width="2585"/>
<br/>
Earlier this year, Schaub generated two charts: One showing the <a href="https://mstdn.social/@dschaub/111813281624281698">base memory capacities of Apple's all-in-one Macs</a> from 1984 onwards, and a second depicting Apple's <a href="https://mstdn.social/@dschaub/111382154184733138">consumer laptop base RAM</a> from 1999 onwards. Both charts were recently resurfaced by the <a href="https://atp.fm/560">Accidental Tech Podcast</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
The graphs show that Apple tended to increase the base memory every two years or so, but that this trend ended when Cook took over the company from Steve Jobs. Memory increased quickly until the Mac Plus  [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-04-25 03:40:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Most of us stare at our iPhones for far too long, and this constant exposure to a bright screen can strain our eyes, especially in low-light conditions or during the twilight hours. That's where the ability to dim your iPhone screen beyond the standard brightness settings becomes a game-changer. 
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If the screen of your iPhone or iPad is too bright for comfort, the usual solution is to go to Settings ➝ Display &amp; Brightness and drag the Brightness slider to the left, or open Control Center and adjust the corresponding setting from there. However, if the lowest setting offered by the Brightness level just isn't dim enough for you, there's another way to make your screen even darker. 
<br/>
<br/>
This feature is particularly useful if you find yourself needing to use your device in dark environments, such as in a bedroom where a pa [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Threads is testing an option that allows users to archive old posts so that they don't appear on their profile, according to Instagram head Adam Mosseri. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-902359" height="607" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/instagram-threads-app.jpg" width="1079"/>
<br/>
In a <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/C6Jq-r-xVpM">post</a> on the Meta-owned social media platform, Mosseri said that the archive option being tested with a small number of people included a manual setting for individual posts, as well as the ability  to automatically archive all posts after a certain period of time. 
<br/>
<br/>
Users also have the option to unarchive a post to make it public again. If beta testing goes well, the ability to archive posts is likely to be rolled out globally as an option rather than a default behavior, which Mosseri said was the overwhelming preference based on user feedback.

Passkeys serve as a replacement for a traditional password, and because device authentication is required, passkeys put a stop to online attacks like phishing. With a passkey, there's no password to steal, and no one-time SMS or authentication code that can be intercepted.
