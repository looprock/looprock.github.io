            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            TSMC has officially mentioned its work on 1.4nm fabrication technology that is likely destined to underpin future Apple silicon chips.

<br/>
In a slide (via <em>SemiAnalysis</em>'s <a href="https://x.com/dylan522p/status/1734766944774193291?s=20">Dylan Patel</a>) from its Future of Logic panel, TSMC disclosed the official name of its 1.4nm node for the first time, "A14." The company's 1.4nm technology is expected to follow its "N2" 2nm chips.
<br/>
<br/>
N2 is scheduled for mass production in late 2025, to be followed by an enhanced "N2P" node in late 2026. As a result, it is unlikely that any A14 chips will arrive before 2027.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple was the first company to utilize TSMC's 3nm technology with the A17 Pro chip in the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, and the company is likely to follow suit with the chipmaker [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-12-14 05:53:54-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple in iOS 17 added inline predictive text for iPhones, but did not include a way to turn it off independently of predictive suggestions above the keyboard. In the latest iOS 17.2 update, that's changed. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926577" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/inline-predictive-text.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
Apple has improved its machine learning technology on iPhones in an effort to make iOS a lot more helpful, and one of the features in which this tech has been deployed is inline predictive text. 
<br/>
<br/>
Predictive text does just what it says - it predicts what you're going to type next, and offers to autocomplete it. As you type, the predicted text appears ahead of the cursor. If it has accurately predicted what you intend to type, all you need to do is tap the spacebar and iOS fills it in for you.

            In iOS 17.2, Apple lets you customize the alert tone used by your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> for default notifications. This is good news for anyone who does not like the "Rebound" tone that Apple introduced in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>.

<br/>
In previous versions of iOS, Apple allowed users to choose a ring tone and a text tone, as well as custom alert sounds for email, calendar, and reminder alerts. Anything else that threw up notifications used a default sound, and there was no way to change it.

With ‌iOS 17‌, Apple then changed the original default alert sound, from "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYHdfDJrwMU">Tri-tone</a>" to "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjveF8Vtw6c">Rebound</a>." Many users disliked the ch [...]<br>
