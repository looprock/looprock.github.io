            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26.4, Apple added an Average Bedtime metric to the Sleep section of the Health app, letting users better monitor how bedtime impacts sleep quality.

<br/>
Under a new Sleep Highlight, Apple lists the time that you went to bed and the time that you usually go to bed based on averages over a two-week period.
<br/>
<br/>
In iOS 26.3, Apple displayed average sleep time over the past seven days. That highlight still exists, but it is now supplemented with the daily bedtime readout.

<br/>
Apple also updated the Vitals readout in the U.S., and it once again lists blood oxygen level on the line graph overview that's available each day. In iOS 26.3 and earlier versions of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, there was a section for the blood oxygen level, but the graph did not include a b [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2026-02-17 09:06:30-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's next entry-level <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> is expected to gain the A18 chip, a change that appears modest on paper but would enable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> on the company's most affordable tablet for the first time.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Apple last refreshed the entry-level ‌iPad‌ in March 2025, adding the A16 chip. ‌Apple Intelligence‌ is supported by devices with the A17 Pro or newer, or Apple's M-series chips, due to the processing, memory bandwidth, and neural engine performance required to run on-device and hybrid AI workloads. The A16 in the current entry-level ‌iPad‌ falls just short of this threshold, leaving the product outside Apple's AI rollout despite its relatively recent update.

<br/>
Apple is working on a next-generation version of the iPad mini (codename J510/J511) that features the A19 Pro chip, according to information found in code that Apple mistakenly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/ipad-mini-a19-pro-chip/">shared</a> in August. 
<br/>
<br/>
Apple's A19 Pro chip since debuted in the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro models. The iPhone 17 Pro models include the higher-end version of Apple's A19 Pro chip with a 6-core CPU and a 6-core GPU, while the iPhone Air uses a mid-tier A19 Pro chip with one fewer GPU core tha [...]<br>

            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/">macOS Tahoe</a> 26.4 beta that Apple released today includes a Charge Limit feature for the Mac. There is a new slider bar that lets Mac users select a charge level from 80 percent to 100 percent.

<br/>
The Charge Limit is a setting that's available in addition to Optimized Battery Charging, and it can prevent a Mac from ever charging to 100 percent.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple's existing Optimized Battery Charging feature keeps a Mac from charging to 100 percent until it's needed for use, with the option using your daily charging routine to determine when to charge to full. While Optimized Battery Charging can help preserve battery life, it still regularly allows a Mac to charge to 100 percent.

Apple removed the compact tab bar option with the launch of ‌macOS Tahoe‌ and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a>, but there were Mac and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> users who missed it.

<br/>
In the ‌Apple Music‌ app, there's an option to type in an idea and get automatic song suggestions for a playlist. Apple has some pre-set suggestions that include "morning coffee music," "hip-hop party songs," and "disco songs that defined the 1970s," but you can type in any idea, mood, or feeling.

<br/>
Apple today reminded developers and users that future versions of macOS will not support Intel machines, and Rosetta 2 support for apps will end after macOS 27.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Iteration has long been one of the more fragmented areas of Go, with developers relying on ad hoc patterns to traverse custom data structures. This article explores the range-over-functions experiment, a proposed evolution of the language that introduces a standardized iterator model while preserving Go&rsquo;s familiar for range syntax. Using the new iter package and sequence abstractions, it shows how iteration logic can be expressed more clearly, flexibly, and idiomatically. Originally published in April 2024, the concepts remain highly relevant as Go continues to evolve toward more expressive yet simple language features.</p><br>
