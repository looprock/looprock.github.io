Specifically, we're sharing all of the Apple products that currently have all-time low prices, or discounts that are at least very close to their record-low prices. Now that Black Friday is here, we expect these to be the best prices of the season, so if you've been holding off on purchasing any of the products listed below, now is definitely the time to do so.

            <p>I’ve been wondering why the quality and ease of making stuff with AI has not resulting in a creative explosion. In particular with just a hefty dose of prompt-craft, you can get great D&amp;D stuff.</p>

<p>I’m guessing part of the reason is that <a href="https://x.com/SethBurn/status/1993549909388316845">the incumbent gate-keepers hate AI</a>. They, rightly, see it as a threat to how much they get paid.  I could see that they also find it simply offensive, like someone taking a big shit on their desk.</p>
<p>Pooping aside, the money-loss is supply and demand thing: if it’s difficult to produce creative content, there’s less of it, and when’s there’s demand, and the price goes up. People make money.</p>
<p>As a consumer of D&amp;D content, I benefit from creating my own content. Indeed, creating your own content is a huge page of D&amp;D. I make plenty of “by hand,” but even more “by AI.”</p>

            <p><em>Summarized by AI.</em></p>
<p><strong>Open source software is sustained by overworked, often unpaid volunteers</strong>, many of whom face crushing workloads and relentless community pressure. A recent study by Miranda Heath, supported by Sentry’s Open Source Pledge, reveals that burnout among maintainers is not an isolated issue but a systemic failure threatening the stability of the global software ecosystem. <strong>Critical infrastructure depends on developers who are exhausted, demotivated, and increasingly ready to quit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Burnout manifests in three escalating stages</strong>: first, the loss of motivation, where tasks once manageable feel impossible to begin; then emotional breakdown, with irritability, frustration, and withdrawal from communities; and finally, cognitive detachment, marked by cynicism and alienation from the work. Surveys show that <strong>73% of developers have faced burnout</strong>, and 60% of maintainers have considered leaving open source entirely—a di</p> [...]<br>
