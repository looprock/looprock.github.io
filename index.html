            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Amazon <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-passwordless-sign-in-passkey">today announced</a> that it has added passkey support to its desktop sites and mobile apps, allowing customers to sign in to their accounts without the need for a password.

<br/>
Passkeys are a more secure alternative to passwords because a passkey cannot be shared with another person through a phishing attempt or leaked online through a database hack. Passkeys do not require customers to remember a password or add a two-factor authentication code, but they do require a verified device.
<br/>

Passkeys can be set up in the Amazon settings, and on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac, logging in to an Amazon account can be done with a &lt;a h [...]<br>

            Listen to our Next Level album as a podcast! We grew up in the days of the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Genesis. It’s no surprise that so many of our tracks are inspired by the 8-bit and 16-bit music of our youth. From Castlevania to Contra, Sonic the Hedgehog, and many more — we were inspired by all the nostalgic soundtracks from the games that got us here, to give our pods one-of-a-kind vibes. If you’ve been head nodding to our beats during our shows and you’ve been wishing for a way to listen outside of our pods, then this release will be an absolute delight. It’s dangerous to go alone!

Apple could purchase between 2,000 and 3,000 servers this year, and up to 20,000 next year.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-10-20 13:35:34-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Chinese smartphone company OnePlus this week introduced its first foldable smartphone, the OnePlus Open. OnePlus joins several other manufacturers that have come out with foldable smartphones, including Samsung, Google, and Xiaomi. We picked up the OnePlus Open to see how it compares to Apple's latest flagship, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max.

<br/>
The OnePlus Open is similar to the Galaxy Fold in that it opens up like a book. When folded, the cover screen has a 6.31-inch display that's about in the middle of the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ and Pro Max in terms of size. Unfolded, the display measures in at 7.82 inches, so a bit smaller than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>. The displays are OLED and support a 120Hz refresh rate, with  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is unlikely to release any new Macs or iPads for the remainder of 2023, according to a series of predictions shared in recent weeks by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

<br/>
<h2>Macs</h2>
<br/>
<br/>
Last month, Kuo said Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/">unlikely to release any new MacBooks with the M3 chip</a> this year. All existing MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models are equipped with M2 series chips, so any new models would presumably be equipped with M3 chips, which effectively means that Kuo does not expect any new MacBooks at all for the rest of 2023.
<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this week, Kuo added that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/24-inch-imac-2024-launch/">24-inch iMac would be updated next in 2024</a>, ruling out an up [...]<br>
