            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple increasingly has to compete with other companies for chips made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), as surging demand for artificial intelligence reshapes capacity and customer priority.

<br/>
According to a detailed report published by semiconductor analyst Tim Culpan on his blog <em><a href="https://www.culpium.com/p/exclusiveapple-is-fighting-for-tsmc">Culpium</a></em>, Apple is no longer guaranteed preferential access to leading-edge manufacturing capacity at TSMC, marking a notable change after more than a decade in which Apple's chips were central to the foundry's expansion strategy. Apple is now competing directly with AI-focused customers such as Nvidia and AMD for supply, particularly at the most advanced process nodes.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Development of Apple's rumored OLED MacBook Pro took another forward step this month when the next-generation production line responsible for manufacturing its displays commenced operation.

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984552" height="1265" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/M6-MacBook-Pro-Feature-1.jpg" width="2250"/>
<br/>
Samsung Display is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/oled-macbook-pro-coming-next-year/">expected</a> to make the panels for Apple's MacBook Pro, and has invested heavily in an 8.6-generation OLED production line located at its Asan campus in South Korea. 
<br/>
<br/>
An 8.6G fab uses much larger glass substrates than the OLED lines used for smartphones, which allows multiple laptop-sized panels to be cut from a single sheet. This improves yields and lowers costs, which is just what Apple needs if OLED is to replace mini-LED in the MacBook Pro.

The line is designed around rigid OLED panels with oxide TF [...]<br>

            Apple's foldable iPhone will share the same next-generation A20 Pro chip as the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max models when it debuts this September, according to industry analyst Jeff Pu.

<br/>
In his latest investor note, Pu outlined the projected specifications for all three premium devices that will take center stage this fall, with the regular iPhone 18 and more affordable iPhone 18e models not expected to debut until spring 2027 as part of Apple's new split-launch strategy.

<br/>
Powered by the A20 Pro chip, the iPhone Fold and iPhone 18 Pro models will showcase TSMC's new 2nm process, N2, boasting performance improvements that could be up to 15 percent faster and 30 percent more efficient than A19 chips.

The new campaign created in collaboration with photographer Daniel Sannwald features a massively oversized Ohtani sporting Beats products in various Los Angeles settings.<blockquote>Against iconic LA backdrops, each image amplifies Ohtani's scale—not just physically, but metaphorically. He becomes an elevated figure of pride, strength, and aspiration. Through dramatic scale and surreal energy, the campaign transforms LA into Ohtani's playground—a cityscape where sport and culture intersect.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Ukraine-based developer <a href="https://macpaw.com">MacPaw</a> is set to close Setapp Mobile, its alternative app store for iOS devices in the European Union, next month.

<br/>
The service will officially cease operating on February 16, 2026. Setapp Mobile <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/17/macpaw-launches-setapp-mobile-eu/">launched in open beta</a> in September 2024. 
<br/>
<br/>
In a <a href="https://support.setapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/13690464925212-About-Setapp-Mobile">support page</a>, MacPaw said Setapp Mobile is being closed because of app marketplaces' "still-evolving and complex business terms that don't fit Setapp's current business model," suggesting it was not profitable for the company.

            <p>Check this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlSem-r2n30">out from my pal DaShaun</a>: in May of 2025, 60% of Spring Boot downloads were for versions no longer supported by the open-source project. That’s a lot. Too much, really.</p>
<p>I can see how it happens. You get an app into production, it runs fine, and then you moveon to the next thing. Meanwhile, the version drifts into “End of Life” territory. OSS support ends (like way back in mid-2023 for the Spring version DaShaun mentioned). If you’re running that today without a commercial contract, you are missing over a dozen essential security patches. Or hoping you can handle it yourself…</p>
<p>Better options are:</p>

<p>Upgrade: Move to the supported versions (Spring Boot 3.x or the new 4.x). We have a tool, the Application Advisor, that automates a massive chunk of this migration.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's upcoming iPhone 17e will feature a Dynamic Island instead of a notch at the top of the screen, but unlike the rest of the iPhone 17 lineup, the display itself will still refresh at 60Hz, according to a known Weibo leaker.

<br/>
Apple made major improvements to the iPhone 17's display last year, introducing ProMotion display technology with up to a 120Hz refresh rate, similar to recent iPhone Pro models. 120Hz maximum refresh rates allow for smoother scrolling when viewing webpages and improvements for video, but it looks like the iPhone 17e is not getting the upgrade to keep costs down.
