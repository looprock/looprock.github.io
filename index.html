            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-09 15:04:30-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Before the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Air debuted, rumors suggested that it would adopt the C1 modem chip that Apple first introduced with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a>. It turns out Apple had another idea in mind, and the ‌iPhone‌ Air is equipped with a new C1X chip.

<br/>
Apple says the C1X modem is up to 2x faster than the C1, while using the same cellular technologies. It is apparently faster than the Qualcomm modem in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a>, while using 30 percent less energy. According to Apple, the C1X is the most power-efficient modem in an ‌iPhone‌.

<br/>
Since the Apple Watch was first unveiled in 2014, it has featured what Apple called an "all-day" 18-hour battery life through each successive generation until now.

This significant increase comes despite the Apple Watch Series 11 featuring the same casing and chip as the Series 10, so it is not entirely clear where efficiency savings or changes have been made to obtain a longer battery life.

The Apple Watch Series 11 also supports fast charging, with just 15 minutes providing up to eight hours of battery life. [...]<br>
