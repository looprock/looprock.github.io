            Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5">today announced</a> the launch of Claude Opus 4.5, which it says is the "best model in the world for coding, agents, and computer use." It's improved over prior models for everyday tasks like deep research, and it is a "step forward in what AI systems can do."

<br/>
According to feedback Anthropic received from early testers, Claude Opus 4.5 can complete tasks that were impossible for Sonnet 4.5, and that it is able to handle ambiguity and reason about tradeoffs without hand-holding. The Opus 4.5 model offers better vision, reasoning, mathematics skills, and coding than prior versions of Claude.

            Apple is making progress on the development of the book-style foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> expected in 2026, according to a report from Chinese site <em><a href="https://money.udn.com/money/story/5612/9158381">UDN</a></em>.

Citing supply chain sources, <em>UDN</em> says that Apple has solved "the crease problem" that has plagued most foldable smartphones, and the foldable ‌iPhone‌ will be the first crease-free foldable smartphone on the market. We've heard multiple prior rumors about Apple's intensive work on the hinge and display to minimize creasing, so this isn't the first time the foldable ‌iPhone‌ has been rumored to have a seamless screen.

<p>There is a lot that rings true about this suggestion. Consider the following intuitive, common sense ideas: if we let immigrants come here and work, they’ll take our jobs; we should levy taxes on imports to help protect our economy from foreign competition; crime can only be controlled by getting tough on criminals. These ideas may be true or false, but the point is that they all have populist appeal, and they all seem kind of obvious.</p>

            Apple has published a new ad for the iPhone 17 Pro on its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJObc0V6hJU">YouTube channel</a>, highlighting the device's vapor chamber cooling and A19 Pro chip.

<br/>
Titled "Peak Performance," the minute-long ad opens with a man running through an arid desert landscape when storm clouds coalesce above him. A drop of water falls from the sky and evaporates on his forehead, providing him with super-human performance and multitasking ability. A voiceover says:
<br/>
<blockquote>The Apple A19 Pro chip is vapor cooled. Because when you run cool, you can push your limits. And juggle over 35 trillion complex tasks a second. Just imagine if we were that powerful...</blockquote>As the man continues to run, he plays the keys on an elongated piano while solving a Rubik's cube with one hand, then breaks through a wall and dashes through a room of singers, before smashing through another wall and eclipsing the camera view.

            Earlier this month, the <em>Financial Times</em> reported that Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/15/report-tim-cook-to-step-down-as-soon-as-next-year/">preparing for Tim Cook to step down as CEO of the company "as soon as next year</a>."

<br/>
While the report said that Apple is unlikely to name a new CEO before its next earnings report in late January, it went on to explain that an announcement early in the year would allow for a smooth leadership transition, ahead of Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in June and iPhone event in September.
<br/>
<br/>
However, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said he would be "shocked" if Cook steps down between late January and June next year.
