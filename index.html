            The widely-rumored titanium frame on Apple's upcoming iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will make the devices about 10% lighter than the iPhone 14 Pro models, according to a report today <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-08/apple-event-2023-iphone-15-pro-max-airpods-watch-series-9-products-to-expect">from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.
