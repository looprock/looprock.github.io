We have since learned that Apple's retail store plans in Florida go slightly beyond that. In early December, the company closed its store at The Galleria shopping mall in Fort Lauderdale, and opened a new store across the hall from it. We have confirmed that the new store is a temporary location, meaning that the original store is likely undergoing renovations and will eventually reopen with a modernized design.

            Apple today stopped signing iOS 18.2, which means that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users who have upgraded to iOS 18.2.1 can no longer downgrade to iOS 18.2. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/06/apple-releases-ios-18-2-1/">released iOS 18.2.1</a> earlier in January.

<br/>
When new versions of iOS are released, Apple typically stops signing the prior version after a week or two. An update that is not signed is not able to be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ because there is a server-side software verification check.
<br/>
<br/>
By preventing downgrading to older versions of iOS, Apple ensures that users keep their devices up to date with the newest security improvements.

Apple's iOS 18.2.1 update included unspecified bug fixes, while the now-unsigne [...]<br>

            Any typical search for a consumer Mac monitor inevitably leads to the Apple Studio Display – a seamless but prohibitively expensive option for most users at $1,599. That's where BenQ's MA270U steps in, offering Mac-native features at a much more palatable $459.99.

Unlike typical PC monitors that often feel retrofitted for Mac compatibility, this is a 27-inch 4K display that arrives ready for MacBook use out of the box, complete with built-in color matching, keyboard integration, and even Focus mode support. But can a third-party monitor truly deliver Apple-like integration without the Apple price tag?
