            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In the early to mid-1990s, Apple released a wide range of quirky and unique products, ranging from printers and digital cameras to a video game console and a PDA with a keyboard. Steve Jobs nixed the vast majority of these products upon his return to Apple in 1997, helping the company to regain its focus and avoid impending bankruptcy.

Many longtime <em>MacRumors</em> readers are likely already well informed about Apple's peculiar 1990s era, but for those who started following the company in the 2000s, it can be fascinating to look back at the products released in the older days.

            Apple updated its vintage and obsolete <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102772">products list</a> to add several Macs, iPads, accessories, and more. The 2013 "Trash Can" <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> was added to the vintage list, 12 years after it was first introduced.

<br/>
Most products are added to the vintage list much earlier, but Apple sold the 2013 ‌Mac Pro‌ for so long that it wasn't eligible until now. A device is considered "vintage" five years after it was last distributed for sale.

The trash can ‌Mac Pro‌ wasn't discontinued until December 2019, when the redesigned "Cheese Grater" ‌Mac Pro‌ came out. The 2013 ‌Mac Pro‌ was the subject of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phil-schiller/">Phil Schiller</a>'s infamous "Can' [...]<br>

            Apple plans to release a next-generation Studio Display or equivalent replacement external monitor as soon as early next year, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-10/apple-plans-new-macbook-pro-iphone-17e-and-ipads-by-early-2026"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

<br/>
In his latest report on Apple's product roadmap for 2026, Gurman said the company is planning to launch its first new Mac external monitor since debuting the Apple Studio Display in 2022. 
<br/>
<br/>
The new version, internally code-named J427, "is currently slated for early 2026," alongside Macs with M5 chips, said Gurman.

            Apple in October 2024 overhauled its 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, adding M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips, Thunderbolt 5 ports on higher-end models, display changes, and more.

According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/10/no-m5-macbook-pro-2025/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, Apple is rethinking its original plan to minimally refresh the MacBook Pro lineup with M5 chips later this year.

Apple is said to have two versions of the entry-level 11-inch iPad in development, codenamed J581 and J582.

The current iPad 11 is available in 128, 256, and 512GB capacities.

Based on the report, the next-generation low-end iPad model will look like the current version but include a faster chip, but there is no word yet on which chip it will use. The iPad 11 features an A16 processor.
