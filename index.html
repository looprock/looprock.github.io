            <b>Published:</b> 2024-10-08 08:57:10-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The current Apple TV was released two years ago this month, so you may be wondering when the next model will be released.

<br/>
Below, we recap rumors about a next-generation Apple TV.
<br/>
<br/>
In January 2023, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman reported that a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/">new Apple TV was planned for release in the first half of 2024</a>:<blockquote>Beyond the future smart displays and new speaker, Apple is working on revamping its TV box. A new version with the current design is in the works for the first half of next year with a faster processor, the people said.</blockquote>The first half of 2024 passed by without a new Apple TV, so that rumor has expired.

<br/>
Severance premiered on ‌Apple TV‌+ in February 2022. It was an immediate hit upon its debut, quickly gaining attention for its unique premise and dark tone. The show follows Mark Scout (played by Adam Scott) and his colleagues at Lumon Industries, where employees undergo a procedure called "severance." This process separates their work and personal lives by splitting their memories in two, creating a stark division between their identities inside and outside of work.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Rumors strongly suggest Apple will release the seventh-generation iPad mini in November, nearly three years after the last refresh. Here's a roundup of what we're expecting from the next version of Apple's small form factor tablet, based on the latest rumors and reports.

<br/>
<h2>Design and Display</h2>
<br/>
The new iPad mini is likely to retain its compact 8.3-inch display and overall design introduced with the sixth generation. However, one rumor suggests Apple may address the "jelly scrolling" issue by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/jelly-scrolling-reduced-on-ipad-mini-7/">rotating the screen assembly</a>. This change would be made to minimize the noticeable lag when scrolling vertically in portrait orientation, which is a point of frustration for some users of the current model.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's upcoming entry-level M4 14-inch MacBook Pro may be capable of supporting up to two external displays with the lid open, up from one display supported in the current M3 model, if recent leaks are anything to go by.

<br/>
Apple's existing M3 14-inch MacBook Pro comes with two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, not three Thunderbolt 4 ports like the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models powered by M3 Pro and M3 Max chips.
<br/>
<br/>
Apart from fewer USB-C ports, the lack of Thunderbolt 4 support on the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the base M3 chip means it only supports one display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz (or one display with up to 4K resolution at 120Hz over HDMI) when the lid is open. Currently the only way to support to two external displays simultaneously is with the lid clos [...]<br>

            Repair site iFixit today disassembled the 46mm Apple Watch Series 10, giving us a look at the components inside Apple's thinnest Apple Watch to date.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Apple used an enclosed case for the Series 10, a move that allowed for a the thinner design without impacting the sensor lens assembly. Tolerances in the Apple Watch are super tight, which makes it difficult to get into.
<br/>
<br/>
The Series 10 has a 327 mAh, 1.266 Wh battery inside, with a soft pouch as prior models have had. Though Apple changed the adhesive in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models, that's not the case in the Apple Watch, and it uses traditional adhesive.
<br/>
<br/>
iFixit took a close up look at the OLED display, and there wasn't a noticeable difference between the Series 9 and the Series 10. Apple tweaked the Series 10 display to allow for wider viewing angles, but it's not a feature that can be seen internally.
