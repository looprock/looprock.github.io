            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iMessage will avoid regulation requiring interoperability with other messaging platforms under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), following the conclusion of an investigation by the regulator (via <em><em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-13/apple-imessage-microsoft-bing-dodge-eu-s-big-tech-crackdown">Bloomberg</a></em></em>).

<br/>
The probe concluded that the iMessage platform and Microsoft's Bing do not hold a dominant enough position to be brought under the DMA's strict rules for services provided by big tech's so-called digital "gatekeepers," which include Apple, Meta, Google, Amazon, and TikTok, according to the EU.

Apple and Microsoft said they welcomed the decision to not designate them as core platform services in separate statements following the announcement.
