            Apple's position as the dominant force in the global true wireless stereo (TWS) earbud market is expected to continue through 2025, according to <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/tws-market-entering-maturity-poised-for-moderate-growth-through-2028/">Counterpoint Research</a>.

<br/>
The forecast outlines a 3% year-over-year increase in global TWS unit shipments for 2025, signaling a transition from rapid growth to a more mature phase for the category. While Apple is set to remain the leading brand by revenue and brand recognition, the report suggests that volume growth will be led by lower-priced models under $50 from other brands, driven by emerging markets and replacement demand.

<br/>
The new MacBook will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/new-macbook-with-a18-chip-spotted/">equipped with the A18 Pro chip</a>, according to Kuo. If so, it would be the first Mac to ever use an A-series chip from an iPhone.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            DJI, best known for its line of drones, today announced the launch of <a href="https://store.dji.com/product/dji-power-2000">the Power 2000</a>, a portable power station. DJI already offers the Power 1000, and the Power 2000 is a larger, more capable version of the Power 1000.

<br/>
I was able to test the Power 2000 before launch, to provide insight into the product for those who might be looking for a large power station option.
<br/>
<br/>
DJI's Power 2000 has a 2048Wh capacity with an LFP battery, double the capacity of the Power 1000. It's designed to power multiple devices or large appliances and equipment in emergencies, when off-grid, or when no traditional power source is available such as in a van living situation. It's $1,299, so it's not cheap, but it does seem to be priced competitively.
