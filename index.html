Below, we outline five things to know about the iPhone Air:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/iphone-17-air-features-reported/">As rumored</a>, the iPhone Air only has a single speaker. The earpiece at the top of the device doubles as a speaker, but there is no speaker on the bottom of the device. The holes to the left and right of the USB-C port are for microphones. For stereo audio, use AirPods or a capable external speaker.</li>
<br/>
<li>On the iPhone Air, the Dynamic Island is positioned slightly lower on the screen compared to the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro models. This was likely necessary due to the device's ultra-thin frame necessita</li></ul> [...]<br>

"Real people share how Apple Watch has changed and even helped save their lives—a fitness story in New York, a teen's struggle with mental health in the UK and powerful health and safety stories from the U.S., Japan, and Canada," said Apple.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-13 10:01:46-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The latest iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and iPhone Air models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/iphone-17-n1-chip/">equipped with Apple's all-new N1 chip</a> for Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread connectivity. However, the chip has a Wi-Fi 7 bandwidth limitation.

<br/>
According to FCC documents reviewed by <em>MacRumors</em>, the N1 chip in all of the new iPhone models supports up to 160 MHz channel bandwidth for Wi-Fi 7, short of the standard's 320 MHz maximum. This limitation means the devices cannot achieve the peak theoretical speeds possible with Wi-Fi 7, but real-world performance is typically already bottlenecked by internet service providers and other factors.

For the vast majority of customers, this is a non-issue, but some iPhone users had  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today announced its <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/retail/hornsby/">store at the Westfield Hornsby shopping mall</a>, in Hornsby, Australia, will be permanently closing next month.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Hornsby is a suburb of Sydney, on the Upper North Shore. Apple opened its store there in 2011, and it will close for good on October 4, at 5 p.m. local time.
<br/>
<br/>
In a statement shared with some Australian media outlets a few months ago, Apple said it had decided not to renew its lease at Westfield Hornsby. Apple said all affected retail employees would be given the opportunity to work at Apple's nearby store <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/retail/chatswoodchase/">at the Chatswood Chase shopping mall</a>, in Chatswood, which is set to reopen in October.

Liquid Glass has been contentious during the beta testing period. Some people don't feel like there's enough translucency, and others think Apple has gone too far, impacting readability. Where do you fall on the spectrum? Let us know in the comments below.

            iOS 26 adds a new Hearing Protection setting for AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods Pro 3 in some countries across Europe and the Middle East, such as Belgium, Czechia, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Türkiye, and the United Arab Emirates.

<br/>
Specifically, there is a new "EN 352 Protection" setting in these countries. When this setting is turned on, Apple's website says the Hearing Protection feature on AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods Pro 3 complies with the European hearing protection standard EN 352, by limiting the maximum volume level of media playback to 82 dBA.
<br/>
<br/>
When a set of AirPods Pro 2 or AirPods Pro 3 are paired to an iPhone, this new setting can be turned on or off in the Settings app, by tapping on your AirPods, selecting Hearing Protection, and adjusting the "EN 352 Protection" toggle switch.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>

<br/>
The standard iPhone 17 does not appear to have the antenna window, while the iPhone Air does not support mmWave 5G, so it is not on that device either.

All of the iPhone 12 through iPhone 15 models are outfitted with this antenna window, made of glass. However, it was not present on any of the iPhone 16 models, which were the first devices to feature the Camera Control button on the bottom-right edge, where the mmWave 5G antenna window was previously located.
