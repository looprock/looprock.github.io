            Today marks the 14th anniversary of Steve Jobs <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2011/10/05/steve-jobs-has-passed-away/">passing away</a>, at the age of 56. He died just one day after Apple unveiled the iPhone 4S and Siri.

<br/>
Apple CEO Tim Cook has once again paid tribute to Jobs.
<br/>
<br/>
"Steve saw the future as a bright and boundless place, lit the path forward, and inspired us to follow," said Cook, in a <a href="https://x.com/tim_cook/status/1974822379663589796">post</a> today. "We miss you, my friend."
<br/>
<br/>
Cook also reflected on Jobs while opening Apple's first-ever event at Steve Jobs Theater in 2017.
<br/>
<br/>
"There is not a day that goes by that we don't think about him," he said then.

            The next iPad Pro models are rumored to feature two key upgrades, including Apple's M5 chip, and an increased minimum of 12GB of RAM.

Last week, apparent unboxing videos for the next-generation 13-inch iPad Pro were uploaded to YouTube <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/30/ipad-pro-with-m5-chip-unboxing-video-leak/">by Russian channels Wylsacom</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZLDJQMl7A">Romancev768</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
The same YouTube channels <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/alleged-m4-macbook-pro-unboxing-video/">leaked the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 chip</a> before it was announced by Apple last year, so these latest leaks are likely legitimate.

The unboxing videos showed the M5 chip, and an increased minimum of 12GB of RAM.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is working on a next-generation version of the Vision Pro with an updated chip, and it could include a new Dual Knit Band that provides a more comfortable fit.

Updated Apple backend code found by <em>MacRumors</em> includes a reference to a "Dual Knit Band," which is not a band that exists at the current time. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> comes with a Solo Knit Band and a Dual Loop Band, but no Dual Knit Band.
<br/>
<br/>
Based on the name, the new band could be a cross between Apple's two existing bands, featuring the same comfortable material as the Solo Knit Band but with a more supportive two-band fit. A text description of the Dual Knit Band suggests that there will be an upper band that spans the top of the head and another band that fits behind th [...]<br>

Apple just debuted the ‌AirPods Pro 3‌, adding new features like improved active noise cancellation, the U2 chip, and heart rate monitoring. The AirPods Pro 2 were already more advanced than the ‌AirPods Max‌, which have not been meaningfully refreshed since their introduction in 2020, so the ‌AirPods Pro 3‌ take an even bigger leap ahead of their over-ear siblings. Nevertheless, there is still a good case for buying the ‌AirPods Max‌ against the AirPods Pro.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The MacBook Air is Apple's most popular laptop – a thin, fanless machine that wields quiet power thanks to the efficiency of Apple silicon. While the M4 model isn't exactly old, attention is already turning to its successor.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1009086" height="1408" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/macbook-air-prime-day-2025.jpeg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Apple doesn't telegraph new product launches ahead of time, but we can draw a surprisingly clear picture of what to expect by looking at Apple's silicon roadmap, release cycles, and past upgrades.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Release Timing and Price</h2>
<br/>
Apple appears to have settled into a spring refresh cycle for the MacBook Air. After releasing the M2 model in mid-2022 with an all-new design, Apple skipped 2023 and then delivered back-to-back M3 and M4 MacBook Air updates in March 2024 and March 2025, respectively.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, Apple Maps has a feature called Visited Places that when enabled automatically logs where you've been, with the aim of making it easier to revisit your favorite spots or to share locations with friends.

While it can be useful for tracking your travels, you might prefer to keep your location history private. Here's how to disable the feature and clear your history.

<h2>What Is Visited Places?</h2>
<br/>
Visited Places keeps a record of locations you've visited, organizing them by category such as restaurants, shops, or transit stops. The feature is end-to-end encrypted, so Apple can't read your data, and it syncs across all your Apple devices signed into the same account.
