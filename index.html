The addition of a "Following" tab brings Threads more in line with its rival Twitter, and it will make the app more useful for keeping track of the latest posts in real time. The new tab is still in the process of rolling out as a server-side change, so it is not yet visible to all users, but updating the app and tapping the home button in the bottom menu might help.

In reading the history of nations, we find that, like individuals, they have their whims and their peculiarities; their seasons of excitement and recklessness, when they care not what they do. We find that whole communities suddenly fix their minds upon one object, and go mad in its pursuit; that millions of people become simultaneously impressed with one delusion, and run after it, till their attention is caught by some new folly more captivating than the first. We see one nation suddenly seized, from its highest to its lowest members, with a fierce desire of military glory; another as suddenly becoming crazed upon a religious scruple, and neither of them recovering its senses until it has shed rivers of blood and sowed a harvest of groans and tears, to be reaped by its posterity.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Developers might initially resist No-Code platforms due to pride and preconceptions, but these platforms offer speed, resilience, and maintenance ease, which can provide benefits. End-to-end ownership, a key tenet of developers' work, can coexist with these platforms. Overcoming preconceived notions about No-Code being 'lesser' development is crucial. These platforms can be seen as an additional tool in the developer's arsenal, serving as allies for rapid prototyping, automating tasks, or supplementing custom-coded projects. A balanced approach towards these tools could unlock a world of potential, making developers more effective and versatile.<br>

To start the show Miller shares how Remoti is a total talent platform that connects companies with talent in Latin America, and advocates that the platform offers three main services: talent connection, talent employment, and people products. People products include retention plans, smooth onboarding and offboarding processes, and the upcoming launch of their recruitment app.

He also shares the origin story of Remoti, explaining that the initial basis of the company was established in the UK seven years ago when Miller noticed the demand for salespeople in London’s fintech companies and started a small recruitment firm.<br>

            Apple has become the target of a £785 million ($1 billion) class action lawsuit on behalf of over 1,500 developers in the UK over its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> fees, reports <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/24/apple-targeted-in-app-store-antitrust-damages-suit-thats-seeking-1bn-for-uk-developers/">TechCrunch</a></em>.

The suit accuses Apple of abusing a dominant position by charging a 15% to 30% fee on in-app sales in the ‌App Store‌, a policy that has been criticized by antitrust regulators in other countries.

It also argues UK consumers are missing out because developers are being deprived of money that could be spent on research and development to help drive app innovation.
