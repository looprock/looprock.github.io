            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            All iPhone 17 models in Apple's upcoming flagship iPhone 17 series will use Samsung's high performance "M14" OLED display panel, according to the Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/PeRLSBHBy">Instant Digital</a>.

<br/>
Samsung's "M" series of OLED panels are made for flagship smartphones, while "14" refers to the number of high-performance materials used to produce them. The "M14" panel was used in last year's Apple's iPhone 16 Pro models, and delivers a 30% increase in brightness along with improved longevity compared to the previous M13 panel, thanks to improvements in the efficiency of the blue-emitting layer.
<br/>
<br/>
Oddly, Samsung's latest Galaxy S25 Ultra uses an improved version of the older M13 panel, so it looks like the regular iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air could well have an objective [...]<br>

The new AI model is said to have more than ten times the computing power of its predecessor and outperforms leading competitors, including OpenAI's GPT-4o and Google's Gemini.

The latest iteration of xAI's flagship model introduces new "reasoning" capabilities through two distinct modes: "Think," which displays the AI's reasoning process while resolving requests, and "Big Brain" for handling more computationally intensive tasks.

Alongside the model update, xAI announced Deep Search, which the company describes as a "next generation search engine." The new feature is designed to analyze information from the internet and X (Twitter) to provide comp [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-18 04:17:33-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has stopped signing iOS 18.3, preventing iPhone owners who have upgraded to iOS 18.3.1 from downgrading to that version of iOS. Apple released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/10/apple-releases-ios-18-3-1-with-bug-fixes/">iOS 18.3.1</a> a week ago, two weeks after the company released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/apple-releases-ios-18-3/">iOS 18.3</a>.

<br/>
Apple often stops signing an older version of iOS, usually within a week or two after a new version is released. When an update is no longer signed, it can't be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side software verification check.

This policy encourages users to keep their operating systems up to date. By preventing customers from downgrading to older versions of iOS, Apple ensures that devices [...]<br>

Front Page Tech's 3D artist Asher on Tuesday <a href="https://x.com/asherdipps/status/1891775506632098212">shared</a> this image of the alleged design of the iPhone 17 Pro, offering perhaps the most polished example yet of Apple's next-generation premium smartphone, should it turn out to be accurate. The image is based on increasingly consistent reports that Apple is adopting an oblong camera bump right across the top of the rear shell, similar to the Google Pixel 9 Pro.

            Apple is set to "significantly change" the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s design language later this year, according to a Weibo leaker.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-990003" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-17-Roundup-Feature-2.jpg" width="2500"/>

In a new post, the user known "<a href="https://weibo.com/u/6048569942">Digital Chat Station</a>" said that the ‌iPhone‌'s design is "starting to change significantly" this year. The "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>" reportedly features a "horizontal, bar-shaped" design on the rear, likely referring to an elongated camera bump. On the other hand, the Pro models purportedly adopt a "large horizontal matrix design."

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In macOS, the Hot Corners feature turns each of the four corners of your screen into a designated action, allowing you to quickly access certain functions built into the system, such as Mission Control, Notification Center, the Screen Saver, QuickNote, and more. Many Mac users would agree, there's something satisfying about bringing up these commonly used functions with a simple, swift cursor movement. 
<br/>

<br/>
What isn't so satisfying, however, is accidentally triggering a Hot Corner, which can lead to all kinds of unintended desktop behavior - like application windows flying all over the place. This can happen when you lose track of the mouse cursor, or when you're working within the confines of a smaller MacBook screen. Thankfully, there's a way to tame wayward Hot Corners using modifier keys. Here's how.

Gurman's latest claim flips the previously expected order of devices to transition from M4 to M5 chips, which was based on last year's M4 product launch order. Apple first introduced its M4 chip in an updated iPad Pro in May 2024, followed by the MacBook Pro in October, but it sounds like Apple will deviate from that timeline this time around.

<br/>
<br/>
Below, we recap the latest rumors.

<h2>Pro Display XDR 2</h2>

            Apple is "exploring" the idea of showing search ads in the Apple Maps app, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-16/apple-and-meta-are-set-to-battle-over-new-area-humanoid-robots-m77mwid3"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

<br/>
Back in 2022, Gurman said software engineering was "already underway" to display ads in the Apple Maps app, but Apple did not move forward with the idea at the time. Today, he said Apple is "giving this notion more thought" again.
<br/>
<br/>
This time around, he said Apple has yet to start engineering work, so ads in the Apple Maps app might still be a ways away.
<br/>
<br/>
Ads in the Apple Maps app would not be the traditional banner ads that you see on websites, but rather paid search results. For example, a fast food chain could pay Apple to appear near the to [...]<br>
