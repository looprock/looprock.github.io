The Sonos Arc Ultra is a new high-end soundbar that's priced at $999, while the $799 Sub 4 is the newest Sonos subwoofer with improved design and internals.

<br/>
The Arc Ultra offers up to double the bass of its predecessor, thanks to new transducer technology called Sound Motion. Sound Motion cuts down on the size of the transducer while also improving bass, for better sound from smaller devices. There are 14 Sonos-engineered drivers, the Sound Motion woofer, and a cluster of tweeters with waveguides to provide a 9.1.4 spatial audio experience.

There’s a lot to reckon with — including braces and bootcut jeans, in my case — and you get a sense of what kinds of moments you thought were worth preserving. Apparently, a great deal of funny things happened to my friends and me as we loafed around a suburban coffee shop avoiding homework. Looking through those pages, I can find plenty of documentation of life as we waited for our teammates to finish their tennis matches and turned the communal couch at Caribou Coffee into our own private rec room.

And then I went back to sleep. And then my alarm went off, which is about seven, and I hit snooze and went back to sleep. And then my alarm woke me up again, and I thought, “well I'm gonna get up now,” so instead of pressing snooze, I pressed stop. And then I went back to sleep. Then you came upstairs and you woke me up and I got up.</p></blockquote><p>“This whole snooze button saga…it’s…it’s a JOURNEY.”</p><br>
