            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple launched almost 30 new hardware products in 2024. Here's a look back at exactly what we got this year. 
<br/>

<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-787459" height="1176" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-1.00.47-PM.png" width="2160"/>
<br/>
With the exception of Vision Pro, Apple's 2024 hardware releases largely marked a year of steady refinement. It wasn't a year of massive overhauls across the board, but it did feature some key themes. 
<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro, released in February, stands out as Apple's biggest product launch. While its $3,499 price tag keeps it squarely in early-adopter territory, Apple's first spatial computing device provides a hint at where the company expects technology to move over the coming years. Despite both excitement and criticism surrounding its capabilities, it's clear that 2024 was about laying the foundation, with its true impact likely to unfold in the years to come.

            Apple's fourth-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> could see a slight price increase over the current model, according to a new report originating in Asia.

However, the price of the device is likely to exceed 800,000 won in Korea—around $540.
