            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-06 10:05:09-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            A team of robotics researchers at Apple have designed and prototyped a lamp-like robot with lifelike movements, <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/elegnt-expressive-functional-movement">according to a blog post</a> and accompanying video published last month on the Apple Machine Learning Research website. The lamp, which reminds us of the cute Pixar mascot <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0CmJa5Gdk">Luxo Jr.</a>, may hint at Apple's future plans.

<br/>
The video shows the robot interacting with a person in a lifelike manner. For example, the person asks the robot what the weather is like that day, and the robot looks out the window before responding with the forecast. The person says they will probably go for a hike that day, but the robot looks sad when it finds out it is not invited.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-06 06:26:41-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Remember when 16GB felt like an ocean of storage on the original iPhone? Those were simpler times. Apple initially offered the OG device in storage capacities of 4GB and 8GB, but just months after launching, Apple nixed the 4GB model, eventually replacing it with a 16GB option. Fast forward to 2025, and Apple offers 128GB as the base storage tier for most iPhone 16 models. That might sound like a lot by comparison, but it's becoming genuinely problematic for users caught in an increasingly aggressive AI storage squeeze.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When Apple released iOS 18.2, it introduced a major change to the Mail app with its new Categories and priority messages features. Categories automatically sorts your emails into four distinct sections: Primary, Transactions, Updates, and Promotions. The change also adds contact photos and business logos for conversations in your inbox, but if you don't like how they look, it's easy enough to make them go away.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's latest macOS Sequoia 15.3 update appears to have resolved a bug that prevented popular backup utility <a href="https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper</a> from creating bootable backups, according to developer Dave Nanian.
<br/>

<br/>
The fix addresses an issue introduced in macOS 15.2 that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/17/macos-15-2-breaks-superduper-bootable-backups/">caused SuperDuper to fail</a> during the final stages of creating bootable backups due to a "Resource Busy" error when attempting to copy system preboot or recovery files.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple requires third-party apps to use Apple's own replication tools rather than directly copying the operating system. When these tools malfunctioned in macOS 15.2, it directly impacted SuperDuper's ability to create bootable bac [...]<br>

<em><a href="https://www.etnews.com/20250205000198">ET News</a></em> reports that Apple began packaging the M5 chip last month.
