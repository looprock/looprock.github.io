Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213781">says</a> the update fixes an issue that may prevent transferring data directly from another iPhone during the device setup process, so installing it is very important. The update should appear during the setup process, or it can be installed via the Settings app under General → Software Update if you proceeded to set up the device as new and transfer data later.

The extreme bitterness of the substance precluded all doubt; it was certainly the precious extract of quinine, that pre-eminent antifebrile.

            Web3 startups often fail in marketing due to various reasons. They sometimes underestimate the need for marketing, neglecting traditional channels. Lack of a clear value proposition, differentiation, and market research can hinder their success. Founders' personal brands are crucial, and timing matters in the fast-moving Web3 space. Overhyping projects and neglecting long-term vision can lead to reputational damage.

The greatest of all the arts is to write a drama. It is a most difficult thing. It requires the highest talent possible and the rarest gifts. No, there is another talent that ranks with it—for anybody can write a drama—I had four hundred of them—but to get one accepted requires real ability. And I have never had that felicity yet.

But human nature is so constructed, we are so persistent, that when we know that we are born to a thing we do not care what the world thinks about it. We go on exploiting that talent year after year, as [...]<br>

Instagram chief Adam Mosseri confirmed shortly after the app’s July launch that an edit button was <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/Cujq4SpNhHz">on the list of potential features</a>, and now that Paluzzi has discovered some details about it, perhaps the feature will be available more widely sometime soon. </p>

            Google is continuing on with its relentless #GetTheMessage marketing campaign in an attempt to get Apple to adopt the RCS messaging protocol. In its latest ad, Google shows off the "iPager," which Google describes as a device that "uses outdated messaging tech" like Apple uses "when texting with Android."

Google has been pushing Apple to implement support for RCS, but Apple devices continue to support the older SMS protocol. Google claims that Apple is responsible for all the issues that Android and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users have texting one another, including lack of encryption, broken group chats, pixelated pictures and videos, and the green bubbles.
