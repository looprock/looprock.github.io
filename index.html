<br/>
The week's biggest news was Apple's move to halt sales of its flagship Apple Watch models over a patent dispute, while Apple also squeaked in under the wire to tease the first implementation of next-generation CarPlay from a couple of car manufacturers before the end of the year. Other news and rumors this week involved an iOS 17.2.1 bug fix update, rumors about the iPhone 16 and "Apple Watch X," and more, so read on below for all the details!

            <p>We throw around the term “waste” a lot in software. It’s been around since the 2000s, at least since the Poppendieck’s book <em>Lean Software Development</em>. DevOps really took it and ran with it, it was renamed “toil” in SRE, and now the concept is pretty solidly part of how we think of software. I<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaHnNw_aWQk"> talked with Steve Pereira on what “waste” means</a> exactly. We talked about value stream maps as well, another concept that’s so common that we don’t define it much anymore.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/">Apple GPT</a> in your pocket? It could be a reality sooner than you think. Apple AI researchers say they have made a key breakthrough in deploying large language models (LLMs) on iPhones and other Apple devices with limited memory by inventing an innovative flash memory utilization technique.

<h2>LLMs and Memory Constraints</h2>
<br/>
LLM-based chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude are incredibly data and memory-intensive, typically requiring vast amounts of memory to function, which is a challenge for devices like iPhones that have limited memory capacity. To tackle this issue, Apple researchers have developed a novel technique that uses flash memory – the same memory where your apps and photos live – to store the AI model's data.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-12-20 19:17:59-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple Savings account holders are currently receiving push notifications informing them that Goldman Sachs has raised the interest rate on the account to an annual percentage yield (APY) of 4.25% from 4.15%. This is the first increase in the interest rate since the feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/apple-card-savings-account-launching-today/">launched back in April</a>.

<br/>
While the increase is a welcome one for Apple Savings customers and is a fairly competitive rate, there are some other high-yield savings accounts on the market that currently offer even higher rates.

The interest rate hike comes as Apple and Goldman Sachs are working out how to terminate their partnership for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a> and Apple Savings as Goldman Sa [...]<br>
