Since the release of iOS 14.5 in April 2021, Apple has required apps to ask for permission before tracking a user's activity across other apps and websites for personalized advertising, as part of a feature named App Tracking Transparency. If a user selects the "Ask App Not to Track" option, the app is unable to access the device's advertising identifier.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-12-22 04:43:23-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is reportedly testing next-generation ultra-thin flexible glass (UFG) for its book-style foldable iPhone as it works to make the display crease invisible and potentially solve one of the most persistent issues of existing foldable displays. 
<br/>

<br/>
According to Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/Qjg9Cvjl2">Digital Chat Station</a>, Apple is evaluating UFG panels with uneven thickness, using thinner glass in the folding area to improve flexibility while retaining thicker sections elsewhere for rigidity and durability. 
<br/>
<br/>
Unlike existing foldables, which rely on ultra-thin glass (UTG) that inevitably deforms along the hinge, UFG is designed to distribute bending stress more evenly across the panel. In theory, this approach could reduce the crease to the point where it becomes visually imper [...]<br>

The claim suggests small-scale manufacturing runs will start once factories return to normal operations following the Lunar New Year shutdown, which typically ends in late February.

The Chinese leaker claims that production lines for the iPhone 18 Pro models have already been set up, indicating that the Pro hardware design has already been locked in. The leaker adds that the scope of external design changes is expected to be smaller than some may be anticipating.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-12-19 13:30:30-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's Beats brand is launching a new celebrity ad campaign today featuring rapper Travis Scott and entitled "DARE TO DREAM." The campaign is inspired by a 2011 tweet from Scott when he was just starting his career, in which he claimed, "One day Travis Scott will be somebody."
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The campaign short film is a "testament to how belief in oneself can manifest into reality" and features a re-creation of his actual childhood bedroom and an appearance by his real mother, Wanda Webster.
<br/>
<br/>
The film depicts a young Scott working on music projects using his <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> and the original Beats Studio headphones, with the scene transforming from his bedroom to a dream of sold-out shows on his just-completed "Circus Maximus" tour spanning multiple legs over the past two years.

In February, Apple introduced the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a>, positioned as a replacement for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> SE as a lower-cost model, starting at $599.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Starting with tvOS 26.2, Apple TVs began displaying a user profile selection screen every time you wake the device from sleep. The feature helps households with multiple users maintain separate viewing histories and recommendations, but it can feel like an unnecessary step if you're the sole user.

Fortunately, Apple lets you disable this prompt entirely. Here's how to turn off the user profiles screen and go straight to your Home screen.
