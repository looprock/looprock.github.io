            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18.4, there's a new Ambient Music option that can be added to Control Center. There are four different sound categories, including Sleep, Chill, Productivity, and Wellbeing.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Each category can be added to Control Center separately, and tapping one plays a random selection of sounds or music from that particular category.

You can't choose what's playing from Control Center, but if you play a category and then tap into the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> at the top or access the Now Playing widget, you can skip songs and see the name of what's currently playing.

            A new Apple Store will be opening March 1 <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/retail/traffordcentre/">at the Trafford Centre</a> shopping mall outside of Manchester, in the United Kingdom.

<br/>
Apple's existing store at the mall will be permanently closed starting February 27.

Apple has not shared photos or details about the new Trafford Centre store, but you can expect a modern design that will likely include an Apple Pickup station for in-store pickup of orders that customers have placed on Apple's online store.

Apple Trafford Centre originally opened in 2005.

<br/>
Following the launch of the iPhone 16e, there was some speculation online about how MagSafe magnets might have interfered with the C1 modem's cellular connectivity performance, and this was considered to be a potential reason for the device not supporting MagSafe. But, that explanation is not true, according to Apple.

            Apple has withdrawn its Advanced Data Protection iCloud feature from the United Kingdom following government demands for backdoor access to encrypted user data, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/apple-removes-end-to-end-encryption-feature-from-uk-after-backdoor-order"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. The move comes after UK officials secretly ordered Apple to provide unrestricted access to encrypted iCloud content worldwide.

Customers who are already using Advanced Data Protection, or ADP, will need to manually disable it during an unspecified grace period to keep their iCloud accounts, according to the report.

            Earlier this week, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said all four iPhone 17 models will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/kuo-iphone-17-models-apple-designed-wi-fi-7-chip/">equipped with Apple's first-ever custom-designed Wi-Fi chip</a>.

All four iPhone 17 models will feature an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip, according to Jeff Pu, an analyst who covers companies within Apple's supply chain. He shared this information in a research note with GF Securities earlier this month.
<br/>
<br/>
The entire iPhone 16 lineup already supports Wi-Fi 7, so this is not much of a surprise, but the fact that the chip will be designed by Apple is notable. Apple recently debuted its &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/2 [...]<br>

<br/>
Later this year, Apple plans to eliminate the Qualcomm modem used in the Apple Watch Ultra. Rather than using the C1 modem or another custom Apple chip, Apple plans to switch from using Qualcomm units to MediaTek ones. MediaTek is one of the few companies capable of designing 5G modems.
<br/>
<br/>
In 2026, Apple will debut a new custom modem with support for mmWave 5G. The C1 does not have this capability. The modem with mmWave support will be used in iPhones and "at least one <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>." T [...]<br>
