            The optional <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWUG2LL/A/pro-stand">Pro Stand</a> for Apple's high-end Pro Display XDR monitor is currently sold out on Apple's online store in the U.S., as reported by <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/08/31/pro-display-for-xdr-monitor-stock/"><em>9to5Mac</em>'s Zac Hall</a>. It's unclear if or when the $999 stand will be in stock again, or if this hints at an upcoming refresh to the Pro Display XDR, which was released in December 2019.

            A Texas federal district judge granted a preliminary injunction blocking the enforcement of a controversial age verification law set to enter force September 1. The court determined that House Bill (HB) 1181 was overly broad, even in the narrowest interpretations, and violated the First Amendment and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996.

Aimed at photography enthusiasts, Obscura has a wide range of features, but it is also simple enough that it can be used casually. The updated design puts the camera controls that you need most front and center so they're easily accessible, with additional tools packed into radial menus.

Exposure, focus, white balance, and other parameters can be dialed in using the control options, and haptic feedback makes it feel similar to using an actual camera. The new layout is meant to make it easy to reach controls  [...]<br>

Nor can it yet be forgotten that a lawsuit was instituted against him on the matter of that charity by Mr. John Bold, who afterwards married his, Mr. Harding's, younger and then only unmarried daughter. Under pressure of these attacks, Mr. Harding had resigned his wardenship, though strongly recommended to abstain from doing so both by his friends and by his lawyers. He did, however, resign it, and betook himself manfully to the duties of the small parish of St. Cuthbert's, in the city, of which he was vicar, continuing also to perform those of precentor of the cathedral, a situation of small emolument which had hitherto be [...]<br>
