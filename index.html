It seems like this deal began around Amazon's four-day Prime Day event in early July, but it flew under our radar until a reader let us know about it today.

Apple first released the MacBook Air with the M1 chip in November 2020, as one of the first Macs with an Apple silicon chip, instead of an Intel processor. The configuration being sold for $599 includes the M1 chip, 256GB of storage, and 8GB of RAM, with Gold, Silver, and Space Gray color options all available as of this writing.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Rumors continue to surface about Apple launching an affordable MacBook as early as this year.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1008940" height="1508" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/Low-Cost-MacBook-Feature-A18-Pro.jpg" width="2680"/>
<br/>
Below, we recap all of the reports and rumors so far.
<br/>
<br/>
Taiwanese supply chain publication <em>DigiTimes</em> expects the laptop to have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/11/new-12-9-inch-macbook-launch-this-year-599-price/"><strong>starting price of between $599 and $699</strong></a> in the United States.
<br/>
<br/>
The publication said the lower-cost MacBook will be equipped with a <strong>12.9-inch display</strong>, and a version of the <strong>A18 Pro chip</strong> that debuted in the iPhone 16 Pro models last year. It would become the first Mac to ever use an A-series chip from an iPhone.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-13 08:05:16-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, Apple has a helpful new feature that notifies you when your iPhone's camera lens needs cleaning – something Android devices have offered for years. Here's how to turn on this smart notification system.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1014400" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/clean-back-camera-hint.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
Whenever your iPhone's camera is active, iOS 26 monitors the incoming light for signs of reduced clarity or smudging that could indicate a dirty lens. When triggered, you'll see a discrete alert suggesting you clean your camera lens to improve image quality.
<br/>
<br/>
To benefit from the feature, you'll need an iPhone running iOS 26 (currently in beta). It's currently unclear which models support Lens Cleaning Hints, but you can check by looking for the following toggle:
<br/>
<ol><li>Open <strong>Settings</strong> on your iPhone.</li>
<br/>
<li>Scroll down and tap <strong>Camera</strong>.</li>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Netflix appears to have finished deploying its redesigned interface for Apple TV with version 3.0 of the app now available, bringing a months-long rollout that began with other TV platforms earlier this year to a close. Netflix has been testing a redesigned version of its TV app since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/netflix-tv-app-redesign/">last year</a>, and the new look is a notable departure from the previous design.

<br/>
There is a new home page that has a streamlined, modern design, and Netflix designed it to put content front and center. The redesigned interface loses the left-hand sidebar navigation that Netflix has used since 2018 and replaces it with a top menu bar that relocates Search, Home, Shows, Movies, Games, and My Netflix.
