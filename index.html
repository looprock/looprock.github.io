            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-03 03:39:49-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The MacBook Air is Apple's most popular laptop – a thin, fanless machine that wields quiet power thanks to the efficiency of Apple silicon. While the M4 model isn't exactly old, attention is already turning to its successor.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1009086" height="1408" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/macbook-air-prime-day-2025.jpeg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Apple doesn't telegraph new product launches ahead of time, but we can draw a surprisingly clear picture of what to expect by looking at Apple's silicon roadmap, release cycles, and past upgrades.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Release Timing and Price</h2>
<br/>
Apple appears to have settled into a spring refresh cycle for the MacBook Air. After releasing the M2 model in mid-2022 with an all-new design, Apple skipped 2023 and then delivered back-to-back M3 and M4 MacBook Air updates in March 2024 and March 2025, respectively.

The Powerbeats Fit are designed for working out, playing sports, and other activities where in-ear security is important. The earbuds have silicone tips and a soft silicone wingtip that tucks up against the concha of the ear, holding them in place even during vigorous movement.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, Apple Maps has a feature called Visited Places that when enabled automatically logs where you've been, with the aim of making it easier to revisit your favorite spots or to share locations with friends.

While it can be useful for tracking your travels, you might prefer to keep your location history private. Here's how to disable the feature and clear your history.

<h2>What Is Visited Places?</h2>
<br/>
Visited Places keeps a record of locations you've visited, organizing them by category such as restaurants, shops, or transit stops. The feature is end-to-end encrypted, so Apple can't read your data, and it syncs across all your Apple devices signed into the same account.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Nearly two weeks after the iPhone 17 series launched, analysts at investment banking firm Morgan Stanley said demand for the devices has been "modestly stronger than we originally expected," based on a combination of extended shipping estimates on Apple's online store and information it gathered from Apple's supply chain.

There has been strong early demand for the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max, according to the analysts. However, they said the ultra-thin iPhone Air has faced "relative weakness" in demand so far.

"Our supply chain checks suggest an iPhone 17 build increase is likely imminent," wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring, in a research note today. In the second half of 2025, Apple's supply chain might increase its production of the new iPhones to more than 90 mil [...]<br>

<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Priced at $100, the speaker has a squat, rounded shape with a 3D knit fabric covering and a colorful light ring at the bottom so you know when the speaker is listening. It comes in Jade, Berry, Porcelain, and Hazel. Google says the speaker offers richer, 360-degree sound, balanced acoustics, and the ability to pair multiple speakers together.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iFixit today disassembled the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a>, giving us a look at what's inside and how the ‌AirPods Pro 3‌ have changed in comparison to the AirPods Pro 2. 
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Apple designed the ‌AirPods Pro 3‌ with a new foam-infused tip, and the design change is mainly visible under a microscope. You can see a small layer of foam at the top of the earbud where it meets the ear. 
<br/>
<br/>
The AirPods have a 0.221 Wh battery cell inside, while the case has a single 1.334 Wh battery. The AirPods Pro 2 had two battery cells inside the case, and the change explains why we're down to 24 hours of battery life from the case instead of 30 hours like the AirPods Pro 2. 
<br/>
<br/>
The case has fewer rare earth magnets inside, but they've been placed in different locations to ensure that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> and Qi 2 charging still works as expected.

<br/>
With its ultra-thin titanium frame, large display, and glass back, the ‌iPhone Air‌ takes a different aesthetic direction from the rest of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> lineup. This year's finishes emphasize lightness and subtle sophistication, reflecting the phone's positioning as Apple's thinnest and most design-focused device. 
<br/>
<br/>
Both Apple's frosted and bumper cases noticeably show the device's color. The Air's full-width camera plateau draws attention to the device's color even with a case, making it all the more important to choose wisely.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>”Prioritize sovereignty where it matters most. Not every workload requires sovereign infrastructure — and overengineering can be costly and inefficient. Focus on areas where sovereignty is critical: AI workloads, sensitive data, and operations in regulated industries. Use edge computing to process data locally and reduce compliance risks. Localized cloud options, including sovereign clouds and regional vendors, can help meet legal requirements without compromising agility. A surgical approach to sovereignty ensures strategic alignment and cost-effectiveness.”</p>
