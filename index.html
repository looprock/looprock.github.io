            Software ate the world, AI ate the software and now agents are eating AI. Agents are cool, but they are pretty crappy at doing things reliably in the real world. SuperAGI is addressing this by adding a notion of 'Agent Instructions’ These instructions append to the agent's base prompt via ‘config manager’.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When negativity kicks in at work, it overwhelms your mind and body. One bad day and it appears as if your whole life is falling apart.

When work sucks, it affects your personal life too. The bad mood at work doesn’t end with work. It walks home with you.

To avoid a bad day from ruining your entire week, start by enquiring about what triggered it. Connect with your emotions and learn from them instead of ignoring or avoiding how you feel.

Instead of trying to be productive even on a bad day, be kind and compassionate first. Work can wait.

Create space for positivity by consciously opting to do something you enjoy. Even a small positive action will break the cycle of rumination and get you unstuck.

View the situation by projecting it into the future. Does it seem tiny? Does it even deserve your attention?<br>
