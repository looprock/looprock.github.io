            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>In macOS Tahoe, you can finally export Apple Notes in markdown. This is great, and even exports images and handwriting from the Apple Pencil. You can also bulk export, which is great! Sadly, bulk exporting images and handwriting doesn&rsquo;t work. It saves the images and handwriting in a file called <code>Attachements</code>, but then in the actual note markdown, all references to images are to a file called <code>FallbackImage.png</code>. Also, it exports an sqlite database. I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s in there, it&rsquo;s all gobbledygook to me.</p><br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Apple Watch Ultra 3 replaces the second-generation model that was introduced two years ago in Apple's smartwatch lineup, but how different are the two successive smartwatch generations?

The two Apple Watch Ultra models share the overwhelming majority of their features, so should you consider buying or sticking with the second generation to save money? This breakdown serves as a way to see all the differences that the Ultra 3 brings to the table.
<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Series 11 represents <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-10-vs-series-11/">one of the smallest upgrades</a> to the mainstream model ever, while the Apple Watch Ultra 3 provides a bit bigger but still modest change compared to its predecessor.

So, take the marketshare of Amazon, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud, IBM Red Hat, VMware, and nine other vendors that made the MQ cut.
