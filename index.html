            The M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models that Apple released earlier this year have a display upgrade option that allows you to purchase nano-texture display glass, which is supposed to cut down on glare.

It is the most matte display type that Apple makes, and Apple claims that it is useful for high-end, color-managed workflows or demanding ambient lighting environments.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Google is reportedly scrapping continuous scrolling of search results on desktop and mobile, with the company returning to the old method of dividing results into several pages (via <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185727/google-search-continuous-scrolling-doomscrolling-graveyard">The Verge</a></em>).

Google <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/06/google-search-continous-scrolling-us-desktop/">introduced continuous scrolling</a> on mobile and desktop in 2021 and 2022, respectively. The change was reminiscent of a social media feed, although Google's version was never quite the "infinite scroll" that social network users will be familiar with. Search has typically returned the equivalent of six pages of results in a single scroll, before offering users a "More results" button that keeps the scrol [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple's Podcasts app now shows chapter segments of a podcast when you scrub through a currently playing episode, making it easier to browse through the audio content.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956975" height="714" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/podcasts-scrubbing-chapters-ios-18.jpeg" width="1170"/><div class="center-wrap"><em>Image credit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1do9pg8/ios_18_db2_podcasts_now_shows_chapters_segments/">Reddit user Wristnut</a></em></div>
<br/>
As spotted by Redditor "Wristnut," navigating the timeline across the chapter segments shows the chapter name above the line. Note that this behavior appears in the Podcasts app proper, and it is not currently reproducible on the Lock Screen media controls in ‌iOS 18‌ beta 2.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-06-26 04:23:02-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, Apple has added a new "Keep Downloaded" option when browsing items in iCloud, allowing users to designate which files and folders should remain permanently available locally on their device.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956964" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macos-15-keep-downloaded.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
In previous versions of iOS and macOS, users had limited control over which files and folders were kept offline. iCloud's automatic management system would offload files from the device to free up space, potentially removing files that you might want to keep available at all times. 
<br/>
<br/>
Apple offered no straightforward way to prevent this – until now. In macOS Sequoia, when browsing iCloud Drive in Finder, right-clicking a file or folder reveals the new "Keep Downloaded" option. When enabled, the cloud symbol next to the item is opaque instead of transparent, indicating that it wi [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is rumored to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-x/">planning a revamp</a> of the Apple Watch for the device's tenth anniversary, and <em><a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/exclusive-apple-watch-series-10-cad-renders/">91mobiles</a></em> claims to have sourced CAD renders of what could be the "Apple Watch X" or Apple Watch Series 10 from industry insiders.

<br/>
The site claims that the renders are of a "larger" model featuring a 2-inch display. The current Apple Watch Series 9 has a 1.7-inch display, while the Apple Watch Ultra has a display size of 1.93-inches, so this would be the biggest screen on an Apple Watch so far.
<br/>
<br/>
That said, its dimensions are said to measure roughly 46 x 39.7 x 11.6mm, which would make it bigger overall than the Series 9 but smaller than the Ultra. Othe [...]<br>
