<br/>
The updates fix a bug in WebKit that could allow maliciously crafted content to lead to arbitrary code execution. Apple says on its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214059">security support page</a> that it is aware of a report that the issue may have been exploited.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple's software releases also address several other security vulnerabilities that were not known to have been used in the wild. iOS 17.3, for example, fixes bugs with the Neural Engine, kernel, Mail, Safari, Shortcuts, and more.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today posted an ad specifically focused on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Plus, the larger version of the standard ‌iPhone 15‌ model. In the spot, Apple focuses on the battery life of the device, which is equipped with a higher capacity battery than the ‌iPhone 15‌ due to its larger size.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
In the humorous ad, a man takes a video of a child who is attempting to break a wood plank with his hand. The attempts are unsuccessful well into the night, and the ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus battery is able to record for hours. "Battery goes on and on," reads the tagline at the end of the video.
<br/>
<br/>
This is in fact the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/24/iphone-15-plus-battery-life-ad/">second iPhone 15 Plus battery ad</a> that Apple has uploaded in recent months. The first spot featured a sad receptacle that was missing being able to charge the ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus.

Check In allows you to automatically notify a friend or family member when you've arrived at your destination, reassuring them of your safety.

The scene then transitions to the father nervously sitting at the family's dining room table until he receives a Check In alert letting him know his daughter has arrived at school. The father breathes a sigh of relief as the tagline "Relax, it's &lt;a  [...]<br>

<br/>
As expected, the renders show an overall appearance that is very similar to the ‌iPad Air‌ design used for the fourth- and fifth-generation models, but simply scaled up to accommodate a larger display.
<br/>
<br/>
The most striking difference on the device is a redesigned rear camera unit, which now protrudes from the rear in a longer pill-shape, unlike the single, round protruding cutout on the current ‌iPad Air‌.
