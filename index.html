            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's Beats brand is launching a new celebrity ad campaign today featuring rapper Travis Scott and entitled "DARE TO DREAM." The campaign is inspired by a 2011 tweet from Scott when he was just starting his career, in which he claimed, "One day Travis Scott will be somebody."
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The campaign short film is a "testament to how belief in oneself can manifest into reality" and features a re-creation of his actual childhood bedroom and an appearance by his real mother, Wanda Webster.
<br/>
<br/>
The film depicts a young Scott working on music projects using his <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> and the original Beats Studio headphones, with the scene transforming from his bedroom to a dream of sold-out shows on his just-completed "Circus Maximus" tour spanning multiple legs over the past two years.

            I recently posted a short note about moving from WordPress to Substack after ten years on WP. A number of people replied, commented, or DM’d me to express their dismay, along the lines of “why are you supporting Nazis?”. A few begged me to reconsider. So I did.

            Since the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a> launched, there have been complaints from users who have noticed a static-like sound or a crackling issue when using the earbuds, particularly when Active Noise Cancellation is on but no media is playing. Users have also run into strange high-pitched whistling sounds that happen intermittently.

We shared the issues <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/29/airpods-pro-3-static-complaints/">back in late October</a>, and despite two subsequent firmware updates, the problems haven't been solved.

            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> is not going to bring Fortnite to iOS in Japan as promised because of the fees imposed by Apple's new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> rules, ‌Epic Games‌ CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2001494522300137865?s=20">said on social media</a>. Sweeney complained that Apple did not comply with Japan's Mobile Software Competition Act "honestly" and instead "launched another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking in gross disrespect to the government and people of Japan."

            Ajay Kulkarni from Tiger Data (Co-founder/CEO) is on the pod this week with Adam. He asked him to get vulnerable and trace his path to becoming a CEO. They dig into the themes that have shaped his career, and explore how founder values end up forming company culture (whether you intend them to or not). From his enterprise days to building Timescale (and the rename to Tiger Data), we cover the whole journey — even the haters, because haters gonna hate. Here's where it gets really interesting: Agents in the database! Not the hype. The real thing baby. They get into how fast you can go from idea to shipped these days, what it actually means to talk to your database, and the whole API/CLI/MCP/Skills movement.<br>
