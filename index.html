            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS and iPadOS, Apple includes a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/screenshot-iphone/">built-in screenshot feature</a> that also provides you with the ability to capture an entire webpage on your iPhone or iPad that you can then save or share with someone as a PDF document.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-756742" height="572" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/safari-macos-icon-banner.jpg" width="1024"/>
<br/>
By converting full‑page screenshots into PDFs directly within Safari, you can preserve the exact layout and content of lengthy articles, receipts, or social media threads in a single, shareable file. Using the feature also eliminates the need to stitch together multiple images or rely on third‑party apps, plus the text remains searchable and any images stay crisp. 
<br/>
<br/>
Here's how the feature works.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-05-08 07:37:03-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The first iOS 19 beta is just one month away, and there are already many new features and changes that are expected with it.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Below, we recap the key iOS 19 rumors so far.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S25 lineup back in January, it teased a "one more thing" announcement, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge/">introduced a super thin Galaxy Edge smartphone</a> slated for release later in the year. The Galaxy Edge is now closer to launching, and Samsung is planning an official debut event <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/beyond-slim-discover-unprecedented-innovation-with-galaxy-s25-edge">on Monday, May 12</a> at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time (or May 13 at 9:00 a.m., for those in South Korea).

Samsung showed off some limited pictures of the Galaxy Edge earlier this year, and it will be notably thinner than Samsung's current S25 lineup. It won't be as expensive as the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but it will have the same flagship features as the rest of the S25 lineup, suggesting it is a mid-tier device much like Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17</a> [...]<br>

Netflix has been testing a redesigned version of its TV app <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/netflix-tv-app-redesign/">since last year</a>, and the new look is a notable departure from the current design.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
There is a new home page that has a streamlined, modern design, and Netflix designed it to put content front and center. Shows are organized into different categories as they are now, but each section will feature a large main card that has information like release date and show or movie description. Navigating through each show will display the same information for other content in the section, without the need to click in to a show to get more details.

<br/>
Introduced in March, the ‌MacBook Air‌ is equipped with Apple's latest and greatest M4 chip, so it's more than capable of handling day-to-day tasks from web browsing and watching videos to getting work done. It's even powerful enough for photo editing and some light video editing work.

All Macs have a minimum of 16GB RAM now, so the base M4 ‌MacBook Air‌ that starts at $999 is a really good deal for what you get. You can upgrade the RAM and the SSD, which may be worthwhile depending on what you want to do on your Mac.
