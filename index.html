            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's rumored plan to enter the smart glasses market by late 2026 is already reshaping the global AR optics supply chain, according to <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20260202PD210.html"><em>DigiTimes</em></a>.

<br/>
According to the paywalled report, demand for smart glasses from the likes of Meta is rising steadily, but the industry now expects Apple's equivalent product to act as the primary catalyst for large-scale commercialization. Multiple suppliers across Taiwan's optical sector have apparently increased capital expenditure to expand capacity and shift research priorities toward AR technologies, citing Apple's expected requirements.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, Kinko Optical has positioned itself as a key supplier by opening a new AR, VR, and MR research center, backed by an investment of about $5.6 mil [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Google shows that large language models, when paired with traditional tools and validation pipelines, can accelerate enterprise code migrations by 50% or more, unblocking projects stalled for years.</p>
<p>The robot says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most dramatic impact occurred in previously stalled migrations, which AI unblocked after years of delay. One migration achieved an 89% estimated time savings, while another processed 149,000+ lines across 5,359 files in three months. Review, not generation, became the primary bottleneck. Google mitigated this by throttling weekly AI-generated changes to avoid overwhelming reviewers.</p>

According <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/the-ai-boom-is-coming-for-apples-profit-margins-4774013d">to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, Apple is exploring whether some of its lower-end processors could be manufactured by a company other than TSMC.
<br/>
<br/>
"Now that TSMC is doing more business with Nvidia and other AI companies, people with knowledge of the chip supply chain said Apple was exploring whether some lower-end processors could be made by someone other than TSMC," the report said.
<br/>
<br/>
The report did not mention any candidates, but previous rumors have indicated that Intel could begin supplying some lower-end Apple processors in 2027 or 2028.

At Yelp, Ad Budget Allocation means splitting each campaign’s spend between on‑platform inventory (our website, mobile site, and app) and off‑platform inventory (the Yelp Ad Network). We optimize this split to meet advertisers’ performance goals while growing overall revenue. Due to the complexity of the budget allocation system and its feedback loop, even small changes can lead to unexpected system‑wide effects. To help us safely evaluate changes,...<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is planning to launch new MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips alongside macOS 26.3, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.

"Apple's faster MacBook Pros are planned for the macOS 26.3 release cycle," wrote Gurman, in his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-01/apple-s-record-quarter-and-ai-changes-macbook-pro-update-clamshell-iphone-fold"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today.

<br/>
"I'm told the new models — code-named J714 and J716 — are slated for the macOS 26.3 software cycle, which runs from February through March," he explained.
<br/>
<br/>
macOS 26.3 remains in beta testing, but the update should be coming soon, with a wide release expected in February. Gurman was careful to also mention March, but this seems rather unlikely, unless the macOS 26.3 bet [...]<br>

            Apple recently <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/">updated its online store</a> with a new ordering process for Macs, including the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, Mac mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro.

There used to be a handful of standard configurations available for each Mac, but now you must configure a Mac entirely from scratch on a feature-by-feature basis. In other words, ordering a new Mac now works much like ordering an iPad.
