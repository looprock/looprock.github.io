            Spotify, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, Deezer, Paddle, and several other developers and EU associations today <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-03-01/a-letter-to-the-european-commission-on-apples-lack-of-dma-compliance/">sent a joint letter</a> to the European Commission to complain about Apple's "proposed scheme for compliance" with the Digital Markets Act (DMA).

<br/>
The 34 companies and associations do not believe Apple's plans "meet the law's requirements." Apple's changes "disregard both the spirit and letter of the law" and if left unchanged, will "make a mockery of the DMA," according to the letter. Several specific components of Apple's plan are highlighted, including the Core Technology Fee, the Notarization process, and the terms that developers must accept.

            Following intense criticism, Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu">today walked back its plan</a> to disable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> web apps in the European Union starting with iOS 17.4.

Web apps could no longer launch from the ‌Home Screen‌ in their own top-level window that takes up the entire screen, relegating them to a simple shortcut with an option to open within Safari instead.
