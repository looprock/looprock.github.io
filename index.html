            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-24 08:20:02-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In the iOS 26 beta, Apple has redesigned the alarm screen in the Clock app, giving it a cleaner look with a larger time display and significantly bigger buttons. When the alarm goes off, you'll now see two large, equal-sized buttons for Stop and Snooze placed side by side at the bottom of the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1007849" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/iOS-18-vs-26-Alarms.jpg" width="2500"/><div class="center-wrap"><em>Alarm screen in iOS 18 (left) versus iOS 26 beta 2</em></div>
<br/>
While the redesign fits with Apple's broader visual refresh in iOS 26, it also seems to address a problem the company had already solved: reducing the chances of you hitting Stop instead of Snooze when you're half-awake and fumbling for your phone. Ironically, internal testing once showed that making both buttons the same size actually made that mistake more likely.

The ‌iPhone‌ 4 first became available to customers on June 24, 2010, following its unveiling by then-CEO Steve Jobs at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference earlier that month. It was the first ‌iPhone‌ to feature a high-resolution "Retina" display, with a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch, making individual pixels imperceptible at a standard viewing distance. Apple described it at the time as offering "four times the pixel density of previous displays," resulting in crisper text and sharper images.

The combination enables tighter integration of the panel along the display's edges, which could end up shrinking the visible bezels and creating more scree [...]<br>

Following years of rumors, Apple in June 2020 unveiled its plan to transition the entire Mac lineup from Intel processors to its own custom-designed chips.

<br/>
Later that year saw the release of the first three Mac models powered by Apple silicon, including a 13-inch MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and Mac mini.

<br/>
Apple had plenty of experience after a decade of making custom iPhone and iPad chips, and it was time for the Mac to switch from x86 to Arm architecture.

            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> beta 2 adds full support for the order tracking feature that Apple announced at WWDC. In the Wallet app, there is an option to let <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> scan your Mail app to find all orders and emails from merchants, even if those orders weren't made with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>.

<br/>
The Wallet app previously had an order tracking feature, but it was only an option when an order was made using ‌Apple Pay‌.
<br/>
<br/>
Order tracking was partially working in the initial ‌iOS 26‌ beta, but the functionality was limited. The Wallet app is now able to scan your email and pull in all recent order emails with &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-inte [...]<br>

            In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> beta 2, Apple updated the location of the new tab icon in Safari, fixing a frustrating change that was made in the first ‌iOS 26‌ beta.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In macOS Tahoe Beta 2, Apple included a new option to add a background to the menu bar, making it possible to have a menu bar design that’s similar to the menu bar in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1007714" height="1148" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/macos-tahoe-show-menu-bar-background.jpg" width="2041"/>
<br/>
As part of macOS Tahoe’s Liquid Glass design, Apple removed the background of the menu bar, so it blends into the wallpaper or background behind it. The icons of the menu bar are more free floating with the transparent look, though Apple does add a slight gradient to wallpapers to improve visibility.
<br/>
<br/>
The menu bar toggle is available in the System Settings app under the Menu Bar section. Turning it on clearly delineates the background from the menu bar for those that prefer the non-transparent aesthetic.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In the initial macOS Tahoe beta, Apple swapped the colors of the Finder icon, a longtime Mac classic. Rather than featuring blue on the left side of the face and light blue on the right side, the icon was primarily white and the right side of the face was blue.

<br/>
The updated Finder look was a significant deviation from the design that Apple has used for Finder since 1996, and many Mac users were <a href="https://512pixels.net/2025/06/wwdc25-macos-tahoe-breaks-decades-of-finder-history/">unhappy with the change</a>. Apple had tweaked the Finder colors and design slightly over the years, but the first Tahoe beta marked the first significant change that we've seen because of the decision to put the darker color on the right.
