            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            On this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/we-fixed-apples-product-lines/id1602394741?i=1000622656609">The MacRumors Show</a>, we talk through how we would make changes to Apple's product lines in an attempt to make them simpler and more consumer-friendly.

Today, Apple sells eight <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models, six iPads, six MacBooks, four desktop Macs, two external displays, and four sets of AirPods. Some product ranges, such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> lineup, have been subject to particular criticism in recent years for being overwhelming and confusing for average consumers. We discuss how Apple could simplify its offerings by presenting a clearer selection of form-factors, product names, and price points. Let u [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-07-28 15:33:32+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            5G is faster and more flexible than 4G, but it carries cybersecurity risks. These include increased attack surfaces, the security vulnerabilities of IoT, GPRS tunneling protocols, connection to legacy networks, increased bandwidth, network function virtualization, reliance on software, and IMSI encryption weaknesses. However, there are advantages, including heightened responsiveness, encrypted traffic, and data segregation.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Earlier this week, Apple started accepting applications for one-day <a href="https://developer.apple.com/visionos/labs/">Vision Pro developer labs</a> in Cupertino, London, Munich, Shanghai, Singapore, and Tokyo. These coding labs will allow developers to test and optimize their apps on visionOS, and Apple employees will be available to help with setup and troubleshooting.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            One thing was certain, that the white kitten had had nothing to do with it:—it was the black kitten’s fault entirely. For the white kitten had been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it couldn’t have had any hand in the mischief.

The way Dinah washed her children’s faces was this: first she held the poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw she rubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and just now, as I said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which was lying quite still and trying to purr—no doubt feeling that it was all meant for its good.<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-07-28 14:51:58+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Begin with an individual, and before you know it you find that you have created a type; begin with a type, and you find that you have created—nothing. That is because we are all queer fish, queerer behind our faces and voices than we want any one to know or than we know ourselves. When I hear a man proclaiming himself an "average, honest, open fellow," I feel pretty sure that he has some definite and perhaps terrible abnormality which he has agreed to conceal—and his protestation of being average and honest and open is his way of reminding himself of his misprision.

There are no types, no plurals. There is a rich boy, and this is his and not his brothers' story. All my life I have lived among his brothers but this one has been my friend. Besides, if I wrote about his brothers I should have to begin by attacking all the lies that the poor have told about the rich and the rich have told about themselves—such a wild structure they have erected that when we pick up a book about the rich, some instinct prepares u [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-07-28 14:51:15+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Jim Powell was a Jelly-bean. Much as I desire to make him an appealing character, I feel that it would be unscrupulous to deceive you on that point. He was a bred-in-the-bone, dyed-in-the-wool, ninety-nine three-quarters per cent Jelly-bean and he grew lazily all during Jelly-bean season, which is every season, down in the land of the Jelly-beans well below the Mason-Dixon line.

Now if you call a Memphis man a Jelly-bean he will quite possibly pull a long sinewy rope from his hip pocket and hang you to a convenient telegraph-pole. If you call a New Orleans man a Jelly-bean he will probably grin and ask you who is taking your girl to the Mardi Gras ball. The particular Jelly-bean patch which produced the protagonist of this history lies somewhere between the two—a little city of forty thousand that has dozed sleepily for forty thousand years in southern Georgia, occasionally stirring in its slumbers and muttering something about a war that took place sometime, somewhere, and that everyone else has forgotten l [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-07-28 13:48:47+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Crisis communication is more than just damage control; it's a strategic opportunity for narrative shaping and brand storytelling in our digitally interconnected world. Despite the swift, potentially devastating impact of crises, many businesses operate under a 'it will never happen to us' mindset, leading to dangerous underpreparedness. A Capterra survey revealed that only 49% of US companies have a solid crisis communication strategy, underscoring the urgent need for comprehensive planning. Effective crisis management not only mitigates damage but can also demonstrate a brand's values, resilience, and accountability. As an example, Slack's transparent approach to their outage crisis in 2022 shifted potential disaster into an opportunity to strengthen user relationships. We need to shed the dismissive mentality and embrace readiness for the unexpected, thus ensuring we can shape our narrative no matter what comes our way.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In an effort to bolster user privacy, developers will need to justify their use of certain Apple APIs before their apps can be listed on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, according to a new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_use_of_required_reason_api">article on the Apple developer website</a> spotted by <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/07/27/app-store-describe-app-api/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a>.

<br/>
The Apple Developer website now lists some APIs as "Required Reason APIs," meaning that developers have to clarify why they are using them in their privacy manifest. Some commonly used APIs, such as UserDefaults, which stores user preferences, now fall under the Required Reason category.
