As a long-term strategic planning facilitator, my work confronts issues that most executive teams skim over in their customary short-term, emergency-driven thinking. Getting them to think about abstract questions for long hours at a time, while sitting face to face with their peers isn’t easy.&rdquo; // The irony, in a good way, of Godin&rsquo;s work is that it&rsquo;s mostly aphoristic: short, punchy, and memorable. Less of a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213458886">book</a>, and more of a chapbook or blog posts, Tweets, etc. The perfect length, tone, and cleverness that an executive likes and can use in bureaucratic knife-fighting.<!-- category:link --></p><br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18, Apple has introduced a clever new way to identify if your iPhone charging setup is running at less than optimal speeds. The new feature appears directly in Settings, making it easy to spot when you're not getting the fastest possible charge.
<br/>

<br/>
The Battery section displays a <strong>Slow Charger</strong> message when your iPhone detects a "slow" charger in use. You'll also see charging periods with an orange bar. This visual indicator appears in both the 24-hour and 10-day battery usage views.

<h2>What Makes a Charger "Slow"?</h2>

<ul>
<br/>
<li>Wired chargers providing 7.5W or less power</li>
<br/>
<li>Standard Qi1 wireless chargers (less than 10W)</li>

Compared to the prior version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, the M4 model is densely packed with little space between components, which is how Apple slimmed down the size so much. The ‌M4 Mac mini‌ measures in at 5x5 inches, down from 7.5x7.5 inches, a size reduction that makes a major difference.

The power supply module is a board that extends across the top of the case, a design that Apple has previously used for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>. The power supply normally takes up a lot of space, so that's how Apple shrunk it down without compromising performance.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple TV+ today shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceYm0eDw7tg">recap video</a> for the first season of "Silo. The hit series returns for a second season starting later this week.
<br/>
<br/>
Warning: The video contains major spoilers, obviously.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
"Silo" follows the last 10,000 people on Earth, all of whom live in a massive underground bunker to escape the seemingly toxic and deadly world outside. The people are unaware of why the silo was built, and those who seek the truth face deadly consequences. Rebecca Ferguson stars as Juliette Nichols, an engineer who attempts to unravel the mysteries surrounding the silo following a loved one's murder. The sci-fi series is based on Hugh Howey's best-selling book trilogy "Wool." Ferguson and Howey both serve as executive producers.
