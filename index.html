            Leveraged trading is a strategy that allows traders to gain amplified exposure to an asset using borrowed funds. It involves using leverage, which is essentially trading with borrowed capital to increase potential profits. In leveraged trading, traders can open positions that exceed their available capital, allowing them to control larger positions. This can lead to higher potential returns, but it also comes with increased risks, as losses can be magnified.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 include a new Screen Distance feature that can alert you when you hold an iPhone or iPad too close to your eyes for an extended period. Apple says the opt-in feature is designed to help lower the risk of nearsightedness in children by encouraging healthy viewing habits, and can help reduce eye strain overall.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Initially, Hadoop integrated storage and compute, but the emergence of cloud computing led to a separation of these components. Object storage emerged as an alternative to HDFS but had limitations. To complement these limitations, JuiceFS, an open source distributed file system, offers cost-effective solutions for data-intensive scenarios like computation, analysis, and training. The decision to adopt storage-compute separation depends on factors like scalability, performance, cost, and compatibility.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If you change your iPhone's passcode and forget it soon after, iOS 17 has a new option available to help out. Specifically, it is now possible to reset an iPhone's new passcode with the previous passcode for up to 72 hours after the change is made.

<br/>
If you enter an incorrect passcode, tapping on "Forgot Passcode?" at the bottom of the screen will lead to another screen with a "Try Passcode Reset" option. Tapping this option allows you to enter the iPhone's previous passcode and create a new passcode.
<br/>
<br/>
As a safeguard, an option in the Settings app lets you expire the previous passcode immediately so that it cannot be used to reset the new passcode.

            To be honest, I’m somewhat amazed that more copyright lawsuits haven’t been filed against Twitter yet. There have been multiple reports of how the company’s DMCA takedown response systems have been broken/ignored since Musk took over. Without looking for it, I’ve seen full length high def movies show up in my Twitter feed (including movies [&#8230;]<br>
