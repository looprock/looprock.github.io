            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Next year's Apple Watch lineup will not include any major design changes, with a redesign not expected before 2028, according to the leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/Qe6lgueqd">Instant Digital</a>.

<br/>
In a Weibo post in Chinese (machine translated), the leaker said Apple's watch 2026 lineup would not look significantly different, and suggested Apple would not reveal a new design until the year after the release of its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/20th-anniversary-iphone-all-screen-report/">20th anniversary iPhone</a>, expected in late 2027.

<br/>
Chat is rolling out on iOS now via the X app, and it includes support for video and voice calls, disappearing messages, and file sharing, as well as the ability to edit and delete previously sent messages. 
<br/>
<br/>
Any old messages should be carried across to Chat from the old DM system on X (formerly Twitter). Users also have options to block screenshots and get notified of attempts to take them. However, it's worth noting that the E2EE support doesn't encrypt message metadata, and this can include information about the sender as well as the recipient. 
<br/>
<br/>
X also says that its system lacks safeguards against man-in-the-middle attacks, meaning an encrypted chat could be intercepted without either partic [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is developing official iPhone cases that act like secondary touch interfaces for future devices, claims a new rumor out of China.

<br/>
According to known Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/Qe70h46J1">Instant Digital</a>, Apple is looking to make protective cases for its Pro models that directly integrate touch-based sensor layers.
<br/>
<br/>
The leaker provided no further details, but there are some clues to be found in previous research conducted by Apple. A patent application filed by the company in 2024 describes a "<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20240393888A1/en">case with input for an electronic device</a>" and outlines a protective iPhone case designed to act as an input surface rather than passive shielding.

            It's hard to believe we're halfway through November already, as 2025 rapidly draws to a close with no firm signs of several smaller hardware updates we've been hoping to see before the end of the year, although we did get one surprising new iPhone accessory this week.
