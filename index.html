            <b>Published:</b> 2024-05-06 09:14:34-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            While the iPhone 16 series is still months away from launching, an early rumor about an all-new iPhone 17 model has now surfaced.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911674" height="898" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Colors-yellow.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
In a research note with investment firm Haitong this week, analyst Jeff Pu said Apple is planning a so-called "iPhone 17 Slim" model that would replace the Plus model in the lineup. Pu said this model will feature around a 6.6-inch display, a slimmer design, an A18 or A19 chip, 8GB of RAM, a 24-megapixel front camera, and a 48-megapixel telephoto camera.
<br/>
<br/>
Pu expects the iPhone 17 Slim to have an aluminum chassis, rather than titanium like the Pro models. He expects the device to have some external design changes, but he did not share any specific details.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 17 lineup in September 2025.<div class="linkback">Tags: &lt;a href="https</div> [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-05-06 08:09:01-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            A reference to an unreleased "Apple Pencil Pro" has been <a href="https://twitter.com/ribu_ap712/status/1787461116211479032">spotted in the source code</a> for Apple's homepage in Japan. We have independently confirmed that the code exists, but it would be unsurprising if Apple removes it after it was discovered.

<br/>
This finding suggests that an Apple Pencil Pro could be announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/watch-let-loose-apple-event-may-7/">at the Apple Event tomorrow</a>. However, given the code does not appear on Apple's homepage in the U.S. or other countries, there is a chance that the Japanese website made a translation error.

            Apple today updated Apple.com with a teaser for tomorrow's event, adding an interactive erasing feature that seems to hint at a refreshed version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>.

<br/>
Hovering over the Apple logo and moving the mouse allows the current artwork to be erased and replaced with a new logo design. Apple created a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-event-has-six-artistic-logos/">total of six logos</a> for the May 7 "Let Loose" event, and the interactive eraser cycles through those options.

            <p>Business models are fascinating. Most business models come down to a type of arbitrage, at least as I understand it. You find something you have that you can sell to someone else, crucially, at a price above what it cost you to make that thing.<a class="footnote-anchor" href="https://cote.io/feed.xml#footnote-1" id="footnote-anchor-1" target="_self">1</a> In, let’s call it, The Capatalist Upbrining, there is a major intellectual jump where you understand that the price for a think is not determined by what it cost to make it, the costs of goods sold.
