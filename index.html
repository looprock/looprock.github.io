The update includes the ability to add up to ten "Topics" to your bio, which can be used to showcase your interests and connect with like-minded users.

<br/>
Search in Gmail has traditionally returned results from your inbox in chronological order based on keywords. That's not great if the email you need was sent months or years ago.

What the new method does to improve things is factor in elements like how often you contact someone, which emails you've clicked the most, and how recently the emails arrived in your inbox.

"With this update, the emails you're looking for are far more likely to be at the top of your search results — saving you valuable time and helping you find important information more easily," claims Google.

Apple has reportedly chosen liquid metal, which is manufactured using a die-casting process, as a key component in addressing common issues with foldable devices. The design choice aims to enhance screen flatness and minimize the crease marks that typically plague folding displays.

Kuo notes that Apple has previously used liquid metal in smaller components like SIM ejector pins, but the foldable iPhone will mark the company's first major use of the material in a critical mechanical part. Dongguan EonTec will reportedly be the exclusive supplier of liquid metal.

            Earlier this week, the investment firm GF Securities shared multiple research notes regarding Apple's future chips. In one of these notes, it said the A20 chip for the iPhone 18 series would be manufactured <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/a20-chip-still-3nm-rumor/">with TSMC's third-generation 3nm process</a>, N3P, and in another it said that the chip would use TSMC's newer 2nm process N2.

<br/>
GF Securities is a large organization with many analysts, and it seems like some wires got crossed. In an email to <em>MacRumors</em>, the firm's lead Apple analyst Jeff Pu has since clarified that he believes the A20 chip will be manufactured with the N2 process, so the information about the chip using the N3P process should be disregarded.
