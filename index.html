            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple on Tuesday made <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-usb-c-iphone-airpods-earpods/">second-generation AirPods Pro with a USB-C charging case</a> available to order, but unlike its move to wireless charging cases, the company isn't offering the USB-C case as a standalone purchase.

<br/>
Apple's decision not to offer the USB-C case as a separate purchase is likely a marketing one related to the fact that the updated second-generation AirPods Pro feature improved IP54-rated dust resistance, and will support up to 4 hours of lossless audio with ultra-low latency when connected to the Apple Vision Pro headset launching in early 2024.

With Wi-Fi 6E support, the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ and Pro Max can connect to the 6GHz band offered by Wi-Fi 6E routers for faster speeds, improved latency, and less interference from other devices.

            At today's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> event, Apple introduced an add-on feature to Emergency SOS via Satellite called Roadside Assistance via Satellite.

<br/>
5x optical zoom allows for 25x digital zoom, and while that's the most zoom an Apple device has offered, it still falls below the competition.

Samsung's latest Galaxy S23 Ultra smartphone has 100x Space Zoom that can capture images from 330 feet away. The Pixel 7 Pro has 30x digital "Super Res Zoom" with its 5x optical zoom lens.
