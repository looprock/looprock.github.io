<br/>
The Meta-owned service warned that the case "could set a dangerous precedent" by encouraging other governments to demand access to encrypted communications.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple launched legal action after receiving a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/07/uk-government-orders-access-icloud/">secret government notice</a> earlier this year demanding backdoor access to encrypted iCloud data worldwide. The UK used its Investigatory Powers Act to require Apple to compromise its Advanced Data Protection feature, which encrypts user photos, notes, messages, and device backups. [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-11 04:36:42-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has released a unique haptic trailer for its upcoming "F1" movie starring Brad Pitt, available exclusively in the TV app on iPhone.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005574" height="3030" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/f1-trailer-haptic.jpeg" width="5386"/>
<br/>
The trailer uses the iPhone's Taptic Engine to create vibrations that sync with the on-screen action. When F1 cars roar around the track, you can physically feel the engine vibrations in your hands. The haptic effects match the intensity of what's happening on screen, ramping up as engines rev and providing subtle feedback for smaller actions like a bouncing ping pong ball.
<br/>
<br/>
To experience the trailer, iPhone users need iOS 18.4 or later and can find it featured in the TV+ tab of the TV app.
<br/>
<br/>
In the film, Brad Pitt stars as an F1 driver who was an up-and-coming talent in the 1990s, until an accident on the track nearly ended his career. Thirty years later, Pitt  [...]<br>

<br/>
Federighi admitted that the first-generation architecture that Apple was developing for the personalized Siri features was too limited, which prevented the features from reaching the company's high quality standards.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iPadOS 26, Apple is introducing major changes to the way that multitasking works, and part of that update will see the removal of Split View and Slide Over, two multitasking interface options that have long existed on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. 
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
iPadOS 26 allows for multiple app windows, each of which can be resized freely on the display. The feature works on all ‌iPad‌ models able to run iPadOS 26, though there are limitations on how many apps can be open at once. On older iPads, for example, you're limited to four apps. Newer iPads can have more open app windows.

<br/>
Apple tends to quietly remove some watch face options when it launches a new version of iOS, so it is not a huge surprise to see these go missing. It is not clear why Apple picked these watch faces in particular, but it could be because they were used less often.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple didn't add new watch faces with watchOS 26, but some watch faces have new Liquid Glass-inspired design options.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com</div> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Apple offered a line of Wi-Fi routers that it referred to as AirPort base stations. There was a standard AirPort Express, a higher-end AirPort Extreme with more advanced networking features, and an AirPort Time Capsule that doubled as an external storage drive for backing up a Mac with Time Machine.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Following its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/wwdc-2025-live-coverage/">WWDC keynote</a> on Monday, Apple updated a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/about-the-rosetta-translation-environment">developer document</a> to indicate that Rosetta 2 will remain available through macOS 27.

Rosetta 2 enables Macs with Apple silicon (Arm architecture) to run apps that were built for Macs with an Intel processor (x86 architecture), by translating code.
<br/>
<br/>
Starting with macOS 28, Apple said that only a limited version of Rosetta 2 will remain available for older games that rely on Intel-based frameworks:<blockquote>Rosetta was designed to make the transition to Apple silicon easier, and we plan to make it available for the next two major macOS releases – through macOS 27 – as </blockquote> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has released the first iOS 26 beta to developers, but even non-developers have the opportunity to download beta software updates on their iPhones for free. Keep reading to learn how it's done.

<br/>
Traditionally, when Apple announced a major new operating system update, the first wave of betas would only be available to download by paying subscribers to <a href="https://developer.apple.com">Apple's Developer Program</a>, which costs $99 a year. Public betas would then become available to users enrolled in <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/welcome">Apple's Public Beta Software Program</a> after a delay of a few days or weeks after the developer beta has been released. That all changed in 2023, and these days iPhone users no longer have to wait for a publicly released beta to test what's new.

            This article was originally published in 2018, yet its core insights into Go’s garbage collection model remain highly relevant for developers today. While some implementation details of Go’s runtime have evolved, the foundational concepts explored here—such as the semantics of the tri-color mark and sweep algorithm, Stop The World (STW) events, and GC trace interpretation—are still essential to understanding how Go manages memory. Whether you&rsquo;re optimizing performance or deepening your knowledge of Go internals, this post continues to offer a clear and practical guide to working with the garbage collector, not against it.<br>
