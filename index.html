            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is preparing to launch two versions of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a> over 2025 and 2026, according to a Weibo leaker.

<br/>
Yesterday, supply chain analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/07/airpods-pro-3-this-year-per-kuo/">reported</a> that Apple is planning to debut the ‌AirPods Pro 3‌ this year. They could arrive as soon as this week at Apple's "Awe dropping" event. 
<br/>
<br/>
Crucially, Kuo added that Apple is planning to introduce a successor to this year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> in 2026. This would be somewhat unusual since Apple normally waits around three years to make major changes to the AirPods' hardware. ‌AirPods Pro&amp;zw [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Just ahead of Apple unveiling the iPhone 17 series <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/watch-iphone-17-apple-event-sep-9/">on Tuesday</a>, it appears that battery capacities for the devices have surfaced in a Chinese regulatory database.

<br/>
The table below lists the alleged battery capacities for each model, which were shared in a post on X today <a href="https://x.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1964884846100254931">by an account known as ShrimpApplePro</a>. 
<br/>
<br/>
The database suggests that the iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will be available with and without a physical SIM card slot, depending on the country of sale. For the base model iPhone 17, however, it appears that only one battery capacity for that device has been discovered in the database so far.

            <p>Every day, shoppers from Etsy's community of nearly 90M buyers visit our marketplace to search for unique, handmade, and vintage items. But with over 100 million listings, how do we help each buyer find exactly what they're looking for? Traditional search and recommendation systems often fall short of capturing the nuanced interests that make each Etsy buyer unique, from specific styles to aesthetic preferences. At Etsy, understanding our buyers' interests is central to delivering engaging, personalized experiences. </p>
<p>Recently, we explored enhancing our personalization by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to create detailed buyer profiles based on buyers’ browsing and purchasing behaviors. We build these profiles in alignment with privacy laws and requirements such as the GDPR and the CCPA/CPRA. Buyers have the ability to opt-out, so that they can choose not to have a profile generated at all.</p>
