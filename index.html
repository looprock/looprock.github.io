Mac rumors have been confusing in recent months, but there are several possibilities. We could see a refreshed version of the 24-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, as that machine is still using an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> Apple silicon chip. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> has said &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023 [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-10-24 08:54:20-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            For a brief period following the release of new iPhone models, Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers must replace the entire device if a customer requires a repair, as individual parts are not immediately available.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910920" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Internal-Chassis.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
Starting this week, parts are available for all four iPhone 15 models, allowing Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers to complete same-unit repairs for these devices, according to an internal memo obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>. This includes the back glass, battery, speakers, display, rear camera, and mid-frame.
<br/>
<br/>
A whole-unit replacement is still required for repairs involving the Taptic Engine or the main microphone on the iPhone 15 Pro or the iPhone 15 Pro Max, as those parts will not be available until a later time, according to the memo.

<br/>
Passkeys are a more secure alternative to passwords because a passkey cannot be shared with another person through a phishing attempt or leaked online through a database hack. Passkeys do not require customers to remember a password or add a two-factor authentication code, but they do require a verified device.
