Last week, we were first to report that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/ios-17-1-1-is-coming/">internally testing iOS 17.1.1</a>, based on evidence of the software version in our website's analytics logs. The update will almost certainly be focused on bug fixes and security patches.

It's unclear exactly which bugs will be addressed in iOS 17.1.1. The update might include the same <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/ios-17-2-beta-addresses-wifi-issues/">fix for </a> [...]<br>

The USB-C ‌Apple Pencil‌ is compatible with all iPads that have a USB-C port and that are running iOS 17.1 or later.

When it comes to design and feel, the USB-C ‌Apple Pencil‌ is much like the second-generation ‌Apple Pencil‌, featuring a matte finish and a flat side where it can attach to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, but it's worth noting that it's shorter. Unlike the ‌Apple Pencil‌ 2, it is not able to pair with an ‌iPad‌ automatically, and you'll need a USB-C cable for pairing purposes.

Apple's custom battery technology has reportedly been in the works since 2018, with the company actively seeking patents and hiring new personnel related to the project.

Apple is apparently curating the battery's cathode materials to determine its performance, energy density, output, and stability. The battery apparently uses a completely different composition from those that currently exist on the market, adopting a new compo [...]<br>
