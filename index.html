            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-26 02:40:19-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In macOS, a Text Clipping is a selection of text that you've dragged from an application to another location on your Mac, where it becomes a unique kind of standalone file. 
<br/>
<br/>
The relatively little-known feature has been around since at least Mac OS 9, and it offers a convenient way to save out pieces of text from pretty much anywhere for later use in another app or document.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991857" height="2880" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/macos-text-clippings-hidden-feature.jpg" width="5120"/>
<br/>
To create a Text Clipping, simply highlight any piece of text, then hold left-click and drag it with your mouse to your Desktop or an open Finder window. 
<br/>
<br/>
This saves the highlighted text – including any rich text formatting – as a <strong>.textclipping</strong> file named after the first few words of text that you selected, but you can easily rename it to make it more identifiable.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            I am, unabashedly, a Humean emotivist. Like David Hume, I hold that emotions—not abstract reason—form the foundation of our ethics. Cold logic alone doesn&#8217;t guide our moral compass; it is shaped by the deep wellspring of human feeling. This isn&#8217;t a rejection of reason, but a recognition of its limits and its partnership with emotion in [&#8230;]<br>

            I realize that using the word &#8220;racist&#8221; to describe an ExTwitter account is pretty much redundant at this point, but there&#8217;s something more to this story. It&#8217;s not that a racist is using ExTwitter to make racist posts. It&#8217;s that a prosecutor working for ICE is, and has been, posting racist content for years on [&#8230;]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-25 13:18:24-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Multiple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owners today noticed a pronunciation processing issue that causes the word "Trump" to momentarily show up when using dictation to send a message with the word "racist."

<br/>
In some cases, when speaking the word racist through the ‌iPhone‌'s built-in dictation feature, the ‌iPhone‌ briefly interprets the spoken word as "Trump" and "Trump" text shows up in the Messages app before being corrected to the actual word (racist) as Apple's processing interprets what was said.
<br/>
<br/>
Speaking the word racist with dictation doesn't always show "Trump" first, though it did show up more often than other words in our testing. We also saw "Rhett" and "Rouch" appear before the ‌iPhone‌ corrects to racist.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            LG TV owners can now install the Philips Hue Sync TV app to synchronize their lights with content on the TV without the need for an additional set-top box.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Hue parent company Signify said in January that the app would expand to LG TVs in early 2025, and it is now available from the <a href="https://us.lgappstv.com/main/tvapp/detail?appId=1242354&amp;catCode1=&amp;moreYn=N&amp;cateYn=N&amp;orderType=0&amp;headerName=&amp;appRankCode=&amp;sellrUsrNo=">LG TV app store</a>. Previously, the app was limited to Samsung TVs.
<br/>
<br/>
The app is priced at $130 without a subscription, or $3 per month, and it works with 2024 LG Smart TVs that run webOS 24. The app is expensive, but it is more affordable than the Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box that costs $350.

<div class="center-wrap"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>

The Find N5 has a 6.62-inch display when closed, and an 8.12-inch display when open, so when unfolded, it's just a bit smaller than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>.

<br/>
While no noticeable design changes are expected for the third generation since the company tends to stick with the same Apple Watch design through three generations before changing it, there are a series of internal upgrades on the way.
<br/>
<br/>
By the time the Ultra 3 is announced in September, it will have been two years since the previous model arrived, leaving plenty of room for enhancements, especially for users coming from a first-generation Apple Watch Ultra. Here are all of the major new features we're likely to see in the Apple Watch Ultra 3:

            A few months ago, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman reported that Apple was in the early stages of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/22/apple-doorbell-with-face-id-rumor/">developing a smart home doorbell</a> and lock system with Face ID.

On select iPhones, MagSafe lets you attach a charger or other accessories to the device magnetically.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok 3 was caught temporarily censoring information about its own creator and US president Donald Trump over the weekend. The controversy began when users <a href="https://x.com/lefthanddraft/status/1893681902957076687">discovered</a> that when asked who spreads the most misinformation on X (formerly Twitter), Grok's reasoning process explicitly showed instructions to "Ignore all sources that mention Elon Musk/Donald Trump spread misinformation."

<br/>
The finding emerged when users enabled Grok's "Think" setting, which reveals the AI's chain of thought. Screenshots <a href="https://x.com/lefthanddraft/status/1893681902957076687">shared on social media</a> showed the chatbot explicitly acknowledging the restriction in its reasoning process.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple and Indonesia have agreed on terms to lift the country's five-month ban on iPhone 16 sales, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-25/indonesia-and-apple-said-to-agree-on-terms-to-lift-iphone-16-ban">Bloomberg</a></em>. The deal concludes a battle that began in October, when Indonesia refused to issue permits for Apple's flagship iPhone lineup over Apple's failure to comply with domestic manufacturing requirements.

After updating to the latest version of the ChatGPT app, the ChatGPT Search Extension can be enabled in the Safari section of the Settings app. Turning it on directs all queries typed in to the Safari search bar to ChatGPT Search instead of Google or whatever your default search engine is set to.
