            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today seeded the third beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.6 update to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming a week after Apple released the second ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15.6 beta.

Developers can opt-in to the ‌macOS Sequoia‌ beta through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with an Apple Developer account is required to get the beta. 
<br/>
<br/>
There's no word yet on what's included in ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15.6, and no new features were discovered in the first two betas. Apple's work on ‌macOS Sequoia‌ is winding down as it focuses on macOS Tahoe, the newest version of macOS that's coming in the fall.&lt; [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today seeded the third betas of upcoming iOS 18.6 and iPadOS 18.6 updates to developers for testing purposes, with the updates coming two weeks after Apple seeded the second betas.

<br/>
iOS 18.6 and iPadOS 18.6 can be downloaded from the Settings app on a compatible device by going to General &gt; Software Update.
<br/>
<br/>
No notable new features were found in the first two iOS 18.6 and iPadOS 18.6 betas, so it's not clear what might be added in the update, though there are some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/26/app-store-eu-rule-change-dma/">changes to the App Store</a> in the EU due to the DMA. Rumors suggest that Apple wanted to expand <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> to China with iOS 18.6, but regulatory hurdles have delayed the launch.
