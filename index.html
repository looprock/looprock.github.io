            Apple's latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models feature a second-generation Ceramic Shield material, which Apple says is even tougher than the prior-generation Ceramic Shield. Device insurance provider Allstate Protection Plans today published the results of its annual device drop test, giving us insight into the durability of the new iPhones.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Allstate tested the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> Max, which is Apple's largest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to date at 6.9 inches.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Back in May, Sonos launched a new version of its mobile app, and it's been wildly unpopular with Sonos customers because of ongoing bugs and the removal of several features. Today, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-09-23/how-sonos-botched-an-app-and-infuriated-its-customers"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> delved into what went wrong at Sonos ahead of when the app launched, and why it came out anyway.

Sonos had to come out with a new app when it launched the Sonos Ace headphones because of "technical debt."

            In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, Apple requires users to regularly reauthorize permissions for screen recording apps, a change that has not been popular with some Mac app users. During the beta testing process, these reminders came up weekly, but later in the beta, Apple changed those reminders to monthly.

            Apple today stopped signing iOS 17.6.1 and iPadOS 17.6.1 for all devices except the latest-generation iPad Pro models with the M4 chip.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Apple routinely stops signing older iOS releases over time in order to prevent users from downgrading to an outdated software version. iOS 17.6.1 no longer being signed comes one week after Apple released iOS 18 to the public.
<br/>
<br/>
iPadOS 17.6.1 is likely still signed for iPad Pro models with the M4 chip only because <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/20/apple-working-to-fix-ipados-18-m4-ipad-pro-issue/">iPadOS 18 has been temporary pulled for those devices</a>.

            With macOS 15.1 and iOS 18.1 beta 5, Apple has enabled drag and drop, a much anticipated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Mirroring feature. After updating to the new software, you can drag files from an ‌iPhone‌ to a Mac and vice versa.

            With the fifth beta of iOS 18.1, Apple has made a small tweak to the Camera Control button that was introduced on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a>, and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max.

<br/>
When you dig into the Camera Control settings, there is now a way to set it to the front-facing camera without having to interact with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s display.
<br/>
<br/>
To get to the selfie camera, open up the Camera app with a press on the Camera Control button, and then use a swipe gesture on the button to scroll through the lenses. The person icon at the very top swaps to the front-facing selfie camera.
