Jobs convinced Cook to join Apple in 1998, to help turn around the company:<blockquote>I'll never forget that first conversation with Steve. At the time, Apple had been struggling and Steve was working to right a ship that had drifted in his absence. Many people doubted the company could survive, and I was warned that accepting a job there would come with risks. But when Steve spoke, any trepidation I harbored instantly dissolved. I had never met someone with so much passion and vision.

            Apple co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, so today would have marked his 71st birthday if he hadn't passed away in 2011 at the age of 56.

            <p>Most organizations treat infrastructure as a series of projects to be &ldquo;completed,&rdquo; but successful platform engineering requires a permanent product mindset. In this episode, we explore why platform teams need dedicated product management to balance competing priorities—like security, cost, and developer experience—and why the &ldquo;why&rdquo; scales much better than the &ldquo;what&rdquo; in large enterprises. We also dive into the often-overlooked role of designers in creating platform tools that developers actually want to use.</p>
