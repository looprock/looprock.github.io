            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple in iOS 18.4 has introduced a potentially privacy-compromising change to Safari that puts your search history on full display when opening new tabs.

<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991973" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/ios-18-4-safari-search.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
Previously in iOS, opening a new tab and tapping the search field brought up the keyboard while continuing to display the personalized Safari home page. However, Apple's latest iOS 18.4 software update modifies how Safari handles new tabs by automatically showing your recent search history whenever someone taps into the search field. 
<br/>
<br/>
Privacy-conscious users are likely to raise eyebrows at the change, as it could expose previous searches in situations where users hand their devices to friends, family members, or colleagues – or just search for something when someone else is looking at their screen. A quick tap on the search field would immediately reveal  [...]<br>
