            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is overtly teasing the start of "a new era" and the ability to "code new worlds" at WWDC this year, building anticipation around the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/15/kuo-apple-well-prepared-headset-unveiling/">widely expected</a> announcement of its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ar-vr/">mixed-reality headset</a>.

<br/>
A tweet shared by Apple earlier today made the "new era" remark, seemingly leaning into the high expectations surrounding next week's WWDC keynote. The launch of a major new device and operating system, something that has not occurred since the debut of the original Apple Watch in September 2014, would certainly seem to justify the start of a new era for the company.

Multiple factors cause organizations to overshoot their budgets for public cloud services (see Figure 2). The need to scale up resources to address unexpected demand emerges as the chief culprit for cloud budget overruns (cited by 29% of respondents, up from 22% in 2021).

Unfortunately, AR/VR display specs used in headsets from competitors like Sony and Meta aren't generally advertised beyond resolution and pixels per inch, so it's diffic [...]<br>

            A young shepherd, who had been told in his spare time to watch the doings of the Sacred Beetle, came to me in high spirits, one Sunday, in the second half of June, to say that he thought the time had come to commence a search. He had detected the insect issuing from the ground, had dug at the spot where it made its appearance and had found, at no great depth, the queer thing which he was bringing me.
Queer it was and calculated to upset the little which I thought I knew. In shape, it was exactly like a tiny pear that had lost all the colour of its freshness and turned brown in rotting. What could this curious object be, this pretty plaything that seemed to come from a turner’s workshop? Was it made by human hands? Was it a model of the fruit of the pear-tree intended for some child’s collection? One would say so.<br>

<br/>
In iOS, many apps display a different view when you rotate your iPhone from portrait to landscape orientation. Depending on the app and the way you use it, this behavior isn't always desirable, which is why Apple includes the Orientation Lock option in Control Center. 
<br/>
<br/>
However, certain apps work more usefully with Orientation Lock disabled – think YouTube or the Photos app, where rotating your device to landscape orientation makes for a better fullscreen viewing experience. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you tend to keep the lock on, you have to disable it in Control Center each time you open these kinds of apps to get the fullscreen experience. Then when you close the app, you have to r [...]<br>

            <p>Etsy <a href="https://www.etsy.com/news/cant-describe-what-youre-looking-for-search-with-images-instead-dupe">announced</a> the arrival of a powerful new image-based discovery tool on Etsy’s mobile apps. The ability to search by image gives buyers the opportunity to search the Etsy marketplace using their own photos as a reference. Tap the camera icon in the search bar to take a picture, and in a fraction of a second we’ll surface visually similar results from our inventory of nearly 100 million listings. Searching by image is being rapidly adopted throughout the e-commerce industry, and nowhere does it make more sense than on Etsy, where the uniqueness of our sellers’ creations can’t always be expressed easily with words. In this post we’ll give you a look at the machine-learning architecture behind our search by image feature and the work we did to evolve it.</p>
