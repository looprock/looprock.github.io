iFixit's disassembly of the Vision Pro reveals several internal components, including an array of cameras and sensors, fans, lens motors, and more. Unsurprisingly, it appears that opening and repairing the headset will be difficult.

"The EyeSight seems like a repair Achilles' heel—so many points of failure for a slightly creepy feature," said iFixit, in an email. "But we'll give Apple credit where it's due: the easily replaceable speakers and battery are big repairability wins."

Vision Pro is powered by an M2 chip with an 8-core CPU, a 10-core GPU, a 16-core Neural Engine, and 16GB of unified memory. &lt;a href=" [...]<br>

            Traveling is perhaps one of the best uses of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset, as it can be used on airplanes and has a specific Travel Mode. Apple today published several support documents that provide some important details on <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214004">traveling with the Vision Pro</a>, activating the built-in Travel Mode, and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214004">storing it</a> when it's not in use.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>

Apple says that the Developer Strap is helpful for "accelerating the development of graphics-intensive apps and games." It is designed to provide the same audio experience as the standard Right Audio Strap, so it can be used for both development and testing.

As noted by <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/02/vision-pro-developer-strap"><em>Daring Fireball</em>'s John Gruber</a>, the Developer Strap is only available to developers who are logged in to a paid U.S. Apple Developer account.
