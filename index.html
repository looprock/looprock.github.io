            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In macOS Sonoma, currently in beta, you can create individual web apps for any website that you frequent in Safari, and have them sit beside other apps in your Dock. Let's take a closer look at how it all works by turning MacRumors.com into a virtual Mac app as an example.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900324" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-web-app-MacRumors.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
In macOS Sonoma, any website viewed in Safari can be turned into a web app, thanks to a new "Add to Dock" option in the File menu. In other words, no work is required on the part of web developers to make a site web app compatible, although there are some elements of web apps that developers can have control over (see below).

            The first <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/1578788">Geekbench 6 benchmark result</a> for the new Mac Pro surfaced today, providing a closer look at the M2 Ultra chip's CPU performance in the desktop tower.

<br/>
The result lists a single-core score of 2,794 and a multi-core score of 21,453, compared to 1,378 and 10,390 for the highest-end Intel-based Mac Pro with a 28-core Xeon W processor, a configuration that started at $12,999. This means the new Mac Pro is over twice as fast as the fastest Intel-based model, and given that all configurations include the M2 Ultra chip, this performance can be had for a much lower $6,999.

Bergeron said the 15-inch MacBook Air having the same battery life as the 13-inch model is the result of "thermal control loops and software optimizations."<blockquote>There's definitely thermal control loops and software optimizations that we use.

The workloads for a typical MacBook Air owner are fairly bursty, meaning they may do something for a few minutes and then walk away from their computer and either have a background process </blockquote> [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-06-13 06:31:16-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 17 and macOS Sonoma, turning off iCloud Drive no longer impacts third-party apps that use Apple's iCloud database to sync their data, a notable change that is likely to be welcomed by both developers and users.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900104" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/icloud-drive.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
In previous versions of macOS and iOS, when iCloud Drive is manually disabled in System Settings or the Settings app, this also turns off iCloud (i.e. CloudKit) database access for third-party apps, even if they don't use an iCloud Drive folder. This is despite the fact that iCloud syncing of Apple's own stock apps remains unaffected.
<br/>
<br/>
This behavior is not made clear in Apple's user-facing settings, which confusingly include separate switches to turn iCloud on and off individually for iCloud Drive, system apps, and third-party apps.

Moreover, iCloud Drive can take a considerable amount o [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple may be forced to change the name of its new mixed reality headset in China unless it can come to an agreement with Huawei, which already owns the "Vision Pro" trademark in the country. 
<br/>

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898794" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-at-Steve-Jobs-Theater.jpeg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
Originally spotted by <em><a href="https://news.mydrivers.com/1/915/915819.htm">MyDrivers</a></em>, the trademark was originally granted to Huawei on May 16, 2019, and gives the company exclusive rights to its use in China from November 28, 2021 to November 27, 2031.
<br/>
<br/>
Huawei actively uses the trademark in China, and offers a number of products under the Vision name, including smart TVs and smart glasses. If Apple intends to sell its headset in China and call it Vision Pro, it may have to enter into negotiations with Huawei to release the trademark for a price.
