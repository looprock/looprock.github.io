Facebook will suggest photo collages, recaps, AI restyling, or themes like birthdays, graduations, and trips.

            A month before Apple introduced the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> lineup, Google debuted its new Pixel 10 smartphone line.

With Apple adopting a camera "plateau" instead of a camera bump, the camera setup for the two smartphones looks more similar than ever before. Google has used a pill-shaped multi-lens horizontal camera bar for several years now, and now Apple uses a design that's not too far off. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a>'s camera bump is wider, more square shaped, and it still has all three lenses on the left side, while Google's bar has rounded corners and lenses positioned in a row.

Apple quietly updated its online store following the launch of the M5 ‌MacBook Pro‌ to note that customers in the UK and EU who purchase the new 14-inch model will no longer receive a charging brick by default. The laptop still includes a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> 3 cable, but buyers must purchase a compatible USB-C power adapter separately. The change does not apply to other markets such as the United States, where a 70W USB-C  [...]<br>

<br/>
Demand for the ‌iPhone Air‌ reportedly surged immediately after pre-orders opened.
