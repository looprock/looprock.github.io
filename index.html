            <b>Published:</b> 2025-07-15 08:31:15-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's forthcoming iPhone 17 models are likely to support up to 25W wireless charging using a variety of third-party MagSafe charging accessories, thanks to compatibility with the next-generation Qi 2.2 wireless charging standard.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1008884" height="1405" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iPhone-17-Pro-Lower-Logo-Magsafe.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Currently, iPhones featuring MagSafe use Qi 2, the Wireless Power Consortium's (WPC) widely supported second-generation charging standard. With third-party chargers, Qi 2 maxes out at 15W – although iPhone 16 models do support upgraded <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/iphone-16-25w-magsafe-charging/">25W MagSafe charging using an official 30W Apple charger</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
That limitation is likely to change with the iPhone 17 models, which are expected to support Qi 2.2, based on &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/05/iphone-17-support-50w-magsafe-wireless-ch [...]<br>

            Samsung Display will supply Apple with "crease-free" displays for its long-rumored foldable iPhone, according to <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/acBH2tItErAhI2">Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-995585" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Foldable-iPhone-2023-Feature-Homescreen.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
To achieve a crease-free inner display, Kuo said the foldable iPhone will utilize a metal plate that can disperse and control the stress generated by bending the display. The metal plates will be primarily supplied by a company named Fine M-Tec, he said.

Samsung's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/samsung-galaxy-z-fold7/">new Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> still has a visible crease in the middle of its inner screen, so it seems like Samsung Display would have to be developing a custom solution for Apple in order for the foldable iPhone to truly have a "crease-free" design.

Notably absent from this list is the widely discussed digital services tax, which had been under consideration as recently as May. The tax was framed as a tool to ensure that large digital companies contribute fairly to the European economy.

            Originally published in 2019, this article is part two of a three-part series exploring Go’s garbage collector. Though the Go runtime has continued to evolve, the performance principles covered here remain highly relevant today. This installment focuses on practical techniques for analyzing and reducing garbage collection (GC) overhead in real-world Go applications. It walks through how to interpret GC traces using GODEBUG=gctrace=1 and uncover allocation hotspots with pprof, with a clear message: reducing unnecessary allocations, especially in tight loops, has a direct and measurable impact on latency and throughput.<br>
