            <b>Published:</b> 2024-01-11 07:15:46-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Microsoft today overtook Apple as the world's most valuable public company by market value. Apple's share price dropped by just one percent, enabling Microsoft to narrowly pull ahead of Apple at a value of $2.87 trillion.

<br/>
Microsoft has briefly overtaken Apple as the most valuable company since 2018, most recently in 2020 and 2021 when concerns about supply chain shortages dented Apple's stock price and a boom in remote working bolstered Microsoft. Over the past year, Microsoft's support for artificial intelligence tools by backing OpenAI has helped boost its value, while equivalent offerings from Apple have been noticeably absent.

            Apple today received approval to sell the HomePod mini in Malaysia, according to a local regulatory filing <a href="https://twitter.com/XavierNaxa/status/1745442408656179388">uncovered by Xavier Naxa</a>.

<br/>
It's unclear when the HomePod mini will be available in Malaysia, but sales will presumably begin on Apple's online store there within the next few months. Apple has yet to receive approval to sell the full-size second-generation HomePod in the country.

<br/>
Apple first released the HomePod mini in October 2020 in the U.S., and it is now sold in around 25 countries. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/homepod-mini-new-colors/">New color options</a> were added in November 2021, and the speaker's previously-unused temperature and humidity sensor was &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/hom [...]<br>
