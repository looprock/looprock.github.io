<p>The idea is that once data is stored, other data, for efficiency purposes, ideally should be stored near it.  As the amount of data grows, it becomes almost necessary for other data to be stored near it. 
The "gravity" concept is that large amounts of data attract other data to be near it.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Vision Pro headset that Apple plans to release next year has displays that support up to a 100Hz refresh rate, according to code in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-releases-visionos-beta-4/">latest beta of visionOS</a>.

<br/>
Apple says that the Vision Pro headset runs at a 90Hz refresh rate most of the time, but in an online WWDC session, the company revealed that it is also able to switch to 96Hz to support video content filmed at 24 frames per second.
<br/>
<br/>
Code <a href="https://twitter.com/M1Astra/status/1709429656829534557">found by M1 Astra</a> confirms that the actual maximum Vision Pro refresh rate is 100Hz, but 100Hz is a mode that only activates to "compensate for detected 50Hz flicker from artificial lighting."

The drop and dunk tests included the $1,200 ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max, the $1,200 Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, the $1,799 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold5, and the $1,799 Google Pixel Fold. These are the most expensive smartphone options from Apple, Google, and Samsung, and all of these phones are constructed from glass.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Samsung today joined Google in attempting to convince Apple to adopt the Rich Communication Services or RCS messaging standard that Google has been pushing.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
In a short ad that's a riff on Romeo and Juliet, Samsung features two smartphone interfaces texting each other. "Juliet" is the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> in the metaphor and her parents (aka Apple) won't allow for the adoption of RCS. "What did green ever do to them? We're bubbles too," laments the "Romeo" Android smartphone. "And literally everyone wants us to be together. Ugh," writes Juliet.
<br/>
<br/>
It's ultimately a bit of a confusing ad, but Samsung makes it clear with the title of the video: "Green bubbles and blue bubbles want to be together." Samsung also includes the "Help Apple #GetTheMessage" tagline and hashtag that Google has been using for its RCS campaign.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touchscreen-mac/">Touchscreen Mac</a> rumors are not new, but it turns out that neither are touchscreen Macs. In 1999, a company called Elo produced and sold touchscreen versions of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> G3 through Apple's Value Added Reseller program for use as kiosk machines, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZGswRH4wbM">YouTuber Michael MJD</a> recently managed to get hold of one.

<br/>
The "ready-to-go tabletop kiosks" featured Elo's own iTouch touch-on-tube interface, which used surface acoustic waves instead of an overlay to detect where users touched the screen. You can see a prototype Elo ‌iMac‌ in action in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZGswRH4wbM">Michael MJD's video</a>, which also covers the history of the machine as well as its technical specifications. Given the simplicity of the hardware modification, it's a pretty impressive feat.
