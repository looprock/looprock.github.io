            Apple's iOS 18 brings a significant redesign to the Photos app, introducing a unified Library View that consolidates all sections into a single, scrollable interface. While this new layout <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-navigating-redesigned-photos-app/">aims to streamline navigation</a>, you may want to tailor it to your preferences. Here's how you can customize and reorder collections in the new Photos app.

<br/>
The ‌Apple Card‌ savings account's annual percentage yield (APY) dropped from 4.4% to 4.25%, in line with the US Federal Reserve approving an aggressive rate cut of 50 basis points last week. Push notifications regarding the cut were sent to ‌Apple Card‌ users on Tuesday evening.

When the ‌Apple Card‌'s savings account first became available, it offered an APY of 4.15%. The rate then increased three times, first to 4.25%, then to 4.35%, and finally to 4.5%, before being lowered to 4.4% in April 2024.

            Apple's latest iPhone 16 models include a new Camera Control button (located on the lower right-hand side when holding the phone in portrait mode).

Within the Camera app, a light press on the button engages a haptic click that also allows for adjusting things like manual exposure and zoom, thanks to a handy sliding interface that operates similarly to a camera dial. This gesture also reveals a clean preview of the scene you'r [...]<br>

Across the <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2-homepod-minis-bricked-with-os-18-1-beta-5.2437870/">MacRumors Forums</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Earth2075/status/1838336848051015944">X</a>, some users complained that installing this beta on their HomePod mini resulted in the speaker going into a "bricked" state, meaning that it no longer functioned. A few users said they were eventually able to restore the HomePod mini using the Apple Configurator app on a Mac.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-09-23 16:22:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Back in May, Sonos launched a new version of its mobile app, and it's been wildly unpopular with Sonos customers because of ongoing bugs and the removal of several features. Today, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-09-23/how-sonos-botched-an-app-and-infuriated-its-customers"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> delved into what went wrong at Sonos ahead of when the app launched, and why it came out anyway.

<br/>
Sonos had to come out with a new app when it launched the Sonos Ace headphones because of "technical debt." The company basically spent time working on new features instead of updating outdated code written in obsolete languages, leading to infrastructure issues. Sonos put off addressing the underlying technical debt, but introducing the headphones required the Sonos app and the cloud setup behind it to be overh [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-09-23 15:34:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, Apple requires users to regularly reauthorize permissions for screen recording apps, a change that has not been popular with some Mac app users. During the beta testing process, these reminders came up weekly, but later in the beta, Apple changed those reminders to monthly.

If you're someone who prefers not to get these reminders for screen recording apps at all, you can <a href="https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/amnesia">use the Amnesia app</a> for the Mac to get rid of them. The app basically changes the .plist file for the screen capture app access feature, and it's a pay what you want situation.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-09-23 15:09:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today stopped signing iOS 17.6.1 and iPadOS 17.6.1 for all devices except the latest-generation iPad Pro models with the M4 chip.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960873" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iOS-17.6.1-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Apple routinely stops signing older iOS releases over time in order to prevent users from downgrading to an outdated software version. iOS 17.6.1 no longer being signed comes one week after Apple released iOS 18 to the public.
<br/>
<br/>
iPadOS 17.6.1 is likely still signed for iPad Pro models with the M4 chip only because <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/20/apple-working-to-fix-ipados-18-m4-ipad-pro-issue/">iPadOS 18 has been temporary pulled for those devices</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
If you still want to downgrade your iPhone to iOS 17, time is running out, with only iOS 17.7 remaining signed for the iPhone at this time. <div class="linkback">Related Forums: &lt;a href="https://forum</div> [...]<br>

This applies to items spanning a range of categories, including gaming peripherals, laptops, 4K TVs, phones, PC accessories, and more. </p>
