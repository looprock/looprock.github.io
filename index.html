The DoJ wants Google to divest its Chrome browser, refrain from making search engine agreements like the one Google <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/doj-google-chrome-sale/">has with Apple</a>, and share "critical portions" of its search data with competitors at a "marginal cost," including how it ranks search results and query understanding information.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In Safari on iPhone, it's not unusual for the number of tabs you have open to quickly get out of hand. Here's how to temporarily clean things up without losing your tabs.

            Apple is preparing to launch a dramatically thinner iPhone this September, and if recent leaks are anything to go by, the so-called iPhone 17 Air could boast one of the most radical design shifts in recent years.

<br/>
Deployed late last week, the update made ChatGPT excessively agreeable and unnaturally effusive in its praise, and the responses quickly became the subject of mockery on social media.
<br/>
<br/>
CEO Sam Altman announced Tuesday that the company had completed the rollback for free users and was working to restore the previous version for paid subscribers. "We're working on additional fixes to model personality and will share more in the coming days," Altman wrote on <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1917291637962858735">X (Twitter)</a>.

The company's Apple Music division will now be co-managed by longtime Apple executive Rachel Newman and former TikTok music veteran Ole Obermann. Both will report to Oliver Schusser, who has taken on additional responsibilities over the past year including Apple TV+ and sports initiatives.
<br/>
<br/>
The restructuring appears designed to ease Schusser's workload as he continues to oversee the Beats brand and international services while reporting to Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of online services.
