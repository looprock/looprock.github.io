Nvidia is expected to overtake Apple as the single largest source of revenue for TSMC. Analyst estimates suggest Nvidia will generate approximately $33 billion in revenue for TSMC during 2026, representing roughly 22% of the foundry's total revenue, compared with an estimated $27 billion, or about 18%, attributable to Apple. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang reportedly confirmed on a recent podcast that the transition has already occurred, saying that Nvidia is now TSMC's largest customer.

            Apple's rumored new variable aperture camera system for this year's iPhone 18 Pro models has reached the sampling stage, according to a new claim from a Chinese leaker.

<br/>
Posting on Weibo today, the account known as "<a href="https://weibo.com/5888095979/QpcATha7l">Smart Pikachu</a>" said the feature had entered late-stage engineering samples, while a teleconverter is also "under evaluation" for the device. The iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max are expected to launch in September 2026.
<br/>
<br/>
A variable aperture on the iPhone 18 Pro could improve exposure control, particularly for video. By reducing light optically, it could help maintain natural motion blur and smoother exposure in bright conditions.

<p>AI is still stuck in “efficiency mode.” In many organizations, a technology organization leads AI efforts and is treated as a cost center.

That leadership gap bleeds over into the measurement of AI value.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Kubernetes memory limits introduce a subtle but critical interaction with the Go runtime that can determine whether a service runs efficiently or fails under load. This article explores how Go manages memory under normal conditions and what changes when Kubernetes enforces hard memory constraints. Using controlled load testing, it shows why Go is generally excellent at self regulating memory, how OOM events emerge once limits are imposed, and how tools like GOMEMLIMIT can be used to align the runtime with container boundaries. Originally published in July 2024, the guidance remains highly relevant for teams running Go services in containerized environments where stability and throughput are tightly coupled to memory configuration.</p><br>
