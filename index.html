In a research note today with investment firm GF Securities, Pu shared a chart in which he reiterated that the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will each be equipped with a 24-megapixel front camera. By comparison, all four iPhone 16 models are equipped with a 12-megapixel front camera.

Another analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo, also claimed that at least one iPhone 17 model <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/kuo-iphone-17-to-feature-24mp-front-facing-camera/">would be equipped with a 24-megapixel front camera</a>, so this upgrade has been rumored by multiple sources.

            Apple is opening a revamped store this weekend at Crocker Park, an outdoor shopping center in the Cleveland suburb Westlake, Ohio.

The new store opens on Saturday, March 22 at 10 a.m. local time, <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/crockerpark/">according to Apple's website</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple's new store at Crocker Park will be larger and more modern than its original store at the shopping center, which first opened in 2008. At many of Apple's newer stores, there is an Apple Pickup station where customers can collect online orders, along with a Genius Bar with counters set at varied heights for improved accessibility.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Powerful multi-port power banks are becoming increasingly popular to keep our ever-growing array of gadgets charged up, and Alogic's new <a href="https://alogic.co/products/ark-pro-27-600mah-power-bank-with-160w-usb-charging?ref=y2uwzwu">Ark Pro power bank</a> brings some nice versatility to the table.

<br/>
I've spent a few weeks testing out the Ark Pro, and I've found that it packs a nice punch with 27,600 mAh of juice and a trio of USB ports and the ability to charge a laptop at up to 140 watts.
<br/>
<br/>
You'll find a lot of beefy power banks coming in at around this same mAh rating, and that's because 27,600 mAh translates to 99.36 Wh in this battery, which is just under the 100 Wh limit for carrying it on an airplane without needing to get approval from the airline.

Apple's website says the extra trade-in credit for Macs is available with the purchase of an eligible new Apple device through April 2, yet the values listed have already decreased before that date, which is something the average customer likely wouldn't realize.

As of February 9, the listed trade-in values had increased by between $10 and $50 in the U.S., but some of the values have already decreased since then.
