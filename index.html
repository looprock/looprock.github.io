Apple's contract with Google, which ensures that Google's search engine is the default on Apple's Safari browser, has been a significant source of revenue. In 2022, the arrangement reportedly netted Apple over $20 billion, an amount derived from 36 percent of the ad revenue generated by searches on Safari, as revealed in court documents.

The agreement has substantial financial implications for both companies. For Apple, the payments from Google constitute an important revenue stream as a significant proportion of its prof [...]<br>

            In 2025, Apple is expected to discontinue the iPhone "Plus" device in its iPhone 17 lineup to make way for an iPhone "Slim" – although it may not actually be called this when it debuts in the fall of next year. Even though the iPhone 16 series launch is still over two months away, when you consider that we learned about larger displays on the iPhone 16 Pro models way back in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/">May 2023</a>, rumors about a two-generations-away iPhone isn't all that unusual so far ahead of time.

The U.S. messaging giant confirmed this week that "threat actors" gained access to its servers, resulting in the theft of users' phone numbers, but it did not specify how many were accessed.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            OpenAI has issued an update to its <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt/mac/">ChatGPT app for Mac</a>, after a developer discovered the app was locally storing users' conversations with the chatbot in plain text.

Pedro José Pereira Vieito told <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/3/24191636/openai-chatgpt-mac-app-conversations-plain-text">The Verge</a></em>'s Jay Peters: "I was curious about why OpenAI opted out of using the app sandbox protections and ended up checking where they stored the app data." 
<br/>
<br/>
That led Pereira Vieito to develop "ChatGPTStealer," a simple app to <a href="https://www.threads.net/@pvieito/post/C85NVV6hvF6?xmt=AQGz0o3JtBOwk1nfUgk8lvxQoIV8E92xz1vK1IP8VC6zhA">demonstrate</a> how easy it is to load the chats in a text window outside of the ChatGPT app. After successfully trying out the [...]<br>
