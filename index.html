            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            A federal jury Friday ruled that Masimo's smartwatches infringed on Apple Watch patents, but awarded Apple just $250 in damages, which is the statuary minimum amount Apple could seek while it pursues a jury trial rather than a court trial over Masimo's alleged infringements.

According to <em><a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/apple-wins-250-in-mixed-jury-verdict-over-smartwatch-patents">Bloomberg Law</a></em>, jurors found that the original design for Masimo's W1 Freedom and health module, plus its charger, willfully infringed on Apple design patents.

<br/>
"Jelly scrolling" refers to screen tearing, which can cause text or images on one side of the screen to appear to be tilted downwards because of a mismatch in refresh rates. It can cause one side of the display to look as if it is responding faster than the other side, resulting in a visual disturbance that is hard to ignore once noticed.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-10-25 06:08:38-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's marketing chief Greg Joswiak on Thursday <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/24/apple-m4-announcements-next-week/">teased an "exciting week of announcements"</a> planned next week, and that likely rules out a prerecorded Apple Event video this month, despite Apple streaming a short, spooky "Scary Fast" event last October.

<br/>
Nevertheless, YouTube channel Front Page Tech has stepped in with its own rendition of the Apple Event we aren't getting this month. In the video, Jon Prosser does his best impression of Apple CEO Tim Cook and announces all of the rumored new Macs with M4 chips. The video is somewhat of a parody, so don't take it too seriously, but it's also an impressive production feat that Prosser's team spent nearly a month working on.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            From business meetings to family memories, there are countless reasons to record a phone call, but until now, iPhone users have had to rely on third-party apps or complex workarounds. That changes on October 28 with the release of iOS 18.1, which introduces native call recording and transcription powered by Apple Intelligence.

<br/>
Apple's new Phone app feature not only records conversations but automatically creates searchable transcripts and AI-generated summaries, all while maintaining Apple's commitment to privacy and transparency. When you start recording, all participants automatically hear an announcement, ensuring everyone knows they're being recorded. A visible indicator also remains on screen throughout the call for as long as the recording continues.

In this episode, we explore how Rust’s ownership and borrowing rules impact multithreaded programming, focusing on the complexities of managing memory in a concurrent environment. We’ll break down how Rust&rsquo;s strict borrowing and ownership model ensures safety and prevents common pitfalls like data races and undefined behavior, making it an ideal choice for building reliable multithreaded applications.

<br/>
Apple products discontinued this year include the iPad 9, SuperDrive, FineWoven cases for the iPhone, and the Powerbeats Pro earbuds.
<br/>
<br/>
This list <strong>excludes most previous-generation devices</strong> that were discontinued this year as part of annual updates to Apple's product lineup, such as the iPhone 15 Pro and Apple Watch Series 9. The one exception to this rule is the iPad 9, as that device was discontinued in May, over a year and a half after the iPad 10 launched.
