            With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.2 beta, Apple has revamped <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a>, adding new options for sharing a more limited amount of information on the screen when AirPlaying to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>.

<br/>
There are now options to show your entire screen, a specific window or app, or your extended display. Limiting ‌AirPlay‌ to a specific app allows a presentation or photos to be shared on the larger screen of a TV without allowing viewers to see all of the content on a Mac.
<br/>
<br/>
In the current version of macOS, Apple allows for mirroring a Mac's display to an ‌Apple TV‌, but there is no option for sharing just a portion of a display.

The investigation centers on concerns that US-based Corning may have abused its market position by adopting exclusivity contracts to prevent rival glass makers from competing for business with mobile device manufacturers.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple and Masimo are back in a California court this week for a bench trial that will see Masimo arguing that Apple illegally poached its employees and stole trade secrets when developing the Apple Watch.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Masimo first filed the trade secret lawsuit against Apple in 2020, and there was a jury trial in April 2023. During that trial, the court threw out more than half of Masimo's trade secret claims, but the judge ultimately declared a mistrial because the jury was not able to come to a final decision. Six of seven jurors sided with Apple, while one Masimo holdout would not change her opinion.

Apple and Masimo were slated to retry the case with another jury, but Masimo abandoned all claims asking for monetary compensation in order to get a bench trial instead. Masimo originally requested $1.85 billion in da [...]<br>

            The first developer beta of visionOS 2.2 came out yesterday, and it includes a much anticipated new feature for Vision Pro users. When using the Vision Pro as a display for a Mac, there are now options to use wide and ultrawide layouts in addition to the standard virtual display.

We thought we'd check out the new display settings for those who might be interested in seeing how this changes the Vision Pro Mac workflow.

With the wide display option, there's enough screen real estate to use four apps at once without compromising on window size. Ultrawide bumps up the available space even more, and it's almost too much display space.

As of late September, Apple had approximately 164,000 full-time employees worldwide, the company disclosed <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000320193/c87043b9-5d89-4717-9f49-c4f9663d0061.pdf">in a filing</a> last week. That's up from the 161,000 full-time employees that Apple reported a year ago. These figures include corporate employees, such as software engineers, and retail employees at its stores.

Apple now has as many employees as it did in 2022, following a slight decrease last year.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>I wrote a blog post a couple of weeks ago entitled <a href="https://rhaas.blogspot.com/2024/10/is-pgdump-backup-tool.html" target="_blank">Is pg_dump a Backup Tool?</a>. In that post, I argued in the affirmative, but also said that it's probably shouldn't be your primary backup mechanism. For that, you probably shouldn't directly use anything that is included in PostgreSQL itself, but rather a well-maintained third-party backup tool such as <a href="https://pgbarman.org/" target="_blank">barman</a> or <a href="https://pgbackrest.org/" target="_blank">pgbackrest</a>.
