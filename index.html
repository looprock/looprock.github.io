            <b>Published:</b> 2024-07-24 04:06:13-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iPhone will adopt a new 1/2.6-inch 48MP Ultra Wide CMOS image sensor (CIS) made by Samsung as early as 2026, breaking Sony's years-long monopoly as Apple's CIS supplier, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

<br/>
Writing in a brief report <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1816057976358330824">published on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Kuo said Samsung has already established a dedicated team within its ranks to work on the camera components with a view to specifically supplying Apple. 
<br/>
<br/>
For years now, Apple has exclusively sourced CIS for its iPhones from Sony. However, recent developments suggest a strategic shift away from the Japanese supplier due to concerns about reliability and Apple's need to integrate new technologies into its camera system.

The mechanical system would allow users to adjust the size of the iPhone 17's aperture, which refers to the opening of the camera lens through which light enters.
