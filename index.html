            Apple this week discontinued the 13-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> MacBook Pro, replacing it with a 14-inch model that's equipped with a next-generation M3 chip. The 14-inch model is more expensive, but it comes with a number of benefits that make it worth the upgrade for anyone with a 13-inch machine.

The 14-inch MacBook Pro has a larger display than the 13-inch model for more screen real estate, and it features much more modern-looking thin bezels. There's also a notch that houses the front-facing camera, a necessity for those slimmed down bezels. It is a mini-LED Liquid Retina XDR display, which is an upgrade over the LCD of the prior-generation 13-inch model.

<br/>
Based on the results so far, the M3 chip has single-core and multi-core scores of around 3,000 and 11,700, respectively. The standard M2 chip has single-core and multi-core scores of around 2,600 and 9,700, respectively, so the M3 chip is up to 20% faster than the M2 chip, as Apple claimed during its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/">"Scary Fast" event</a> on Monday.
<br/>
<br/>
Geekbench 6 multi-core scores:<ul><li><strong>M3 chip:</strong> ~11,700 (+20% vs. M2 chip)</li>

            <p>While Postgres excels at supporting many workloads, including modern ones, there are still some workloads it cannot handle.  Two areas that Postgres is currently unable to handle involve large data
volumes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Data sets which are so large that they cannot be efficiently processed by a single server
  </li><li>Write-heavy workloads that cannot be efficiently written by a single server
</li></ul>
<p>Postgres is a great general-purpose database, and it might be fine if Postgres were deemed unacceptable for such workloads, especially if supporting such workloads required a major redesign of Postgres. 
However, could Postgres be modified incrementally to support such workloads?  This is what the Postgres development community has been working on since

The battle to end the trademark registrations for &#8220;Taco Tuesday&#8221; began years and years ago, mostly after Taco John&#8217;s wielded the trademark haphazardly to occasionally threaten other taco joints with legal action.

            The upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models may be equipped with an extra button, according to <a href="https://weibo.com/u/5143897135">Weibo leaker Instant Digital</a>, who has shared accurate details on Apple's plans in the past. Instant Digital claims that there is a "great chance" of getting an additional button, with Apple also planning to relocate the mmWave antenna to the left of the device instead of the right to accommodate the change.

The ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro Action Button will supposedly sit flush with the device, as Apple is expected to transition to solid-state technology for the button rather than the current standard button design.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-10-31 13:29:40-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today seeded the fifth beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, the software that runs on the Vision Pro headset. The fourth beta <a href="">came out in early October</a>, so it has been nearly a month since Apple last released a ‌visionOS‌ update.

<br/>
Only a limited number of developers have access to Vision Pro at this time, with the headsets used for app testing purposes. Most people do not have access to the ‌visionOS‌ beta outside of Xcode, and it is not entirely clear what Apple is adding in each ‌visionOS‌ update. Apple has said that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> will be coming to ‌visionOS‌ soon, and it appears that it may be present in this fifth beta.
