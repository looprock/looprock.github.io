            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, Apple has introduced several new features for its Messages app, and this one in particular is long overdue. The ability to create polls in conversations has been a mainstay of rival messaging platforms. And now, Messages finally has it too.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004974" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/iOS-26-Messages-Polls.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
You can add up to 12 choices in a poll, and then send it to people in a conversation to vote on. If you send a poll and someone thinks an option is missing, they can even edit it and add in another choice.
<br/>
<br/>
For chats where you want to ask people to choose one of multiple options, you can create a poll in the following way: 
<br/>
<ol>
<br/>
<li>Tap the <strong>+</strong> button next to the message input field.</li>
<br/>
<li>Select <strong>Polls</strong> in the vertical list.</li>
<br/>
<li>Fill in your poll's choices (you can have up to 12).</li>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-23 03:21:29-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple for its 20th anniversary iPhone will adopt a Samsung-made OLED technology called COE (Color Filter on Encapsulation) to make the display brighter and thinner than previous panels, reports <em><a href="https://www.etnews.com/20250919000194">ETNews</a></em>.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1001660" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/All-Screen-iPhone-2027-Feature-1.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
In a traditional OLED panel, a polarizing film sits above the display to cut reflections and improve contrast. The drawback is that this film also absorbs some of the OLED's own light, reducing brightness and efficiency. With COE, Apple would remove the polarizer entirely and instead apply the color filter directly onto the OLED's protective encapsulation layer.
<br/>
<br/>
The result would be a thinner display stack that lets more light through, delivering higher brightness without requiring more power. Removing layers would also mean less thicknes [...]<br>
