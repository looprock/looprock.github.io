            A little more than three months ago, <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613">Aaron Perris</a> discovered references to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/ios-26-all-the-little-changes/">unreleased "Weather via satellite" feature</a> in the code for the first iOS 26 developer beta. However, just one day before iOS 26 is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/14/ios-26-available-tomorrow/">set to be widely released</a>, the feature has yet to be released or even announced by Apple.

The references have not been removed from the code, as of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/apple-seeds-ios-26-rc/">iOS 26 Release Candidate</a>, so it is possible that Apple will introduce the feature eventually.

The "Digital ID" feature is not functional in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/apple-seeds-ios-26-rc/">iOS 26 Release Candidate</a>, which is typically the final beta version, despite being listed on the <a href="https://www.apple.com/os/ios/">iOS 26 features page</a> in the present tense.

There were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/30/iphone-17-metalens-rumor/">conflicting rumors</a> about whether the iPhone 17 Pro models would have a smaller Dynamic Island, but its size did not change. Now, the rumor is back on the table for the iPhone 18 series, and there is a decent chance it will be true this time around, as it would be a stepping stone towards the rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/11/apple-iphone-air-interview/">20th-anniversary all-glass iPhone</a>.

            Five Years Ago This week in 2020, we learned about how the White House supposedly blocked Walmart from buying TikTok, and we asked why amidst all the fear around the site, nobody was equally worried about advertising tech and location data sales. GOP Senators released the latest stupid attempt to reform Section 230, the FISA [&#8230;]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In case you missed it, Apple's event this week included another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKphYoxGeRE">heartwarming video</a> about the Apple Watch's genuine life-saving potential.

<br/>
The video is titled "Dear Apple," in reference to the emails the company receives from Apple Watch customers who were alerted to health conditions, or were helped by features like Emergency SOS and Crash Detection at critical moments.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
"Real people share how Apple Watch has changed and even helped save their lives—a fitness story in New York, a teen's struggle with mental health in the UK and powerful health and safety stories from the U.S., Japan, and Canada," said Apple.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-13 10:01:46-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The latest iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and iPhone Air models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/iphone-17-n1-chip/">equipped with Apple's all-new N1 chip</a> for Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread connectivity. However, the chip has a Wi-Fi 7 bandwidth limitation.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1018100" height="898" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/apple-n1-chip.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
According to FCC documents reviewed by <em>MacRumors</em>, the N1 chip in all of the new iPhone models supports up to 160 MHz channel bandwidth for Wi-Fi 7, short of the standard's 320 MHz maximum. This limitation means the devices cannot achieve the peak theoretical speeds possible with Wi-Fi 7, but real-world performance is typically already bottlenecked by internet service providers and other factors.

For the vast majority of customers, this is a non-issue, but some iPhone users had  [...]<br>
