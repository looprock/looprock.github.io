<br/>
We have been informed that the new Mac Pro is assembled at the same Austin, Texas facility where it has been assembled since 2013, and units distributed to U.S. customers continue to include components designed, developed, and manufactured by more than a dozen American companies. Apple has not indicated why a "Product of Thailand" label was added to the Mac Pro — this fine print does not appear on the previous model.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple appears to be preparing an iOS 16.5.1 update for the iPhone, based on evidence of the software in our website's analytics logs last week. It's unclear when the update will be released, but it will likely be available either this week or next week.

<br/>
Minor updates like iOS 16.5.1 are typically focused on bug fixes, stability improvements, and security patches, rather than new features. Apple's Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/19/ios-16-5-bug-with-lightning-usb-3-camera-adapter/">does not work properly</a> with iPhones running iOS 16.5, but the issue was resolved in the iOS 16.6 beta last month, so a fix is likely to be included in iOS 16.5.1 as well.

            With the launch of the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a>, Apple has finally completed the transition to Apple silicon across the entire Mac lineup. Over the past decade, Apple has only released three new Mac Pros and the latest version starts at $6,999 – the highest starting price of any ‌Mac Pro‌ model to date – making it all the more important to consider if now is a good time to upgrade or even if an older model will suffice for your needs.

<br/>
The 15-inch MacBook Air is equipped with the same M2 chip as the 13-inch model, and the laptops share the same overall design. Apple says both models even have the same battery life. The 15-inch model's only hardware differences include a larger display/chassis and six speakers, compared to four in the 13-inch model.

The subreddit is now private, meaning that users can no longer view or submit posts, and the moderators behind the community said it will remain that way for the next 48 hours, or potentially longer if necessary.

            Apple at WWDC this week announced a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10123/">new toolkit</a> that makes it easier for game developers to port Windows games to the Mac. The toolkit provides an emulation environment that allows developers to run their existing, unmodified Windows game on the Mac and quickly evaluate how well the game could run on macOS before writing any code. A beta version of the toolkit is available for download on the Apple Developer website.

Apple is also offering developers a new Metal shader converter that simplifies the process of converting a Windows game's shaders and graphics code to run on Macs with Apple silicon. Apple says the toolkit and converter significantly reduce the total development time required to port games to the Mac, from months to just a few days.

            Apple at WWDC this week announced a new TipKit framework that will allow developers to offer tips in their apps on iOS 17, iPadOS 17, macOS Sonoma, watchOS 10, and tvOS 17. These tips can help to surface hidden features, highlight brand new features, show a faster method of accomplishing a task, and more.

<br/>
Tips may appear next to a button or other user interface element in an app at timely moments, providing contextual information about features. Of course, apps can already offer their own tips and helpful information, but Apple is now providing a native solution with a consistent design. Apple has a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10229/">WWDC session</a> with more details for developers interested in TipKit, but there is no documentation available yet.
