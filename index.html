<br/>
During the first quarter of the year, China's smartphone market experienced modest year-over-year growth of 1.5%, marking the second consecutive quarter of growth. This uptick in sales is largely attributed to strong sales performance from local manufacturers such as Huawei, which achieved a remarkable 69.7% growth compared to the same period last year. This growth was fueled by the launch of Huawei's Mate 60 series, a smartphone lineup that has significantly bolstered the company's dominance in the Chinese premium segment [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Over the weekend, Apple leaker and prototype collector Kosutami claimed that Apple has decided to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/21/apple-reportedly-stops-finewoven-production/">halt production</a> of FiveWoven accessories over durability concerns.

            Facebook parent company Meta <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/meta-horizon-os-open-hardware-ecosystem-asus-republic-gamers-lenovo-xbox/">today announced</a> the upcoming expansion of Meta Horizon OS, a virtual and augmented reality operating system that will be available to third-party hardware manufacturers that want to design their own headsets.

            The <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/products/ceiling-lights/skylight/">Nanoleaf Skylight Smarter Kit</a> is Nanoleaf's first hardwired, permanent light, and it's also the first light that Nanoleaf designed specifically to be installed on ceilings.

<br/>
As with Nanoleaf Light Panels, the Skylight is modular. A 3-panel starter kit is priced at $250, and each add-on panel is $70. Nanoleaf sells kits with more panels at a discount, so cost can go as low as $62 per panel for a design that uses 12 panels.

<br/>
Ceiling lights come in a wide range of prices and $250 is in the mid to high range, but there aren't many modular ceiling light options (as in hardwired with no visible cord), and none that I'm aware of that are both smart and offer multicolor and white lighting.

The original Beats Pill was a wireless Bluetooth speaker introduced in 2012 prior to Apple's acquisition of Beats Electronics. It received a few updates in its first several years on the market, with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2015/10/26/beats-pill-speaker-launches/">final revision being a redesigned Pill+</a> with a Lightning connector introduced under Apple's ownership in 2015.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Today marks the three-year anniversary of Apple's announcement of the 24-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, a transformative redesign featuring the first integration of Apple silicon in the product line.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Apple unveiled the new 24-inch ‌iMac‌ on April 20, 2021, almost nine years after the previous ‌iMac‌ redesign debuted. It replaced both the 21.5-inch and the 27-inch Intel iMacs, and represented a recommitment to the long-standing desktop product line.
<br/>
<br/>
The highly anticipated redesign offers a much thinner and more compact body compared to its predecessors, available in an array of vibrant colors reminiscent of the original iMacs released in the late 1990s. The 24-inch 4.5K Retina display boasts 11.3 million pixels and support for 1 billion colors.

<h2 id="m4_update">M4 Update</h2>

Apple built the M3 chip on a new 3-nanometer process, and we are not expecting a node change for the M4. It too will be a 3-nanometer chip, but Apple supplier TSMC could introduce updates that make it more efficient and faster.

New artificial intelligence capabilities are rumored for Apple's upcoming products, and so the M4 will focus on AI.
