            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <a href="https://www.swippitt.com/">Swippitt</a> has introduced an innovative charging solution at CES that aims to eliminate the need to manually plug in your iPhone. The system consists of a bread bin-style hub that automatically swaps depleted battery packs with fresh ones through specially designed phone cases.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984335" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/snippett-phone-charger.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
The Swippitt Hub houses five 3,500mAh battery packs and works with compatible cases for iPhone 14, 15, and 16 series devices. When a phone's external battery runs low, users simply insert their phone into the hub, which automatically removes the depleted battery and replaces it with a fully charged one in seconds.
<br/>
<br/>
Each battery pack provides between 50-90% additional charge depending on the iPhone model. Users can also manage charging preferences through a companion app, including options to limi [...]<br>

            LG has shown off a new <a href="https://www.ces.tech/ces-innovation-awards/2025/lg-ultrafine-6k-monitor-model-32u990a/">Ultrafine 6K monitor</a> at CES 2025. The 32-inch display is the first of its kind to support Thunderbolt 5, which Apple introduced late last year with the launch of new Mac mini and MacBook Pro models powered by M4 Pro chips.

<br/>
Details are scant, but we do know that the LG UltraFine 6K monitor (model 32U990A) features a Nano IPS Black panel, delivering a wide color gamut covering 99.5% of Adobe RGB and 98% of DCI-P3. LG has not revealed the exact resolution, but a good comparison is Apple's Pro Display XDR, whose 32-inch Retina 6K display outputs over 6016 x 3384 pixels, resulting in a pixel density of 218 pixels per inch.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Dell on Monday announced an overhaul of its PC branding strategy with a simplified naming scheme that bears a striking resemblance to Apple's iPhone nomenclature.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984319" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/dell-pro-max-pcs.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
The computer manufacturer is retiring its long-standing product names like XPS and Inspiron in favor of three straightforward tiers: Dell, Dell Pro, and Dell Pro Max – a clear copy of Apple's iPhone naming convention, which has used "Pro" and "Pro Max" to distinguish its higher-end models since the iPhone 11 was introduced in 2019.
<br/>
<br/>
The announcement reportedly raised eyebrows at Dell's press briefing ahead of CES. "Your branding sounds a lot like Apple. Aren't you just following them?" one audience member asked Dell executives, according to <em>&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-06/dell-rebrand-of-pcs-echoes-apple-naming-convention</em> [...]<br>

            Apple plans to scale up its News app by adding new countries to the platform beyond the US, Canada, the UK, and Australia, according to the <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/48685786-f0fc-43dd-8bd4-c62011af8af1">Financial Times</a></em>.

<br/>
The plans reportedly include building its locally focused news coverage in the UK, as well as bringing its puzzles section to the country which is currently limited to the US and Canada. 
<br/>
<br/>
Apple News and Apple News+, the app's free and subscription-based versions, provide a blend of curated and personalized content, including stories from magazines and newspapers, as well as games, podcasts, and newsletters. The free service makes money purely through advertising, while the subscription service costs $12.99 a month in the US and £12.99 in the UK.

            Apple plans to release at least three iOS versions before the end of April, including iOS 18.2.1, iOS 18.3, and iOS 18.4.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Below, we outline what to expect from each of these updates.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18.2.1</h2>
<br/>
<strong>Update:</strong> Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/06/apple-releases-ios-18-2-1/">released iOS 18.2.1</a> with "important bug fixes."
<br/>
<br/>
Last month, we reported that Apple has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/21/apple-preparing-ios-18-2-1/">internally testing iOS 18.2.1</a>, which is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/24/ios-18-2-1-confirmed/">expected to have a build number of 22C161</a>. The software update's presence in our analytics logs continues to ramp up, so it could be released as early as this week.
