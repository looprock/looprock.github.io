            The Notes app in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and iPadOS 18 supports colors for typed text for the first time, providing an option to add new hues to text.

<br/>
Apple offers five colors, including purple, pink, orange, mint, and blue, and there is no option for custom colors. Colors can be added to text through the formatting interface that can be accessed by tapping on the Aa button, with the shade applied to any text that is selected. Both the text and the background turn the selected color when the feature is used.

<br/>
The five color options are useful for highlighting select words and passages in text. Multiple colors can be used in the same sentence, but it is worth noting that there does not seem to be an option for colored text without the shaded background, or bla [...]<br>

Notable changes include a new "Add Songs to Queue" button at the bottom of the queue, an option to clear the entire queue all at once, and the ability to change the currently playing song without having the queue disappear. In addition, the former "Play Last" menu option has been replaced with "Add to Queue."

<br/>
Apple's stock price has split five times since the company went public, including on a 4-for-1 basis in 2020 most recently. This means that Apple's stock price would be over $45,000 today if it had never been split, and all other things being equal.

Generative AI has been a hot topic ever since ChatGPT debuted in 2022, and investors had been waiting for Apple to unveil its own plans for the technology.

            With the first beta of iOS 18 now in the hands of developers, there are a handful of smaller changes and quality-of-life improvements being discovered in Apple's iPhone software that are worth highlighting. 
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
First up, Apple has improved the flashlight controls. In iOS 18, turning on the Flashlight via the Lock Screen or Control Center now brings up a small interface that lets you adjust the flood of light from the LED. In other words, you now have granular control over not only the intensity of light, but also the breadth of illumination.

In the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-introduces-standalone-passwords-app/">new Passwords app</a>, you can generate QR codes for saved Wi-Fi passwords, allowing them to be shared more easily with others.

Less crass: be easy/instant to install and run, and have good docs that explain how to do [I&rsquo;d say 2 to 3 example apps/uses]. Even better: be a SaaS, at least have that as an option. All of this advice is pretty difficult for a full on, private cloud platform to do. You can&rsquo;t just &ldquo;install a cloud&rdquo; in a few minutes and mess around with it. Let alone, like, multi-region, etc. I think. Maybe someone could figure it out? That would actually be a good sign: if your platform is easy to install for demo&rsquo;ing, it will probably be easy to install for reals.<!-- category:link --></p><br>
