            With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple introduced a standalone Passwords app that streamlines login and password management. You've been able to store password information on your Apple devices through <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Keychain for years, but accessing passwords was a little difficult because the data was tucked away in the Settings app. That's no longer the case, and in ‌iOS 18‌, it's much simpler to create and manage passwords for websites and more.

The code refers to an unreleased Mac mini model with an Apple silicon chip and five ports, which lines up with a previous report from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman that said the next Mac mini <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/02/new-m4-mac-mini-5-usb-c-ports/">will be equipped with five USB-C ports</a>.
