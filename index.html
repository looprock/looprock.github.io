The streaming giant claims that the previous method had become unstable, leading to issues such as volume spikes during playback.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today provided developers with the third beta of iOS 18.1, and it adds Clean Up, a new Apple Intelligence tool created for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app. With Clean Up, you can remove unwanted objects from your photos, but its performance is hit or miss right now.

<br/>
When you tap into any of your photos and then tap on the edit button, you'll see a new "Clean Up" tool that has an eraser icon. Tap on that, and if there's something obvious that can be removed from the image, it'll be automatically highlighted.

<br/>
You can tap on the highlighted object to remove it, and it works like magic. If there isn't something automatically highlighted, don't worry, you can circle or scribble on any object in the photo to use Clean Up on it.
