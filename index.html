Last year, the U.S. passed a law that required Chinese company ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok due to potential national security risks, or else the platform would be banned. That law <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/tiktok-january-19-ban-imminent/">went into effect today</a>, and companies like Apple and Google risked enormous fines if they did not remove access to TikTok and other ByteDance-owned apps.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple tonight removed TikTok from the App Store in the U.S., meaning that the app can no longer be freshly installed on iPhones and iPads there. In other countries, the app remains available on the App Store and is fully functional.

<br/>
iPhone and iPad users in the U.S. who already installed TikTok can no longer use the app either as of tonight, as TikTok has made the app "temporarily unavailable."
<br/>
<br/>
In the U.S., a law banning TikTok unless Chinese company ByteDance divests its ownership of the social media platform <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/tiktok-january-19-ban-imminent/">takes effect this Sunday, January 19</a>. Lawmakers expressed concern that TikTok's ties to China pose national security risks.

Going forward, there will be a new Reels feed that includes videos that your friends have liked or commented on, so you can see what your friends have watched and what they like. Your friends will also be able to see the videos that you have liked, which is something to be aware of.

In this new Reels feed filled with friend recommendations, there will be an option to "start a conversation" with someone over a reel that they've liked.
