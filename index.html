The main task is to compare the request that our application sent to the mock. If it is different, then we need to return an error in the test. At the same time, a correct request may often have a different visual representation, so just comparing the request body with the template will not work. I compare dict or list as it's more flexible.<br>

            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup noticeably lacks a model with a display size below six inches, just two years after Apple extolled the virtues of a 5.4-inch device.

Apple debuted the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12 mini</a> in 2020 following years of calls from ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå fans for the company to offer a small-screen device with the latest features.

            During Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/everything-apple-announced-fall-2023-event/">"Wonderlust" event</a> earlier this week, Apple claimed that the ‚ÄåiPhone 15 Pro‚Äå camera system "pushes the limits of what you can capture with a smartphone." It was a reference to the device's support for "spatial computing video," but the mention was brief and lacking detail.

<br/>
For those who missed it, spatial video is Apple's name for what is essentially 3D video. The iPhone 15 Pro is able to record spatial videos natively by combining video captured by the sensors of the Main and Ultra Wide cameras, which results in something akin to stereoscopic video.
<br/>

This 3D video can then be played back using Apple's "spatial computing" Vision Pro headset when it's released early next year, allowing users to r [...]<br>
