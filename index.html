            <b>Published:</b> 2025-04-16 08:28:10-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When using macOS Finder in List view, you'll see the sizes of individual files – but not folders.
<br/>
Instead, folders show a pair of dashes (--) in the Size column. macOS skips calculating folder sizes by default to keep List view performance fast, especially in directories with many nested files. But if you want to keep an eye on folder sizes in certain locations, or even globally, there are a few ways to do it. Here's how.

<br/>
What if you want to use List view and still keep an eye on the size of a handful of folders in a specific location – in Documents, for instance, or in a directory synced to a cloud storage service? Or what if you have a super-fast SSD that can handle the pressure of calculating the size of lots of folders on the fly? Thankfully, there are several ways to make Finder show folder sizes, even in  [...]<br>

Most of the exterior of the device will continue to be aluminum, except with a "Midnight" bluish-black finish. Today's Vision Pro is only available in silver.

The ‌iPhone‌ 6s initially launched in 2015, but Apple kept it around as a low-cost device until 2018, which is why it is only now being added to the vintage list. The ‌iPhone‌ 6s had Apple's A9 chip, and it was equipped with a strengthened aluminum chassis to fix the ‌iPhone‌ 6 "bendgate" design flaw. It was also the first ‌iPhone‌ with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3d-touch/">3D Touch</a>, and the last flagship ‌iPhone&amp; [...]<br>
