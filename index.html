            Apple secretly collaborated with Chinese automaker BYD to develop long-range electric vehicle battery technology as part of its now-nixed Apple Car project, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-16/apple-secretly-worked-with-china-s-byd-on-long-range-ev-battery">Bloomberg</a></em>.

<br/>
Beginning around 2017, the partnership focused on creating a battery system using lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells. The joint effort aimed to produce batteries with longer range and improved safety compared to typical EV batteries of the time. Apple reportedly brought expertise in advanced battery packs and heat management, while BYD contributed manufacturing know-how and advancements in LFP cell technology.

            For the last several years, Apple has been working to create its own 5G modem, with the eventual goal of eliminating the need to use third-party modem technology. Apple's 5G modem is inching closer to completion, and we could see the first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> with an Apple modem in 2025.

Swapping out a modem chip might not sound like a big deal, but tweaking cellular technology can have a major impact. Apple has to make sure that its 5G modem is as good or better than 5G chips from its current modem supplier Qualcomm before transitioning to its own technology.

            Amazon <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-kindle-color-scribe-paperwhite-entry">today refreshed</a> its popular Kindle e-reader lineup, introducing the first Kindle that has a color display.

<br/>
While Amazon has released tablets with traditional LCD displays that support color, the Colorsoft is E Ink like Amazon's other Kindle tablets, but with new technology that allows for color. Amazon is using LED pixels and a new oxide backplane for color without impacting resolution or increasing latency when turning pages.

<p id="meIDEc">When <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24113616/gmail-email-20-years-old-internet">Gmail first appeared in 2004</a>, the idea of having what seemed like a never-ending space for email was revolutionary. Most paid services were providing a few megabytes of space, and here came Google promising a full gigabyte (which, at the time, seemed huge) for free. I switched to Gmail in 2005, not long after it was first introduced (at least, April of that year is the earliest email I can find in my first account), and I — along with a <em>lot</em> of other users — haven’t looked back since. </p>
