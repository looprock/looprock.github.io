            Google has issued a critical security update for Chrome on macOS, Windows, and Linux that fixes a zero-day vulnerability in the browser. On Tuesday, Google in a Chrome <a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2023/11/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_28.html">stable channel update</a> said it "is aware that an exploit for <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-6345">CVE-2023-6345</a> exists in the wild."

Google has not provided further details about the CVE-2023-6345 exploit, which was discovered last week by security researchers in Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG). However, it is believed to be related to Skia, the open-source 2D graphics library in the Chrome graphics engine.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Meta intends to launch Threads in the European Union next month, according to a report by <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/meta-threads-europe-launch-98448df5">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>.

<br/>
The social media network debuted in most markets in July, but did not launch in the EU because Meta was unsure whether it would be able to adhere to the bloc's stringent regulations for online services. Threads can import data from Instagram, including behavioral and advertising information.

<br/>
According to sources who spoke to <em>WSJ</em>, Meta will comply with the regulations by giving EU users a choice of using Threads purely for consumption, without a profile that allows them to make their own posts.

<p id="5gNwIw">Announced during a keynote speech by AWS CEO Adam Selipsky at AWS re:Invent, Amazon Q acts like an AI assistant where users can ask questions about their businesses using their data. For example, employees can query Amazon Q on the company’s latest guidelines for logo usage or understand another engineer’s code to maintain an app. Q can surface the information instead of the employee sifting through dozens of documents. </p>
