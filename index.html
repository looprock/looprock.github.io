Currently in Apple's smartphone lineup, only the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/does-my-iphone-support-apple-intelligence/">iPhone 15 Pro models support Apple Intelligence</a>, Apple's suite of AI features coming in iOS 18.1, because the features require a minimum of 8GB of RAM. There is only 6GB RAM in the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, so they will miss out.

<br/>
One of the reasons Apple limited region access to Apple Intelligence was that it only supports US English. Another reason Apple Intelligence was previously not available in the EU was because Apple geo-locked access within the bloc, likely due to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/21/apple-intelligence-europe-delay/">regulatory issues</a> related to the Digital Markets Act.
