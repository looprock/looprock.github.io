            <b>Summary:</b><br>

Pegatron chairman T.H. Tung told <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-tariffs-risk-us-electronics-shortages-taiwans-pegatron-says-2025-04-28/">Reuters</a></em> that the on-again, off-again nature of the levies has created confusion for U.S. retailers and disrupted supply chain decisions.
<br/>
<br/>
"Within two months, shelves in the United States might resemble those in third-world countries, where people visit department stores and markets only to find empty shelves, all because everyone is waiting and seeing," Tung said.

The claim from the Chinese leaker, who has sources within Apple's supply chain, comes a few days after industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/iphone-17-air-12gb-ram-rumor/">all be equipped with 12GB of RAM</a>.

Kuo also said even the base-model iPhone 17 could be equipped with 12GB of RAM, but it will depend on whether supply chain shortages can be overcome. He said that Apple will make a final decision on the amount of RAM it will offer in the regular iPhone 17 model by May. Even if the  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's Beats brand is launching its Beats Pill speaker in two new colors today: Navy Blue and Blush Pink. The colors join the original Matte Black, Statement Red, and Champagne Gold colors that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/25/beats-pill-bluetooth-speaker-announced/">debuted last June</a>. Beats introduced special-edition Light Gray and Dark Gray versions in a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/kim-kardashian-beats-pill/">collaboration with Kim Kardashian</a> back in October, but those have since been discontinued.

            <p>Let&rsquo;s get the AI to build D&amp;D adventures for us with a Model Context Protocol Prompt. I haven&rsquo;t found much value in MCP Prompts until now. What makes them excited is when you use them a &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; to chain together other tool calls. In this episode of my MCP programming series, I show you how to make two MCP Prompts. First, a simple one that boot-straps playing D&amp;D. Second, a more complex one that pulls together an adventure overview using multiple tools and &ldquo;reasoning.&rdquo; I think the result gets to a type of agentic AI.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>The AIs are good at being a Dungeon Master for Dungeons &amp; Dragons, but their memory is limited. How can you make sure they don&rsquo;t forget all that loot you just got, or ensure that cobbler back in the village remembers the type of boots you orders and paid for up front? I&rsquo;ll show you how to use Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create a DM Journal. This is done by writing an MCP Server tool that write journal entries and then an MCP Server Resource that allows you to read them. It&rsquo;s just files, but it&rsquo;s a good excuse to learn some agentic AI coding in Java, with the help of Spring AI.</p>
