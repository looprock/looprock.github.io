            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            This week we’re talking about DNS with Paul Vixie — Paul is well known for his contributions to DNS and agrees with Adam on having a “love/hate relationship with DNS.” We discuss the limitations of current DNS technologies and the need for revisions to support future internet scale, the challenges in doing that. Paul shares insights on the future of the internet and how he’d reinvent DNS if given the opportunity. We even discuss the cultural idiom “It’s always DNS,” and the shift to using DNS resolvers like OpenDNS, Google’s 8.8.8.8 and Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1. Buckle up, this is a good one.<br>
