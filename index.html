<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Each ad is about 13 seconds in length, and they are all text-based, providing little tidbits of information about the ‌iPhone‌'s capabilities. For the ‌Find My‌ ad, for example, Apple focuses on parents and children. "‌Find My‌ on ‌iPhone‌ lets you view your kid's location if you need to," it reads.
<br/>
<br/>
The Stolen Device Protection video reminds people that additional ‌iPhone‌ security is available. "Stolen Device Protection adds extra layers of security for your Apple Account if your ‌iPhone‌ is lost or taken."

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            A new Apple job listing has provided more evidence that the company is working on a major overhaul of its Calendar app. 
<br/>

<br/>
A <a href="https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/details/200590045/senior-software-engineer-calendar-experience">senior software engineer position</a> for "Calendar Experience," <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2791509/apple-job-posting-confirms-calendar-revamp.html">spotted</a> by <em>Macworld</em>'s Filipe Espósito, explicitly states that Apple seeks candidates to join a team that will "reimagine what a modern calendar can be across Apple's platforms." Listed on April 29, the posting is surely the clearest acknowledgment yet of Apple's Calendar ambitions.
<br/>

The job listing provides further context for Apple's acquisition of Mayday Labs in April 2024. Per our &lt;a href="https://www.macrum [...]<br>

Pocket is a well-known service that streamlines articles, offering a distraction-free reading experience. It includes offline access, text-to-speech options, and tagging capabilities. Pocket has been integrated in Firefox since 2015, and Mozilla bought the service in 2017.

Fakespot is an online review checking website that Mozilla bought two years ago and integrated into Firefox, but Mozilla said Fakespot "didn't fit a model [it] could sustain."

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Verizon wants to lock subscribers to its network for a longer period of time, and has asked the U.S. Federal Communications Commission [<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1051935705713">PDF</a>] to extend how long customers must wait before a Verizon smartphone can be unlocked and transferred to another carrier.

<br/>
Back when Verizon purchased 700MHz spectrum for its network in 2008, it agreed to unlock smartphones <a href="https://www.verizon.com/support/device-unlocking-policy/">after a 60-day period</a>. Verizon now wants the FCC to waive that requirement, allowing it to change its phone unlocking policy.

Verizon claims that the 60-day unlocking requirement it is subject to leads to fraud and device trafficking. Verizon said it lost an estimated 784,703 devices to fraud in 2023, costing it "hundreds of millions of [...]<br>
