            <b>Published:</b> 2024-08-06 12:40:59-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Flight tracking app <a href="https://www.flightyapp.com">Flighty</a> was today updated with a new feature that is designed to provide users with additional information on the reason behind delayed flights.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Flighty is using aviation authority data and machine learning to provide early warnings of delays, and when a delay is official, the reason for the delay. Most delays are due to airspace issues and late aircraft, both of which Flighty will monitor.
<br/>
<br/>
The app is able to predict delays "hours in advance," and give information to Flighty users that airlines often decline to share. The result is more control over travel plans.<blockquote>For example, the airline might delay your flight by 30 minutes ... and then another hour. But with these updates, Flighty 4 can tell you that's likely to be at least a five-hour d</blockquote> [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-08-06 12:28:16-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            For users looking to transport their Vision Pro units and various accessories, Apple offers the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MW2F3LL/A/apple-vision-pro-travel-case">Apple Vision Pro Travel Case</a> as an optional $199 accessory. But if you're looking for a third-party alternative, WaterField Designs offers a <a href="https://www.sfbags.com/products/vision-pro-shield-case">Shield Case starting at $159</a> that might be worth considering, and I've spent the past few months using one for occasional travel to see how it fares.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is preparing to release a minor iOS 17.6.1 update for the iPhone, according to a post shared today by an anonymous leaker on X, formerly known as Twitter. The leaker has a private account, so we are not identifying it or linking to it, but they have proven to be a consistently accurate source for upcoming iOS updates.

<em>MacRumors</em> can independently confirm that Apple is internally testing an iOS 17.6.1 update, which is present in our analytics logs.

Nothing is known about iOS 17.6.1, beyond the leaker claiming that the update will have a build number of 21G93.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-08-06 05:18:23-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today stopped signing iOS 17.5.1, preventing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users from downgrading to that version of iOS. The update is no longer being signed after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/apple-releases-ios-17-6/">July 29 release of iOS 17.6</a>.

<br/>
Apple often stops signing an older version of iOS, usually within a week or two after a new version is released. When an update is no longer signed, it can't be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side software verification check.

<br/>
This policy encourages users to keep their operating systems up to date, ensuring they have the latest security enhancements.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple TV users will soon be able to AirDrop web links in the menu interface to their iPhone or iPad, thanks to a new feature included in the latest tvOS 18 developer beta.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-870258" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/apple-tv-4k-yellow-bg-feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
As Apple TV owners will know, it is not possible to browse the web on the set-top box, so web links are not something you traditionally come across in the tvOS interface. That looks set to change with tvOS 18.
<br/>
<br/>
In the Apple TV app, Apple is promoting Immersive Videos for Apple Vision Pro, and these include a new button in the description screen that when pressed AirDrops a web link to the user's nearby iOS device.  The feature was discovered by Sigmund Judge in the fifth beta of tvOS 18 that was released to developers on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/apple-seeds-tvos-18-beta-5-to-developers/">Monday</a>.

            With the fifth beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> that came out today, Apple added some notable new features, even though it's getting later in the beta testing process.

Other times, people post to patches to pgsql-hackers and a bunch of discussion ensues, but nothing gets committed. If you're the sort of person who likes to write patches for PostgreSQL, or if you're being paid to do so, you'd probably like to avoid having these things happen to you.

Google has long paid Apple billions of dollars a year to be the default Safari search engine, and this relationship has been under scrutiny as Google battles antitrust allegations made by the United States Justice Department.
