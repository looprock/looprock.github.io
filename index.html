In a <a href="https://bbbprograms.org/media/newsroom/decisions/apple-intelligence">press release</a> today, the NAD said it recommended that Apple discontinue or modify the "available now" text on the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence page</a>, given it falsely conveyed that all of the features listed on the page were available at the time the text was first added.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple devices support a relatively unknown three-finger gesture that lets you share a photo across your devices in super-quick time. It's a neat trick to fall back on if AirDrop is playing up or your iCloud Photos are taking ages to sync.

<br/>
Universal Clipboard is usually associated with copying and pasting text, but by using this gesture, you can make it work really well for sharing images between your devices too.
<br/>
<br/>
It can be used to quickly copy images across nearby devices for pasting into Messages, Notes, emails, Pages, and other apps with input fields.

For the following steps to work, you'll need to have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned on and your devices signed into the same Apple Account and connected to the same network.
