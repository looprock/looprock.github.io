            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The FIDO Alliance is developing new specifications to enable secure transfer of passkeys between different password managers and platforms. <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-publishes-new-specifications-to-promote-user-choice-and-enhanced-ux-for-passkeys/">Announced on Monday</a>, the initiative is the result of collaboration among members of the FIDO Alliance's Credential Provider Special Interest Group, including Apple, Google, Microsoft, 1Password, Bitwarden, Dashlane, and others.

<br/>
Passkeys are an industry standard developed by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium, and were integrated into Apple's ecosystem with iOS 16, iPadOS 16.1, and macOS Ventura. They offer a more secure and convenient alternative to traditional passwords, allowing users to sign in to apps and websites in the same wa [...]<br>

            Apple's 2026 iPhones will use TSMC's next-generation 2-nanometer fabrication process in combination with a new packaging method that will integrate 12GB of RAM, a reputable source of accurate predictions about Apple's plans has claimed.

<br/>
In a <a href="https://weibo.com/1833340431/OBysCwunm">Weibo post</a> on Tuesday, Chinese-language user "Phone Chip Expert" said Apple's A20 chip in iPhone 18 models will switch from the previous InFo (Integrated Fan-Out) packaging to WMCM (Wafer-Level Multi-Chip Module) packaging, while memory will be upgraded to 12GB.
<br/>
<br/>
In terms of the differences in packaging method, InFo allows integration of components, including memory, within the package but focuses more on single-die packaging where memory is typically attached to the main SoC (such as DRAM placed on top or near th [...]<br>

<p id="8Fl29v">Before a podcast was a “podcast,” it was… well, it wasn’t really much of anything. A few of the early believers called them “audio blogs,” and the journalist often credited with coining the term “podcast” also offered “GuerillaMedia” as an alternative in the very same article. (And actually, there’s plenty of debate over exactly who coined the term and when. The history of the podcast is more contentious than you’d think.)</p>
<p id="t4xdEo">It was in 2004, though, that many of the earliest names in on-demand audio began to smush “iPod” and “broadcast” into the word we’ve come to know as the way we all download and listen to shows now.

<p id="VLhmFa">Flipping through your high school scrapbook is a humbling experience. There’s a lot to reckon with — including braces and bootcut jeans, in my case — and you get a sense of what kinds of moments you thought were worth preserving. Apparently, a great deal of funny things happened to my friends and me as we loafed around a suburban coffee shop avoiding homework. Looking through those pages, I can find plenty of documentation of life as we waited for our teammates to finish their tennis matches and turned the communal couch at Caribou Coffee into our own private rec room.

<p id="IRXOSu">For a couple of years, there was nothing on the internet so simultaneously thrilling and terrifying as having your website hit the front page of Digg. Thousands of people, maybe tens of thousands, would immediately come to your site — and there’s a good chance they’d crash it in the process. Hundreds of commenters would debate the merits of whatever you’d created or published, pick fights with you and each other about it, and make you feel like the internet’s main character. At least for a few minutes, until something bigger and newer and more controversial hit Digg.com and everyone moved on.</p>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-10-14 07:40:25-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple Maps in iOS 18 introduces two helpful new features: a centralized Library for saved content and the ability to add personal notes to locations. Here's how to take advantage of these new tools.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961870" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/Generic-iOS-18-Maps-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
<h2>Using the New Library</h2>
<br/>
Apple's iOS 18 update brings significant improvements to the Maps app, and streamlines the process of saving and organizing your favorite locations. Building on the existing Guides feature, the new version introduces a simple "+" button on location listings for quick saving.
<br/>
<br/>
A new Library menu now houses all of your saved places, including those from Guides and Pinned locations. The Library also automatically incorporates previously saved locations, offering a comprehensive view of your favorite spots.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's AI research team has uncovered significant weaknesses in the reasoning abilities of large language models, according to a newly published study.

<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-947754" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Apple-Silicon-AI-Optimized-Feature-Siri-1.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
The study, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05229">published on arXiv</a>, outlines Apple's evaluation of a range of leading language models, including those from OpenAI, Meta, and other prominent developers, to determine how well these models could handle mathematical reasoning tasks. The findings reveal that even slight changes in the phrasing of questions can cause major discrepancies in model performance that can undermine their reliability in scenarios requiring logical consistency.

Apple draws attention to a persistent problem in language models: their reliance on pattern matching rather than genuine logical reasoning. In several  [...]<br>

            The Apple Watch Series 10 arrived a year after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, introducing a revamped design and a more advanced display. Apple did not launch an Apple Watch Ultra 3 this year, leaving last year's ‌Apple Watch Ultra 2‌ as the latest version, so how does it compare to the latest Series 10 model?

            Apple is working on a more affordable version of its spatial computing headset in the form of a $2,000 "Apple Vision" device that could debut as early as next year, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-10-13/apple-smart-home-plans-new-os-smart-displays-vision-pro-integration-robots-m27kw5m7"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

<br/>
The new headset would be a lower-end counterpart to the $3,500 Apple Vision Pro, which was released in February.

<p id="jRb6nY">WordPress.org has taken over a popular WP Engine plugin in order “to remove commercial upsells and fix a security problem,” WordPress cofounder and Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/10/secure-custom-fields/">announced today</a>. This “minimal” update, which he labels a fork of the Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin, is <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/">now called</a> “Secure Custom Fields.”</p>
<p id="N2mI6M">It’s not clear what security problem Mullenweg is referring to in the post. He writes that he’s “invoking point 18 of the plugin directory guidelines,” &lt;a href="https://github.com/wordpress/wporg-plugin-gui</p> [...]<br>

            There have been multiple signs suggesting that Apple's mixed reality Vision Pro headset is struggling to take off, both due to the super high price and the heavy design that limits the amount of time it can be worn for most people. What does the Vision Pro's floundering mean for Apple's work on future virtual and augmented reality projects?

<h2>Vision Pro Interest</h2>
<br/>
Interest in the Vision Pro was high in February when the device first launched because it was an all-new product category for Apple, but that didn't last. The Vision Pro is indisputably impressive, and it is mind blowing to watch a butterfly flit by so closely it feels like you can reach out and touch it, or to see the rough skin of an elephant as it walks right by you, but the magic quickly wears off for most.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18.1, there is a new option to set a "Primary" email address in the Settings app, which means it is easier to change the main email address associated with your Apple Account. The Primary email address is the one that is visible to other people when collaborating on and sharing documents, sending calendar invites, and more.
