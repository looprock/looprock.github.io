            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Scosche today announced the launch of the MagicMount Charge Pro 25W series, introducing several wireless charger options that support the new Qi2.2 specification.

With Qi2.2 accessories, compatible <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models can charge at up to 25W, a wireless charging speed that is comparable to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> 2 25W charging speeds supported by the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            ASUS recently came out with a new 32-inch 6K ProArt Display that's priced at $1,399, so we thought we'd check it out to see how it compares with the Studio Display and the Pro Display XDR from Apple.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>
<br/>
At 32 inches, the ProArt 6K is larger than the 27-inch Studio Display, but it is on par in size with the Pro Display XDR. ASUS doesn't have the same design aesthetic as Apple, so the ProArt 6K's design isn't impressive. There's a square-shaped base, an arm that attaches to the display, and thin bezels at the top and the sides. There's a thicker bottom bezel that houses some quick access control buttons.

<br/>
ASUS' display has the same 218 pixels per inch as the Pro Display XDR, and text looks crisp. Colors are accurate out of the box and can be further tweaked in the Settings menu with different profiles. HDR [...]<br>

On this episode, Jim joins us to reminisce about the early days of Ruby and Rails, share what he's learned from so many years of organizing events, and invite all of us to join him on his upcoming 7500 mile road trip.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Astropad today announced the launch of <a href="http://astropad.com/freshcoat">Fresh Coat</a>, a new anti-reflective screen protector that's designed to make the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> easier to see outdoors and under bright lights.

<br/>
Fresh Coat is a glass screen protector that cuts down on up to 75 percent of reflections while preserving color accuracy.
<br/>
<br/>
We were able to try out Fresh Coat ahead of launch, and can confirm that it does indeed cut down on reflections without impacting the ‌iPhone‌'s color or display visibility, with no sign of haze. Astropad includes a tray that ensures a precise alignment and makes applying the screen protector foolproof, and it comes with an app clip that walks you through the installation process.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, currently in beta, Apple Notes has gained new Markdown support, letting you seamlessly import and export files in the popular plain-text formatting language. Whether you're a developer, writer, or content creator, this long-awaited feature should bridge the gap between your existing Markdown workflow and Apple's native note-taking app.
