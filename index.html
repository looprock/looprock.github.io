            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is no longer signing iOS 18.6, making downgrades from iOS 18.6.2 or iOS 18.6.1 to iOS 18.6 impossible. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/apple-releases-ios-18-6-1/">iOS 18.6.1</a> was released a little over a week ago, swiftly followed by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/20/apple-releases-ios-18-6-2-with-security-fixes/">iOS 18.6.2</a> on Wednesday.

<br/>
Apple often stops signing an older version of iOS, usually within a week or two after a new version is released. When an update is no longer signed, it can't be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side software verification check.

By no longer signing a software version, Apple ensures that customers have the latest security improvements and are not vulnerable to known attacks.

I reviewed the X8 Pro Omni <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/ecovacs-x8-pro-omni-matter/">earlier this year</a>, and I've been using the X9 Pro Omni for over three months now. For something this expensive, I wanted to make sure that I extensively tested it before sharing an opinion.
