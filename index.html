<p>Tech marketers way undervalue identity as a marketing tactic. It works well, just like in shoes and coffee loyalty.</p>
<p>Stickers. Devrel. Community management. Conference schwag.</p>
<p>We assume that people chose one technology over another based on utility (does it work for what they want), and also price. What we miss is the anchoring that happens before that. What buyers put on the short list to evaluate in PoC’s. They put things they identify with, and some throw-away choices. They then go through a lot of work to build up a case for choosing the tech they want, that they identify with.</p>
<p>There’s exceptions, of course, but I think this identity effect drives the majority of decision making.</p>

The Ink Frame is Aura's first color e-paper display, with all other models using LCD displays. According to Aura, the Ink Frame is meant to show photos with a softly lit, vintage look that more closely resembles a printed picture than a digital screen.

The 13.3-inch frame features an E Ink Spectra 6 display with a resolution of 1600 x 1200.

The 2025 ‌iPad Pro‌ comes in 11-inch and 13-inch size options, with no changes to the design. Updates are purely internal, with Apple adding an M5 chip and faster SSDs. Base model ‌iPad Pro‌ options with 256GB or 512GB storage have an M5 chip with a 9-core CPU, 10-core GPU, and 12GB RAM, while the higher-end 1TB and 2TB models feature a 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, and 16GB RAM.

We tested the 13-inch model with a 512GB SSD, so it has a 9-core CPU and 12GB RAM. Multithreaded CPU performance is up about 15 percent compared to the M4 model, a [...]<br>

<br/>
In addition to general performance claims, Apple published a set of specific real-world workload results showing measurable gains in AI-driven applications:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-20 17:32:38-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Samsung is holding a Galaxy Event tomorrow, where the company will unveil its long-awaited "Project Moohan" mixed reality headset that will compete with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>. Samsung says that it is "ushering in a new era" with its upcoming "AI-native devices."

<br/>
Samsung already showed off the Project Moohan AR/VR headset back in January, and it looks a lot like the Vision Pro. It has a display that resembles a set of ski goggles, just like the Vision Pro, and a soft, fabric seal that fits against the face. There's a single padded strap that has a knob at the back for adjusting fit. As with the Vision Pro, Samsung's headset uses an external battery that's meant to be carried in a pocket.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Understanding how your data structures interact with hardware is one of the most powerful ways to improve application performance. This blogpost explores how CPU caches influence speed and how thoughtful struct design in Go can yield massive gains. Through a real-world case study, it shows how replacing a large embedded array with a slice improved performance by more than 40 times by reducing cache misses and improving data locality. Originally published in July 2023, its lessons remain highly relevant today for developers optimizing for memory efficiency and cache-aware programming.</p><br>

<br/>
Cranston raised concerns about Sora after users were able to create deepfakes that featured his likeness without consent or compensation. Families of Robin Williams, George Carlin, and Martin Luther King Jr. also complained to OpenAI about the Sora app.
