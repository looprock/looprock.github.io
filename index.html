            <b>Published:</b> 2025-11-17 11:53:03-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iOS 26.2 beta 3, Apple appears to be laying the groundwork for a future option allowing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users in the EU to choose a different default voice assistant than <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>. Right now, a press and hold gesture on the Side Button only activates ‌Siri‌, but there are multiple references to new Side Button behavior in the beta.

<br/>
The wording suggests that the ‌iPhone‌ will permit users to choose a different app to activate through the Side Button, though this is likely to be limited to people in the EU. Some of the code snippets:
<br/>
<blockquote>- Press and Hold to Speak is not available while the Side Button is assigned to %@.

- Side Button Settings

- Select Another Default Side Button App

<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027106" height="1557" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/chat-for-x-app.jpg" width="2400"/>
<br/>
Chat is rolling out on iOS now via the X app, and it includes support for video and voice calls, disappearing messages, and file sharing, as well as the ability to edit and delete previously sent messages. 
<br/>
<br/>
Any old messages should be carried across to Chat from the old DM system on X (formerly Twitter). Users also have options to block screenshots and get notified of attempts to take them. However, it's worth noting that the E2EE support doesn't encrypt message metadata, and this can include information about the sender as well as the recipient.

X also says that its system lacks safeguards against man-in-the-middle attacks, meaning an encrypted chat could be intercepted without either partic [...]<br>

According to known Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/Qe70h46J1">Instant Digital</a>, Apple is looking to make protective cases for its Pro models that directly integrate touch-based sensor layers.

The leaker provided no further details, but there are some clues to be found in previous research conducted by Apple. A patent application filed by the company in 2024 describes a "<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20240393888A1/en">case with input for an electronic device</a>" and outlines a protective iPhone case designed to act as an input surface rather than passive shielding.

<blockquote>
<p>The McKinsey survey shows one clear signal of progress – workflow redesign. The companies with more success in using effectively using AI, about half say they’re using technology not just to do things faster, but to essentially rewrite how their business works. Most are actively rebuilding how work moves between people and systems. It’s a shift from fine-tuning the old way to creating something new entirely–and that’s what separates real transformation from just minor upgrades.</p>
