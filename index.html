To deploy ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features in China, Apple is working with Alibaba, and the two companies have not yet received regulatory approval in China for the AI products that Apple wants to debut. China's Cyberspace Administration (CAC) must test and approve all AI models before companies can roll out AI services in China, and that's where the process has stalled.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is rumored to be working on a smart home hub that has been nicknamed the "HomePad." The device is expected to have a square iPad-like screen that can be attached to a HomePod-like speaker base, or it can be mounted on a wall.

One question on the minds of Apple fans: will the HomePad be previewed at WWDC next week?
<br/>
<br/>
In his <em>Power On</em> newsletter last weekend, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said that Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/01/wwdc-2025-likely-smaller-scale/">no major new devices ready to ship</a>, so it appears that the HomePad will not be launching soon.

            Apple's Live Photos, introduced in 2015, are photos that capture 1.5 seconds of video before and after you take a picture, with the aim of adding a little bit of life and movement to still images. 
<br/>

<br/>
Since introducing Live Photos, Apple has added some effects to its Photos app that let you turn them into fun animated clips, which you can then share with family, friends, or the wider world. 
<br/>
<br/>
There are three effects in total that you can try on your own Live Photos. Loop repeats the action in a continuous looping video, Bounce rewinds the action backward and forward, and Long Exposure simulates a DSLR-like long exposure effect by blurring motion.

The following steps show how you can apply them to your own Live Photos on iPhone and iPad.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that some writers prefer to use over rich text.

            The 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference is coming up quick, with less than a week to go before the big keynote event. We're sharing a series of rumor recaps this week, for those who want to get a sneak peek at some of the features expected in Apple's upcoming software updates.

<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a> is definitely the OS that we've heard the most about, and rumors suggest that it's going to get a major design overhaul. We've highlighted everything we know below.

<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> is not going to iOS 19, with Apple instead opting to change the numbering for its software updates. Instead, we're going to get ‌iOS 26‌, which will be released alongside iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS [...]<br>

            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a> Messages app will include a new translate feature, according to <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/03/exclusive-ios-26-messages-carplay-more/">9to5Mac</a></em>. Messages will apparently be able to automatically translate incoming and outgoing messages when you're conversing with someone who speaks another language.

<br/>
You can already long press on an incoming message and choose the translate option to translate it to another language, but it seems the process could be sped up with automatic translation options.

Apple is also said to be planning to add an option for a polls in the Messages, which would allow people in group chats to vote. The polls option could be powered by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Samsung recently launched the Galaxy S25 Edge, a super thin smartphone that will compete with Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>. To see what it's like using such a thin phone, <em>MacRumors</em> video editor Dan Barbera used it as his main device for two weeks to see what it might be like to use Apple's equivalent later this year.

<br/>
The Galaxy S25 Edge has a 6.7-inch display, so it's a larger smartphone, but because it's so thin and light, it's easy to hold. It's just 5.8mm thick and it weighs 163 grams, and it's so light that it almost feels like a plastic dummy phone. Apple's ‌iPhone 17 Air‌ could be even thinner at 5.5mm, and it will have a similar display size at 6.6 inches, so it should be a lot like the S25 Edge.

The latest word comes from Apple analyst Jeff Pu. In a research note with equity research firm GF Securities this week, Pu said that he expects the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and so-called iPhone 18 Fold to be equipped with Apple's A20 chip, and he believes the chip will have some key design changes over the A18 and upcoming A19 chips.
<br/>
<br/>
First, Pu reiterated that the A20 chip will be manufactured with TSMC's 2nm process. The current A18 Pro chip in iPhone 16 Pro models is fabricated with TSMC's second-generation 3nm process, while the A19 Pro chip for the iPhone 17 Pro models is expected to use TSMC's third-generation 3nm process.
