            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In its <a href="https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Progress_Report_2025.pdf">2025 Environmental Progress Report</a> released today, Apple revealed that it plans to expand its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/charge-iphone-clean-energy/">Clean Energy Charging feature</a> to iPhone and iPad demo units on display at Apple Stores and other retail stores across the United States.

<br/>
Introduced in the United States in 2022, as part of iOS 16.1, the optional Clean Energy Charging feature enables iPhone users to charge their devices at times of the day when the electric grid is relatively cleaner. Apple says the feature can reduce your carbon footprint by selectively charging when lower carbon-emission electricity is available.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-04-16 12:36:41-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iOS 18.4, Apple added support for robot vacuums to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a>. There are a few Matter-enabled robot vacuums that can be added to the Home app for use with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, including the Deebot X8 Pro Omni from Ecovacs. I've been testing the X8 Pro Omni for the last several weeks to see if it's worth upgrading to a robot vacuum with Matter support to integrate with ‌Siri‌ and ‌HomeKit‌, as well as to check out its cleaning capabilities.

<br/>
<h2>Design</h2>
<br/>
The X8 Pro Omni is a circular vacuum that can both vacuum and mop, so it is an all-in-one floor cleaning bot. It comes with a base that has a dust bag, section for cleaning fluid, a tank for clean water, and a tank for dirty water.

            Apple today shared new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> ads, promoting features like the nano-texture display option and the long battery life.

The first spot features a man sunbathing on a rooftop with his ‌MacBook Pro‌. The sun is blazing, but the Mac's display remains perfectly visible thanks to the nano-texture display.

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Any of Apple's latest ‌MacBook Pro‌ models can be purchased with a nano-texture display option that's designed to cut down on glare when in sunlight and bright indoor lighting. For the anti-glare effect, Apple etches the glass at the nanometer level, and the etching scatters light to remove glare. Adding nano-texture is a $150 upgrade.

<br/>
Apple's second ad features a man who lost his ‌MacBook Pro‌ charger, but he's unaware of that fact because his battery lasts so long. ‌MacBook Pro‌ models with the standard M4 chip can last fo [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When using macOS Finder in List view, you'll see the sizes of individual files – but not folders.
<br/>
Instead, folders show a pair of dashes (--) in the Size column. macOS skips calculating folder sizes by default to keep List view performance fast, especially in directories with many nested files. But if you want to keep an eye on folder sizes in certain locations, or even globally, there are a few ways to do it. Here's how.

What if you want to use List view and still keep an eye on the size of a handful of folders in a specific location – in Documents, for instance, or in a directory synced to a cloud storage service? Or what if you have a super-fast SSD that can handle the pressure of calculating the size of lots of folders on the fly?
