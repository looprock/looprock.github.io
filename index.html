<blockquote>
<p>According to a recent Gartner poll, over half (53%) of participants were exploring Agentic AI, whereas 25% were piloting it and only 6% had reached production mode. The high exploration and pilot percentages suggest strong interest and perceived potential in Agentic AI. However, ==the low production percentage implies barriers to scaling, such as technical complexity, lack of maturity in tools, governance challenges==, or unclear ROI.</p>
