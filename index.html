Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/new-mac-studio-with-m4-max-and-m3-ultra/">new Mac Studio</a> with M4 Max and M3 Ultra chip options began arriving to customers today, but the highest-end model is facing delays.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple plans to release a new Studio Display in late 2025 or early 2026, <a href="https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1890099697811091590">according to Ross Young</a>, a display industry expert and VP at Counterpoint Research.

<br/>
In a subscriber-only post shared on X last month, Young said the new Studio Display will feature the same 27-inch screen size as the current model, but add mini-LED backlighting. This upgrade would result in increased brightness and higher contrast ratio compared to the current model, which has traditional LED backlighting.
<br/>
<br/>
Young did not share any further details, so it is unclear if any other Studio Display specifications would change, such as the refresh rate.

Apple released the Studio Display in March 2022, alongside the first Mac Studio. The standalone display feature [...]<br>

            The upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/11/apple-seeds-ios-18-4-public-beta-3/">iOS 18.4 update</a> for the iPhone includes a smaller but meaningful improvement for Apple's in-car iPhone mirroring system CarPlay.

<br/>
Specifically, CarPlay now shows a third row of icons, up from two rows previously. However, this change is only visible in vehicles with a larger center display. For example, a MacRumors Forums member <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-4-beta-1-bug-fixes-changes-and-improvements.2449908/post-33753569">noticed the change</a> in a Toyota Tundra with a 14-inch screen.

In our testing, CarPlay still showed two rows of four icons in a Honda Civic with a 9-inch screen.

            Apple is expected to replace the iPhone "Plus" model in its upcoming iPhone 17 lineup with an all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air, and so a lot of the rumors about the device have naturally concerned its thickness. Today, we may have learned one more detail in that regard.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models will utilize vapor chamber cooling technology to improve thermal performance, according to the Chinese leaker known as <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/PibBvE4I7">Instant Digital</a>.

<br/>
Vapor chamber technology is already common in many premium Android smartphones. By dispersing heat across a larger surface area, it helps prevent thermal throttling and keeps performance stable, which is a major advantage in thinner, more compact devices.
<br/>
<br/>
This isn't the first time we have heard rumors about Apple's use of vapour chamber heatsinks in the iPhone 17 series. In January, Chinese tech news site <em>MyDrivers</em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/iphone-17-major-thermal-upgrade/">claimed</a> that the entire iPhone 17 lineup, including the regular iPhone 17,  [...]<br>
