            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Elon Musk has threatened legal action against Apple, claiming that the company is violating antitrust rules by favoring OpenAI's ChatGPT in App Store rankings over his Grok AI assistant.
<br/>

<br/>
"Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation. xAI will take immediate legal action," Musk said in a <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1955073616996975095">post</a> on X (Twitter), which he also owns. 
<br/>
<br/>
Musk failed to provide evidence to support his claim. Meanwhile, fellow X users noted that DeepSeek reached #1 overall on the App Store in January, long after Apple's partnership with OpenAI was announced that allows Siri to offload complex queries to ChatGPT.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-12 03:43:01-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 Air will include an A19 Pro chip with a 5-core GPU, according to Weibo leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/5821279480/PFt8mzQAF">Fixed Focus Digital</a>. The Chinese account, which has over two million followers, claims that only the iPhone 17 Pro models will have the full 6-core GPU A19 Pro configuration.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1009894" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iPhone-Air-A19-Pro-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
It's the second time in as many months that Fixed Focus Digital has claimed to reveal accurate details about the ultra-thin device's chip specifications. The reduced GPU core count suggests Apple is using binned chips based on yields, or may be managing thermal constraints in the slimmer form factor, but most users are unlikely to notice the performance difference during typical usage.

The claim contradicts earlier reporting from industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who over a yea [...]<br>

            With the sixth beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, Apple has added several new ringtones that are alternatives to the classic "Reflection" ringtone. Reflection is the ringtone that Apple has long used as the default on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.

<br/>
In addition to the standard Reflection ringtone, there are now six variants: Buoyant, Dreamer, Tech, Pop, Reflected, and Surge.

<br/>
Reflected is identical to the "Alt 1" ringtone option that was added back in the second beta of ‌iOS 26‌.

The classic Reflection ringtone is still the default, so if you prefer one of the new sounds, you'll need to set it manually. Apple also added a new ringtone called Little Bird, which is distinct from the new Reflection options. You  [...]<br>

            When politicians immediately blamed social media for the horrific 2022 Buffalo mass shooting—despite zero evidence linking the platforms to the attack—it was obvious deflection from actual policy failures. The scapegoating worked: survivors and victims&#8217; families sued the social media companies, and last year a confused state court wrongly ruled that Section 230 didn&#8217;t protect them.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's rumored new more affordable MacBook could have a starting price as low as $599 and launch as soon as this year, according to a new report out of Asia.

<br/>
We first learned of Apple's low-cost MacBook plans in late June, when analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the company was developing a "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-to-launch-low-cost-macbook/">more affordable</a>" 13-inch laptop that would compete with Chromebooks and drive MacBook purchases, though he did not mention pricing. 
<br/>
<br/>
Kuo said the new MacBook is set to use an A18 Pro chip, which debuted in the iPhone 16 Pro last year. That would make it the first Mac powered by an iPhone chip. So far, all Apple silicon Macs have used M-series chips, which feature more cores, greater memory capacity, and improved external display [...]<br>

Apple also continues to test the new Siri with its own apps, he said. Apple's own example was an iPhone user asking Siri about their mother's flight and lunch reservation plans based on info retrieved from the Mail and Messages apps.

When it first announced the new-and-improved Siri at WWDC 2024, Apple said it would have better understanding of a user's personal context, on-screen awareness, and deeper per-app controls, with these features to be powered by Apple Intelligence and an upgraded App Intents system.
