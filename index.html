            An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> that was expelled from the cabin of Alaska Airlines flight 1282 on Friday survived a fall of more than 16,000 feet and was discovered intact.

<br/>
Vancouver, Washington resident Sean Bates shared images of the device on Sunday after he found it on the side of Barnes Road in Portland, Oregon. The ‌iPhone‌ was in full working condition and was in fact still open to an Alaska Airlines email. There were no cracks on the display, though it was protected by a case and presumably landed in a forested area with soft ground cover.
<br/>
<br/>
Bates alerted the National Transportation Safety Board, and officials came out to collect the device. The NTSB told Bates that it was the second phone to be found from the flight in the area.

Samsung showed off new OLED TVs with an updated anti-reflective coating that makes them much better in bright rooms and with reflective lights, plus there was a new 8K projector and some very impressive transparent OLED screens.

Samsung had a neat 2D/3D display that uses cameras and eye tracking to display content in 3D without the need for glasses, and Dan was also impressed with a customizable music frame that holds artwork but also serves as a speaker for a subtle surround sound system.
