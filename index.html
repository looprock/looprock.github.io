According to the research firm's Global Shipment Report, China accounted for 24% of all ‌iPhone‌ shipments in Q2 2023, while the U.S. market accounted for 21%. 
<br/>
<br/>
The sluggish U.S. smartphone market in the second quarter is said to have been due to the psychology of consumers delaying the purchase of new phones in anticipation of new ‌iPhone‌ models launching in the second half of this year. However, TechInsight said its results at the same time refl [...]<br>

As early as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/15/apple-tsmc-3nm-production-capacity/">May</a>, Apple was known to have booked nearly 90% of the Taiwanese pure-play foundry for its upcoming next-gen devices. However, Apple is now projected to take 100% of TSMC's capacity in 2023, due to delays in Intel's wafer needs owing to later modifications to the company's CPU platform design plans.

<p>For two decades, Google Search was the invisible force that determined the ebb and flow of online content. Now, for the first time, its cultural relevance is in question.</p> <p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="eJaNij">The first thing ever searched on Google was the name Gerhard Casper, a former Stanford president. As <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/04/30/get-rich-u">the story goes</a>, in 1998, Larry Page and Sergey Brin demoed Google for computer scientist John Hennessy. They searched Casper’s name on both AltaVista and Google. The former pulled up results for Casper the Friendly Ghost; the latter pulled up information on Gerhard Casper the person.</p>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-08-28 06:55:45-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Just a few weeks ahead of Apple unveiling new iPhones, rumors continue to circulate about new color options for the devices. The latest information comes from established leakers <a href="https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1696145808196780032">@MajinBuOfficial</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/URedditor/status/1696146103547146555">@URedditor</a>, who today said the lower-end iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models will be available in a new light green finish.

<br/>
@MajinBuOfficial said it appears the new color option will be very similar to the green finish available for the iPhone 12 and the discontinued iPhone 12 mini. However, the leaker is unsure if the color will be available when the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus launch in September, or introduced as an additional color option in spring 2024.
