            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Alongside iOS 17.2.1, Apple today released iOS 16.7.4 and iPadOS 16.7.4 updates that fix an issue with built-in apps. In some cases, if a user deleted a built-in Apple app on a device running iOS or iPadOS 16.7.3 or earlier, the app would not be able to be reinstalled.

<br/>
From Apple's release notes for the update:<blockquote>This update fixes an issue where built-in Apple apps that may have been deleted may not reinstall.</blockquote>While we haven't heard many complaints about the issue, that is likely because the majority of users have transitioned over to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>. For those who are having a problem with reinstalling a deleted app in iOS 16 or iPadOS 16, the new update will address the problem.

It is unclear how many Android users have a Mac or have a friend with a Mac to rely on, but the fix requires using a Mac to connect to iMessage on Beeper.

            Apple today introduced a new firmware update for the third-generation AirPods. The new firmware is version 6A317, up from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-releases-new-airpods-firmware-2/">6A300 firmware</a> introduced in September.

Apple's AirPods firmware updates do not come with details on new features, so it is unclear what might be included in the software.

<br/>
Apple also does not offer instructions on how to upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ are connected to an iOS device. Putting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ in the case, connecting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to a power source, and then pairing the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to an iOS device or Mac should force the update.
