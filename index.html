I’m using that term from a paper called <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/ai-as-normal-technology">“AI as a Normal Technology."</a> There, resilience means " taking actions now to improve our ability to deal with unexpected developments in the future.” There’s a lot of great thinking in that paper, but I want to narrow it down to what management at companies should be doing with AI-driven projects and strategies.</p>

Unlike shipment figures, which measure yearly sales, installed base data reflects the total number of devices currently in use, making it a key indicator of long-term platform choices.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> is Apple's most popular laptop – a thin, fanless machine that wields quiet power thanks to the efficiency of Apple silicon. While the M4 model isn't exactly old, attention is already turning to its successor.

Apple doesn't telegraph new product launches ahead of time, but we can draw a surprisingly clear picture of what to expect by looking at Apple's silicon roadmap, release cycles, and past upgrades.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is aiming for the upcoming iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max to have the same starting prices as the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max, according to Jeff Pu, an equity analyst with investment firm GF Securities.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
In a research note today, obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>, Pu said his firm's recent "supply chain research" indicates that Apple is focused on "cost management," in an attempt to keep the starting prices of the iPhone 18 Pro models either "unchanged" or at a "similar level" compared to the iPhone 17 Pro models.
<br/>
<br/>
In the U.S., the iPhone 17 Pro starts at $1,099 and the iPhone 17 Pro Max starts at $1,199.

For example, Pu believes that Apple has been negotiating with Samsung and SK Hynix to achieve relatively "favorable" memory chip deals, amid  [...]<br>

<p>If everyone can ship software, what will distinguish the successful companies from the apps that are lost in the noise? It&rsquo;s no longer enough to just spend more time coding, or to be the first with a good idea.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to become even more important to grow other aspects of running a software business:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Customer support</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Building trust</li>
<li>Servers (speed)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course I&rsquo;ll be writing a lot of code too, adding features, fixing bugs. But that&rsquo;s the bare minimum now.</p>
