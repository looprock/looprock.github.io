            Apple in the second beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1 has added a set of new backgrounds for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls that showcase features of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a>.

<br/>
There are nine backgrounds in all, featuring iconic locations around the company's circular headquarters in Cupertino, California, which should be familiar to anyone who has watched a recent Apple event.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, one shows ‌Apple Park‌'s rainbow arch, based on the company's rainbow apple logo and erected as a tribute to its late co-founder Steve Jobs, who helped conceptualize the spaceship-like design of the main building on the campus prior to his death.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-08-19 08:40:45-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18, currently in beta, Apple is allowing iPhone users to replace the flashlight and camera buttons on the Lock Screen with something more useful, or to make them disappear entirely.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954622" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-lock-screen-buttons.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
The dedicated flashlight and camera shortcuts you see at the bottom of your iPhone's Lock Screen were introduced in their current form with the release of iOS 11 alongside the iPhone X in 2018, and the two icons have since been a staple, non-customizable feature.
<br/>
<br/>
But that's all set to change this September with the launch of iOS 18. The Lock Screen buttons on your iPhone can now be replaced with any Control Center option. This includes system features like Dark Mode, Airplane Mode, Accessibility options, Calculator, and Translate, as well as Shortcuts – making the functional possibilities endless.

            Apple's rumored tabletop robot has been spotted in its global supply chain for the first time, Taiwan's <a href="https://udn.com/news/story/7240/8170073"><em>United Daily News</em></a> reports.

Apple has apparently chosen Hongzhun to play a critical role in the development of the forthcoming device. Specifically, the supplier will be responsible for developing key mechanical components and casings for the tabletop robot.

Hongzhun is a subsidiary of Foxconn, a longstanding manufacturing partner of Apple.
