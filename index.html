            <p>You can ask Claude to make you quick D&amp;D maps. This is useful if you’re solo roleplaying with it. As you create encounters together, having a map is good for tracking complicated situations and getting spatial awareness. The only thing is you’re making very crude vector maps (SVGs), not the more realistic ones that ChatGPT will make. It feels like it takes just as long to make the initial map, but so far they’re less cheesy and more useful - utilitarian. Also, the first map is usually fine for using. The result is you don’t slow down play by spending a lot of time making and refining a map.</p>

            Donald Trump just cut off all trade negotiations with Canada because an Ontario ad campaign quoted Ronald Reagan accurately. The quotes are real. The context is accurate. But Trump called them &#8220;fake&#8221; and &#8220;fraudulent,&#8221; and the Reagan Foundation—the institution literally tasked with preserving Reagan&#8217;s legacy—backed him up by lying about what their own guy said [&#8230;]<br>

<br/>

<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Unsurprisingly, there are few changes to the device because the only new features are a new M5 chip and a faster SSD, but iFixit did find some subtle tweaks related to repairability.
<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a>'s casing is still secured with P5 screws, and battery replacement is more difficult than it needs to be because Apple only sells the battery as part of the main chassis that also includes the keyboard. Getting to the fan, ports, and other components inside the ‌MacBook Pro‌ requires removing the logic board, and iFixit says that essentially every component in the ‌MacBook Pro‌ has to come out to perform a battery replacement following Apple's official repair steps.

            At least some new iPhone models launching next year may support full 5G satellite internet, according to a <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-musks-spacex-finally-satellite-deal">report this week from <em>The Information</em></a>.

"Apple plans to add support in upcoming iPhones as early as next year for 5G networks that aren't tethered to Earth's surface, which includes satellites," the report said. "That would give the iPhone full internet access over satellite," it added.
<br/>
<br/>
If the earliest 2026 timeframe is met, that means the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and the long-rumored foldable iPhone would likely be the first models to support full 5G satellite internet, followed by the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/03/iphone-18-not-expected-next-year/">standard </a> [...]<br>

Microsoft's Copilot Fall Release introduces <a href="https://youtu.be/mOjGOLHG6AY">Mico</a> – an animated orb that serves as the voice mode's visual companion. Mico (its name a nod to Microsoft Copilot) listens, reacts, and changes colors based on the user's interactions, with the aim of giving the AI chatbot a cuter, more approachable presence.
<br/>
<br/>
That said, Microsoft's attempt to soften its AI offering could backfire if users tap Mico repeatedly – the action briefly turns Mico into Clippy (officially named Clippit), the animated paperclip assistant that first appeared in Office 97 and became a fixture o [...]<br>
