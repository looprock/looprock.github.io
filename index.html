            Apple is working on a refreshed version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a>, and it will have an updated processor that's based on the S-series chips inside the Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Series 10, and the upcoming Apple Watch Series 11.

<br/>
A reference to a ‌HomePod mini‌ equipped with a chip that uses T8310 microarchitecture was discovered in Apple code by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris. The device has a B525 codename, which likely corresponds to the next-generation ‌HomePod mini‌, since the current model's codename is B520.
<br/>
<br/>
The existing S9 and S10 chips in the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Series 10 have T8310 cores, and we're expecting the S11 in the Apple Watch Series 11 to use the same technology.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Rumors suggest that Apple is working on an updated version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> that's slated for launch later this year. Information about the upcoming device that was found in Apple code indicates that it will be equipped with the A17 Pro chip.
<br/>

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012305" height="1181" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/Apple-TV-2025-Thumb-2.jpg" width="2100"/>
<br/>
There have been multiple rumors about a new ‌Apple TV‌ coming in 2025 with a new A-series processor, but it hasn't been clear which chip Apple would use until now. 
<br/>
<br/>
The A17 Pro was designed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Pro models, but Apple still makes it for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-mini-7/">iPad mini 7</a>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is still working on a next-generation version of the Studio Display, and <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris discovered signs of the new display in Apple code.
<br/>

<br/>
The upcoming Studio Display 2 has a codename of J427, and references to J427 were tucked away in software code that Apple didn't mean to publish. Rumors suggest that the next-generation Studio Display will come out in early 2026, so it makes sense that Apple is testing it now.
<br/>
<br/>
We don't know a lot about the next-generation Apple display, but it is possible it will use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-mini-led-studio-display/">mini-LED backlighting</a>. If the Studio Display does indeed adopt mini-LED technology, we can expect improved brightness, a higher contrast ratio, and better color quality.

Apple accidentally leaked some internal information about the upcoming chip, and it turns out it will have the same T8310 architecture as the S9 and S10 chips in the Series 9 and Series 10 Apple Watch models.

It's not unusual for Apple to use the same architecture across multiple versions of the S-series chips for the Apple Watch. The S6, S7, and S8 chips all had the same core technology.

The S9 and S10 chips use two "Sawtooth" performance cores like the A16 Bionic chip, so while it is older technology, it's still a lot of pow [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Rumors continue to surface about Apple launching an affordable MacBook as early as this year.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1008940" height="1508" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/Low-Cost-MacBook-Feature-A18-Pro.jpg" width="2680"/>
<br/>
Below, we recap all of the reports and rumors so far.
<br/>
<br/>
Taiwanese supply chain publication <em>DigiTimes</em> expects the laptop to have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/11/new-12-9-inch-macbook-launch-this-year-599-price/"><strong>starting price of between $599 and $699</strong></a> in the United States.
<br/>
<br/>
The publication said the lower-cost MacBook will be equipped with a <strong>12.9-inch display</strong>, and a version of the <strong>A18 Pro chip</strong> that debuted in the iPhone 16 Pro models last year. It would become the first Mac to ever use an A-series chip from an iPhone.

The lower-cost MacBook could launch in <strong>late 2025 or early 2026</strong> [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-13 08:05:16-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, Apple has a helpful new feature that notifies you when your iPhone's camera lens needs cleaning – something Android devices have offered for years. Here's how to turn on this smart notification system.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1014400" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/clean-back-camera-hint.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
Whenever your iPhone's camera is active, iOS 26 monitors the incoming light for signs of reduced clarity or smudging that could indicate a dirty lens. When triggered, you'll see a discrete alert suggesting you clean your camera lens to improve image quality.
<br/>
<br/>
To benefit from the feature, you'll need an iPhone running iOS 26 (currently in beta). It's currently unclear which models support Lens Cleaning Hints, but you can check by looking for the following toggle:
<br/>
<ol><li>Open <strong>Settings</strong> on your iPhone.</li>
<br/>
<li>Scroll down and tap <strong>Camera</strong>.</li>
<br/>
</ol> [...]<br>
