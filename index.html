            <b>Published:</b> 2023-10-05 15:47:31-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Social network X, previously known as Twitter, may soon offer more than one subscription tier. Code in the app suggests that the Premium offering could be split into three, including Premium Basic, Premium Standard, and Premium Plus.

<br/>
Premium basic lists "full ads" in the For You feed, while Premium Standard says it has "half ads" in For You. Premium Plus says there will be no ads in For You. Given the specific mention of the For You feed, it sounds like all of the tiers will continue to have ads in replies. Revenue from reply ads is used for paying content creators on the social network.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is working on two new versions of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> 6, according to a report from <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/10/05/ipad-mini-7-new-ipad-air-rumors/">9to5Mac</a></em>. The site claims that Apple has four separate models in the works (two each in cellular and Wi-Fi), though it is not clear what the differentiating factor would be if there are indeed two separate ‌iPad Air‌ models coming.

<br/>
Apple makes two versions of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> because it comes in two sizes, and <em>9to5Mac</em> speculates that Apple could release a larger version of the ‌iPad Air‌ to go along with the current 10.9-inch version, or debut "a more expensive model with better specs."

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> was introduced in March last year, adding the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip, Center Stage on the front-facing camera, a faster USB-C port, and several new color options, but it was still a fairly minor upgrade over the previous model from September 2020.

found two ways to improve the talk.  First, in researching my <a class="txt2html" href="https://momjian.us/main/presentations/performance.html#beyond" style="text-decoration: none;"><em>Beyond Joins and Indexes</em></a> talk, I was reminded (slide 65) of the
difference in NULL handling between NOT IN and NOT EXISTS.  I realized this information should be my nulls talk, so I added slide 25 to cover this.

<p>Second, someone asked during the Q&amp;A if I could summarize how to avoid problems with NULLs so I added slide 44 at the end.  Humorously my major recommendation was to liberally use NOT
NULL column constraints where appropriate to prevent their existence.  Fewer nulls, fewer prob</p> [...]<br>
