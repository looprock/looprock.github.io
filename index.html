            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple Maps is catching up with Google Maps on iOS 17 by finally letting iPhone users download maps for offline use. iOS 17 will be released to the public later this year for the iPhone XS and newer, and is currently available in beta for developers.

Users can download a specific area of Apple Maps to their iPhone and view it while offline, complete with turn-by-turn directions for driving, walking, cycling, and public transit.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The iOS Camera app offers a few optional settings to help you line up your shots, most notably a Grid that can be overlaid on the screen to help apply the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds">rule of thirds</a>.
<br/>

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899139" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/ios-17-collage.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
And for the last few years, the Grid mode has included a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/hidden-camera-level-tool-ios-11/">somewhat-hidden leveling feature</a> for top-down photos, popping up a floating crosshair to help make sure you're lined up properly above your subject.
<br/>
<br/>
With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, Apple is enhancing the camera leveling functionality, separating it out from the Grid mode to its own option and expanding it to include a horizontal level for more traditional straight-on photos.
