            Writing Tools is one of the main Apple Intelligence features that's available in the iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1 betas for developers and public beta testers.

This guide goes over everything you can do with Writing Tools, where you can use them, and what you need to access the feature.

There are various AI tools that will write content for you, but that's not how Apple designed Writing Tools and that's not what it's meant to do. The feature can be used to improve, tweak, and refine what you've written, but you still need to write something for it to work with first.

            With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models that came out last year, Apple added an opt-in battery setting that limits maximum charge to 80 percent. The idea is that never charging the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> above 80 percent will increase battery longevity, so I kept my ‌iPhone‌ at that 80 percent limit from September 2023 to now, with no cheating.

            Apple's latest iPhone 16 models include a new Camera Control button (located on the lower right-hand side when holding the phone in portrait mode). The new button aims to make it easier to adjust photography settings when shooting with the iPhone in both portrait and landscape orientation.

A simple press of the Camera Control button brings up the Camera app when the iPhone is unlocked. Once the Camera app is open, another press takes a picture, while pressing and holding the button records video for as long as you hold it down.

Within the Camera app, a light press on the button engages a haptic click that also allows for adjusting things like manual exposure and zoom, thanks to a handy sliding interface that operates similarly to a camera dial. This gesture also reveals a clean preview of the scene you'r [...]<br>

Apple routinely stops signing older iOS releases over time in order to prevent users from downgrading to an outdated software version. iOS 17.6.1 no longer being signed comes one week after Apple released iOS 18 to the public.

iPadOS 17.6.1 is likely still signed for iPad Pro models with the M4 chip only because <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/20/apple-working-to-fix-ipados-18-m4-ipad-pro-issue/">iPadOS 18 has been temporary pulled for those devices</a>.

<p id="EkLaRj">Amazon Prime Day is one of the biggest shopping events of the year outside of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, with this year’s autumnal incarnation (once again dubbed Prime Big Deal Days) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/17/24244180/amazon-october-prime-day-big-deal-days-fall-dates-2024">running from October 8th through the 9th.</a> The two-day shopping affair will likely grant Prime members access to some of the best prices of the year on Amazon devices, as well as products from Sony, Sonos, Peloton, Withings, and other well-known brands. This applies to items spanning a range of categories, including gaming peripherals, laptops, 4K TVs, phones, PC accessories, and more. </p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is working behind the scenes to get ready to introduce Hearing Assistance functionality to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2. The latest iOS 18.1 beta does not have the feature enabled at the current time, but it is hidden in the update and Apple could potentially activate it in a future iOS 18.1 beta.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With macOS 15.1 and iOS 18.1 beta 5, Apple has enabled drag and drop, a much anticipated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Mirroring feature. After updating to the new software, you can drag files from an ‌iPhone‌ to a Mac and vice versa.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956750" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macos-sequoia-iphone-mirroring.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
‌iPhone‌ Mirroring makes it simple to move files from one device to another because it works even when the ‌iPhone‌ is locked and charging. To use the feature, update to the fifth macOS 15.1 and iOS 18.1 betas and then activate ‌iPhone‌ Mirroring. 
<br/>
<br/>
From there, if you drag a file like a photo from Mac to the open <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app on the ‌iPhone‌, it'll transfer over. If you want to transfer a PDF, just open the Files app and then drag the PDF [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the fifth beta of iOS 18.1, Apple has made a small tweak to the Camera Control button that was introduced on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a>, and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max.

<br/>
When you dig into the Camera Control settings, there is now a way to set it to the front-facing camera without having to interact with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s display.
<br/>
<br/>
To get to the selfie camera, open up the Camera app with a press on the Camera Control button, and then use a swipe gesture on the button to scroll through the lenses. The person icon at the very top swaps to the front-facing selfie camera.
