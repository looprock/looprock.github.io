            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            EV manufacturer Rivian appears to finally be rolling out support for Apple's digital car keys available through the Wallet app on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and Apple Watch. Rivian <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/rivian-car-keys-support/">announced support for the feature</a> in debuting its second-generation R1S and R1T over a year ago, but the company had not activated it until today, as spotted in an Apple configuration file by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is working on a new version of the Powerbeats earbuds called the Powerbeats Fit, and the company shared a teaser video of the upcoming earbuds on its YouTube channel.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The Powerbeats Fit look similar to the Beats Fit Pro, featuring a small in-ear earbud with a silicone wingtip that secures them in the ear. "Fit for every move," reads the tagline of Apple's video.
<br/>
<br/>
The Powerbeats Fit could have some of the same features as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/powerbeats-pro/">Powerbeats Pro</a> 2, such as heart rate sensing and Active Noise Cancellation.
<br/>
<br/>
Little is known about the Powerbeats Fit right now, but Apple says they are coming in fall 2025. Fall 2025 technically begins on September 22, so we could see them sometime after Apple's September 9 iPhone-centric event.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/">Beats</a></div><br/>This article, " [...]<br>

<br/>
Apple's Crossbody Strap reportedly features an unusual magnetic design; it likely has a "flexible metal core" that makes it magnetic along its entire length. At the ends, "rings polarized oppositely to the strap close the system." The design eliminates the need for conventional hooks or loops.
<br/>

Samples of the Crossbody Strap are apparently made from a woven nylon material similar to the Apple Watch's Sport Loop bands. Apple may also introduce a silicone variant.

Apple told the <em><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgj9kjmvzzo">BBC</a></em> that proposed regulations from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) "are bad for users and bad for developers," and pointed to the European Union's Digital Markets Act, which it says has already caused feature delays for European users, as evidence of regulatory overreach.
