Apple is working on a next-generation version of the iPad mini (codename J510/J511) that features the A19 Pro chip, according to information found in code that Apple mistakenly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/ipad-mini-a19-pro-chip/">shared</a> in August.

<br/>
The Charge Limit is a setting that's available in addition to Optimized Battery Charging, and it can prevent a Mac from ever charging to 100 percent.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple's existing Optimized Battery Charging feature keeps a Mac from charging to 100 percent until it's needed for use, with the option using your daily charging routine to determine when to charge to full. While Optimized Battery Charging can help preserve battery life, it still regularly allows a Mac to charge to 100 percent.

<br/>
Apple removed the compact tab bar option with the launch of ‌macOS Tahoe‌ and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a>, but there were Mac and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> users who missed it.
<br/>
<br/>
The Safari app on Mac and the Safari section of the Settings app on ‌iPad‌ both now feature an option to toggle on the Compact Tab Bar as an alternative to the standard Separate Tab Bar.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The iOS 26.4 update that Apple is beta testing includes a new "Playlist Playground" feature in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> app that's designed to let users create a playlist with a text-based prompt.

<br/>
In the ‌Apple Music‌ app, there's an option to type in an idea and get automatic song suggestions for a playlist. Apple has some pre-set suggestions that include "morning coffee music," "hip-hop party songs," and "disco songs that defined the 1970s," but you can type in any idea, mood, or feeling.
<br/>
<br/>
From there, the Playlist Playground feature will automatically generate a list of 25 songs, along with a custom title. Playlists that you create can be customized further with additional text prompts, and you can select a cover and a description.

            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/">macOS Tahoe</a> will be the last version of macOS that supports Intel-based Macs, with Apple planning to phase out Intel Macs entirely following its transition to Apple silicon.

<br/>
Apple today reminded developers and users that future versions of macOS will not support Intel machines, and Rosetta 2 support for apps will end after macOS 27.
<br/>
<br/>
Starting with ‌macOS Tahoe‌ 26.4, when users launch an app that uses Rosetta 2, there will be a popup letting them know that the app will no longer work when support for Rosetta 2 ends.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that it will continue to support older, unmaintained gaming titles with Rosetta along with software running Intel binaries in Linux VMs beyond macOS 27. There could also be future security fixes.

The Weibo-based leaker, known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a>," says that the ‌iPad Pro‌ will not have a major update for a prolonged period of time.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Iteration has long been one of the more fragmented areas of Go, with developers relying on ad hoc patterns to traverse custom data structures. This article explores the range-over-functions experiment, a proposed evolution of the language that introduces a standardized iterator model while preserving Go&rsquo;s familiar for range syntax. Using the new iter package and sequence abstractions, it shows how iteration logic can be expressed more clearly, flexibly, and idiomatically. Originally published in April 2024, the concepts remain highly relevant as Go continues to evolve toward more expressive yet simple language features.</p><br>
