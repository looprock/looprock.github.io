Job Simulator is a VR game where automation and robots have replaced all human jobs. Players can relive what it was like to work as a human with not-so historically accurate recreations of jobs that include an office worker, gourmet chef, and store clerk.
<br/>
<br/>
The game uses hand tracking for control purposes, which means no controller is required. Hands can be used for interacting with, throwing, and smashing objects.

            Apple today stopped signing iOS 17.5, preventing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users from downgrading to that version of iOS. The update is no longer being signed after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/20/apple-releases-ios-17-5-1-photos-bug/">May 20 release of iOS 17.5.1</a>.

<br/>
It is not unusual for Apple to stop signing an older version of iOS, and it typically happens a week or two after a new version of iOS comes out. When an update is no longer signed, it means it is no longer able to be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ per a server side software verification check.

Apple prevents users from installing older versions of iOS to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date with the latest security improvements.

<p id="NQPWLg">Browser bloat has long been a problem, but now Microsoft is doing something about it, and not by reducing features but by speeding the browser up. The company is working to make Edge’s user interface more responsive, starting with its Browser Essentials menu.</p>
<p id="Z0z1mk">This menu — which displays information about Edge’s performance — is now 42 percent faster, thanks to a WebUI 2.0 architecture migration. You can see how much faster the Browser Essentials menu loads on WebUI 2.0 compared to React and WebUI with Javascript in the video below. Microsoft says the menu is 76 percent faster on devices without an SSD or with less than 8GB of RAM.</p>
