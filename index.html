In a post this week, the leaker said the A19 Pro chip will have a 6-core GPU in the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max, but only a 5-core GPU in the iPhone 17 Air. This means the iPhone 17 Air would have slightly slower graphics performance for gaming compared to the Pro models, but the average customer is unlikely to notice much of a difference.

<br/>
The streaming service's website and mobile apps now display the HBO Max branding once again. Max.com redirects to <a href="https://www.hbomax.com">hbomax.com</a>, while both the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hbo-max-stream-movies-tv/id1666653815">Apple App Store</a> and Google Play Store have updated their listings. Users won't need to download a new app, as existing installations will automatically update to show the HBO Max name.
<br/>
<br/>
The App Store update includes a cheeky note: "Same app. New-ish name. The plot twist everyone has been waiting for: Max is now HBO Max."

Apple users will interact with Support Assistant through chats.

Being a dad, I got excited to explain a simple thing in detail, “well,” I started. “No, let’s ask the circle!” and by that she meant voice mode in ChatGPT.</p><p>So we did: “Well, saying ‘please’ is kind of a way to show respect and appreciation when you’re asking someone for something. It just helps to make the interaction a bit more polite and friendly, which usually makes people more willing to help you out.”</p><p>Of course, I immediately wanted to ask the logical follow up question, “yes, but <em>why</em> does it show respect and appreciation” which is the crux of the question, and then another: and why is that ‘nice’? This the important thing: saying the effect of something - saying “please” - doesn’t tell you the why and how of something.
