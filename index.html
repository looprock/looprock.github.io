            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Starting on iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and macOS Sonoma, Apple encrypts the titles of Voice Memos stored in iCloud, in addition to the recordings themselves.

<br/>
As a result of this change, Apple says the titles of existing Voice Memos might only show the date and time of the recording on devices running older software versions.

<br/>
Apple explains in a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213863">new support document</a>:<blockquote>Because of this additional encryption, when you update one of your Apple devices to iOS 17, iPadOS 17, or macOS Sonoma, your devices that you haven't yet updated—with older versions of Voice Memos—may display the date and time of the recording (for example, "2023-08-11T07:53:31Z") as the title, rather than the previous title of the recording.</blockquote>Apple already encrypted Voic [...]<br>

If a black screen with an iPhone appears on the TV, users can unlock their iPhone, hold it close to the Apple TV, and follow the on-screen recovery steps on the iPhone. When the recovery process is completed, the Apple TV will reboot.

On the Apple TV HD, there is a USB-C port that allows the device to be restored with a Mac over a wired connection.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>A little while ago, Etsy introduced a new feature in its iOS app that could place Etsy sellers' artwork on a user's wall using Apple's Augmented Reality (AR) tools. It let them visualize how a piece would look in their space, and even gave them an idea of its size options. When we launched the feature as a beta, it was only available in "wall art"-related categories, and after the initial rollout we were eager to expand it to work with more categories. </p>
<p>What differentiates Etsy is the nature of our sellers’ unique items. Our sellers create offerings that can be personalized in numbers of ways, and they often hand-make orders based on demand. Taking the same approach we did with wall art and attempting to show 3D models of millions of Etsy items – many of which could be further customized – would be a huge undertaking. Nevertheless, with inspiration from <a href="https://careers.etsy.com/global/en/guiding-principles">Etsy's Guiding Principles</a>, we decided to dig deeper into the feature. What could</p> [...]<br>
