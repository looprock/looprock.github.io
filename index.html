            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Through its Developer website, Apple is offering a $300 "Developer Strap" for the Vision Pro, which provides a USB-C connection between the headset and a Mac.

As noted by <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/02/vision-pro-developer-strap"><em>Daring Fireball</em>'s John Gruber</a>, the Developer Strap is only available to developers who are logged in to a paid U.S. Apple Developer account.
