            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-27 07:45:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The upcoming iOS 18.4 update for the iPhone adds an Ambient Music feature to Control Center. Below, we take a closer look at how it works.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996862" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iOS-18-4-Ambient-Music-Control-Center.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
iOS 18.4 is currently in beta, so the Ambient Music feature is not widely available yet. The update will likely be released to the general public <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/ios-18-4-next-week/">next week</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
To use the feature on iOS 18.4, open Control Center and tap on the plus sign in the top-left corner. Then, tap on "Add a Control" at the bottom of the screen, scroll down to the Ambient Music section, and add one or more of the controls.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is how Apple describes the four Ambient Music themes:<ul><li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Music for a restful sleep.</li>
<br/>
<li><strong>Chill:</strong> Music for relaxation.&lt;/li</li></ul> [...]<br>

            Last week, we covered a report claiming that Apple's book-style foldable iPhone (or "iPhone Fold," as we are provisionally calling it here) will use liquid metal hinges to improve durability and help minimize screen creasing.

According to the Weibo account <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/Pkvb9FIcN">Instant Digital</a>, Apple has chosen metallic glass (amorphous metal) for the iPhone Fold's hinge mechanism.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is preparing to sell new Beats-branded charging cables, according to placeholder product listings on a handful of reseller websites in Canada and Europe.

<br/>
There are listings for three different 5-foot/1.5-meter cables, including USB-C to USB-C, USB-C to Lightning, and USB-C to USB-A variants. All of the cables have a tangle-free, braided design for extra durability and convenience. The cables will be available in at least three never-before-seen color options, including Bolt Black, Surge Stone, and Rapid Red, and it appears that they will be sold in one-pack and two-pack varieties.
<br/>
<br/>
The USB-C to USB-C cable supports 60W fast charging, and it has USB 2.0 data transfer speeds of up to 480 Mbps, according to one of the listings.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-26 16:53:06-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple regularly refreshes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> models, and a new version that uses M5 series chips is in the works. Apple just finished refreshing most of the Mac lineup with M4 chips, and now it's time for the M5. Rumors suggest that we could see the first M5 ‌MacBook Pro‌ models this fall.

<br/>
<h2>Design</h2>
<br/>
There have been no rumors of a design update for the M5 ‌MacBook Pro‌ models that are coming this fall, so we are expecting the same look as the current models. There might be minor updates, but most of the changes will be internal.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple probably won't change the design of the ‌MacBook Pro‌ until it transitions to OLED display technology, and that's not rumored to happen until 2026 at the earliest.

            Utah today passed the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> Accountability Act, a law that requires mobile app stores from Apple and Google to verify the age of users rather than having individual apps do age verification.

According to <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/26/utah-adopts-child-safety-law-requiring-apple-google-to-verify-user-ages.html">CNBC</a></em>, Utah Governor Spencer Cox signed the bill this afternoon. It is the first law related to mobile app store age verification that has passed in the U.S., and it will require Apple to verify user age when an Apple Account is created. If a child under the age of 18 opens an account, Apple will need to link the account to a parent's account, and parents will have to consent to app purchases.

In a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/sessions/2025-03-14/apple-s-2025-plans-and-strategy-live-q-a">live-streamed Q&amp;A session</a> today, Gurman said that Apple currently has no plans to reintroduce a smaller iPhone model.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple discontinued the iPhone 13 mini <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-iphone-13-mini/">in September 2023</a>, and it has not offered a mini model since then. Apple is not expected to release an iPhone 17 mini this year, and Gurman's revelation likely rules out an iPhone 18 mini next year too, given Apple's multi-year planning and development cycle for future iPhone models.

            Lots of lies are told about immigrants to stoke the always-smoldering fires of bigotry in this country. Trump and his fellow Republicans have told most of them. They claim immigrants commit more crimes than legal residents, something that has never been true. They claim immigrants are lazy, something anyone who&#8217;s ever worked with any immigrants [&#8230;]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today shared a new "Behind the Mac" video that's focused on hit <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+ show Severance, demonstrating how Macs were used for editing the series.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The 11-minute video is accompanied by <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/how-the-mind-splitting-world-of-severance-comes-together-on-mac/">an in-depth article</a> with additional details, but be warned, there are season two spoilers in both the video and the article.
<br/>
<br/>
According to Severance editor Geoffrey Richman, the final episode of the series was one of the most difficult to edit. One scene had 70 angles and takes to choose from, so he used a single multicam clip to play nine angles simultaneously to choose the most ideal shots. There was around 83TB of footage to comb through.
<br/>
<br/>
Richman primarily uses an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, and because he works remotely, he connects [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In the United States, the Apple Card offers a high-yield savings account option, allowing you to earn far more interest on your money compared to the average bank's basic savings account. However, the account's interest rate was lowered this week, with the annual percentage yield (APY) dropping from 3.9% to 3.75%.

<br/>
If you deposited $1,000 into the account, and maintained that balance for one year, you would earn $37.50 in interest based on the current APY.
