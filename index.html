            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is planning to launch an all-new iPhone 17 model next year with a "significantly thinner" design, according <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-a-thinner-iphone-in-2025">to <em>The Information</em></a>. The report says the device could have a higher price tag than the Pro Max model, which currently starts at $1,199, suggesting that the device would become the new highest-end model in the lineup.

The device will allegedly feature a "major redesign" akin to the iPhone X, and this could involve the rear cameras being relocated from the top-left corner of the device to the "top center," along with a narrower Dynamic Island. The device will have between a 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch display size, the report adds. Other potential features mentioned include an aluminum chassis, an A19 chip, an [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Over the past few days, some iPhone users have said the "Allow Apps to Request to Track" toggle in the Settings app is suddenly grayed out on their devices. The issue was <a href="https://x.com/iDeviceHelpus/status/1791298492004188306">highlighted by @iDeviceHelpus on X</a>, and in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/1cthk6t/allow_apps_to_request_to_track_setting_is_greyed/">post on Reddit</a>.

<br/>
Apple's fine print below the grayed-out toggle says "this setting cannot be changed because a profile is restricting it, or because your Apple ID is being managed, does not meet the minimum age requirements, or is missing age information." However, many affected users say none of these reasons actually apply to them.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Developers who want to develop browsers for iOS with third-party engines can only test their apps on devices physically located in the EU, according to <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/17/apple_browser_eu/"><em>The Register</em></a>.

<br/>
This rule introduces a considerable barrier for developers outside the EU, who are now limited to using simulators instead of actual devices for testing their browsers. This restriction complicates the process of developing and supporting browsers with alternative engines, as on-device testing is essential to accurate performance assessment and troubleshooting. Apple's previous policy, which remains in place in other regions around the world, demands the use of WebKit for all iOS and iPadOS browsers, effectively making every browser on these platforms a variant of Safari.

The screenshot shows several custom columns, including a "For you" and several topic-based columns. Favorite searches, topics/keywords, accounts, saved posts, and notifications can be pinned at the current time, and there is an auto-refresh option to keep columns up to date with the newest posts.
