Apple first added cycling directions to ‌‌Apple Maps‌‌ in iOS 14, providing specific directions for bike riders with bike lanes, bike paths, and bike-friendly routes that highlight steep inclines, stairs, and other obstacles.

Prior to this expansion, cycling directions in ‌Apple Maps‌ were primarily available in select countries and major cities across North America, Europe, Oceania, and Southeast Asia.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-07 01:18:33-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, currently in beta, creating a new task for Apple's Reminders app is now a much faster process, thanks to the introduction of a "New Reminder" control that lets you create tasks without ever opening the app. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010930" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/ios-26-reminders-app-control-center.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
Whether you assign it to Control Center, your Lock Screen, or the Action button (on iPhone 15 Pro models and newer), this simple addition should make it a lot easier to record your reminders.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How the New Reminder Control Works</h2>
<br/>
When you activate the New Reminder control, the Reminders app isn't actually opened. Instead, iOS 26 displays a compact popup panel that includes everything you need to create a task: you can select the Reminders List, add a note, the date, location, and a flag.

Sonos manufactures its devices in Vietnam and Malaysia, and the countries are facing tariffs of 20 percent and 19 percent, respectively. In the third fiscal quarter, tariffs cost Sonos $2.1 million, and the company estimated that costs would increase to $5 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2025. Sonos said that the estimate for 4Q 2025 reflects the prior 10 percent tariff rate on in-transit inventory that will arrive during the quarter, and future quarters "may differ."

To minimize the impact of tariffs, Sonos says that  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Medical technology company Masimo has been facing off with Apple in court since 2020, and while Masimo has scored some wins, it's been an expensive endeavor.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-759072" height="897" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/apple-watch-series-6-blood-oxygen-monitoring-1.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
In its quarterly earnings reports, Masimo outlines how much it has spent on litigation. The way Masimo's spending is reported has changed over the last five years, but looking at earnings reports and information from Masimo executives gives a look at how much legal fights can cost. 
<br/>
<br/>
Masimo's ITC case against Apple began in 2021, and it ultimately led to an Apple Watch import ban. Apple was forced to remove blood oxygen monitoring from Apple Watches sold in the U.S. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/apple-watch-removed-from-online-store/">in December 2023</a>.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-06 14:43:33-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            U.S. President Donald Trump today said that there will be a 100 percent tariff on chips and semiconductors imported into the United States, but with a major exception.
<br/>

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987864" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/m2-macbook-air-blue.jpeg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Companies that are building in the United States, or that have made a commitment to build in the U.S., will not have to pay the tariffs. Since Apple pledged <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/06/apple-american-manufacturing-program/">to spend $600 billion</a> on U.S. manufacturing, the company will presumably be exempted from the planned chip tariffs.
<br/>
<br/>
"If you're building in the United States, or made a commitment to build or are in the process, there's no charge," Trump said. He added that if companies promise to bring manufacturing to the U.S. and don't follow through, tariffs will be "added up" and "charged at a later date."
