            <b>Published:</b> 2024-08-19 08:40:45-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18, currently in beta, Apple is allowing iPhone users to replace the flashlight and camera buttons on the Lock Screen with something more useful, or to make them disappear entirely.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954622" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-lock-screen-buttons.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
The dedicated flashlight and camera shortcuts you see at the bottom of your iPhone's Lock Screen were introduced in their current form with the release of iOS 11 alongside the iPhone X in 2018, and the two icons have since been a staple, non-customizable feature.
<br/>
<br/>
But that's all set to change this September with the launch of iOS 18. The Lock Screen buttons on your iPhone can now be replaced with any Control Center option. This includes system features like Dark Mode, Airplane Mode, Accessibility options, Calculator, and Translate, as well as Shortcuts – making the functional possibilities endless.

The decision comes at a time when many companies in the digital art space, such as Adobe, are rapidly integrating AI capabilities into their products and services. Procreate's stance is grounded in a commitment to preserving what it describes as the "humanity" of creative work. The company issued a statement on its website that expressed strong reservations about the impact of generative AI on the creative process:<blockquote>Generative AI is ripping the humanity out of things.

            Apple's rumored tabletop robot has been spotted in its global supply chain for the first time, Taiwan's <a href="https://udn.com/news/story/7240/8170073"><em>United Daily News</em></a> reports.

Apple has apparently chosen Hongzhun to play a critical role in the development of the forthcoming device. Specifically, the supplier will be responsible for developing key mechanical components and casings for the tabletop robot. Once the product moves into mass production, Hongzhun will be tasked with producing the mechanical parts on a large scale. Hongzhun is a subsidiary of Foxconn, a longstanding manufacturing partner of Apple.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-08-16 04:40:38-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            After a four-year absence, <em>Fortnite</em> is making its return to iPhones – but only for users in the European Union. This comeback is part of the broader launch of the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/mobile/ios">Epic Games Store for iPhone</a>, which went live today in the EU.
<br/>

<br/>
The return of <em>Fortnite</em> to iOS comes as a result of the EU's Digital Markets Act, which has forced Apple to allow third-party app marketplaces on its platform. Users in the EU can now download the Epic Games Store by <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/mobile/ios">visiting Epic's website</a> on their iPhones.
<br/>
<br/>
<em>Fortnite</em>'s availability is undoubtedly the headline feature of the Epic Games Store launch. The popular battle royale game was removed from the App Store in &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/202 [...]<br>

            It's almost September, but Apple still has multiple new product launches planned for 2024. New <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models and Apple Watches are coming in September, and we're also going to get at least three Mac updates with M4 chips this year, according to rumors.

Apple plans to refresh both the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, adding M4 chips. The MacBook Pro lineup was last updated in October 2023, so the machines are due for a yearly refresh.

Apple did away with the 13-inch MacBook Pro last year, so there's now an entry-level 14-inch model, and that's what's going to get the standard M4 chip that was used in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">i</a> [...]<br>

            With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, Apple is requiring users to regularly reauthorize permissions for screen recording apps, a move that has not been popular with some Mac users.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today stopped signing iOS 17.6, preventing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users from downgrading to that version of iOS. The update is no longer being signed after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/07/apple-releases-ios-17-6-1/">released iOS 17.6.1 on August 7</a>.

<br/>
Apple regularly stops signing older version of iOS, typically within a week or two after a new version is released. When Apple stops signing an update, it can no longer be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side software verification check, so those who have updated to the latest version of iOS cannot downgrade.
<br/>
<br/>
Preventing downgrading encourages users to keep their operating systems up to date with the latest security fixes.
