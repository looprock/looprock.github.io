            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Sonos is developing a high-end streaming set-top box that's expected to launch this year, reports <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/sonos/606025/sonos-pinewood-video-player-features">The Verge</a></em>. While any set-top box will compete with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, Sonos plans to price its upcoming device at $200 to $400, which would make it notably more expensive than the ‌Apple TV‌.

<br/>
According to <em>The Verge</em>, the hardware is a nondescript black box that's slightly thicker than a deck of cards, with an included remote control. It'll run a version of Android, but Sonos has developed a "beautiful" interface.

The Lightning Digital AV Adapter is more than just a dongle, because it has an SoC inside and it runs a super simple version of iOS.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is fighting to defend its multi-billion dollar search engine deal with Google as Google is prosecuted for antitrust violations, and so far, the court isn't making it easy. Last week, Apple filed a motion for an emergency stay that would give the Cupertino company time to intervene in the lawsuit, but the judge overseeing the case denied Apple's motion [<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1160.0.pdf">PDF</a>] and won't hold off on moving forward.

In November, Apple asked the court to allow it to be more involved in the case as the court decides what steps to take to prevent Google from continuing to violate antitrust law.
