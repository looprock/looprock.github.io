            <b>Published:</b> 2023-12-06 12:05:43-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is doing away with the redundant iTunes Movies and iTunes TV Show apps on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> starting with the tvOS 17.2 update. As noted by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/12/06/itunes-movies-and-tv-shows-app-discontinued-apple-tv/">9to5Mac</a></em>, in the release candidate version of tvOS 17.2, opening up those apps redirects users to the ‌Apple TV‌ app.

<br/>
The ‌Apple TV‌ app supports both movie and TV show purchases, making the old iTunes Movies and iTunes TV Shows apps unnecessary and also confusing to some ‌Apple TV‌ users.
<br/>
<br/>
"iTunes Movies and Your Purchases Have Moved," reads the text in the iOS 17.2 release candidate. "You can buy or rent movies and find your purchases in the ‌Apple TV‌ app."

PostgreSQL has taken a complex problem and solved it to such an effective degree that all of its competitors are essentially obsolete, perhaps with the exception of SQLite.

In a letter to the Department of Justice, Senator Ron Wyden said foreign officials were demanding the data from the tech giants to track smartphones.

<br/>
Though the game was first released in 2022, it has been limited to Windows machines and PlayStation and Xbox consoles until today.

In this third-person adventure title, a stray cat's curiosity causes him to get stuck in a walled city filled with robots and mutant bacteria, and the aim in the game is to get back up to the surface using B-12, the cat's drone companion.

Stray asks players to solve puzzles, bypass obstacles, and complete quests while avoiding security bots and evil bacteria. The game is platform-based, so players will need to climb up various obstacles and interact with the environment to open up new pathways.
