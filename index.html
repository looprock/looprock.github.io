TUAW <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/30/aohell/">was shut down</a> and the site was folded into <em>Engadget</em> way back in 2015, but this month, a zombie TUAW website reappeared.

As it turns out, the TUAW domain name was purchased by a Hong Kong-based advertising agency, and it now hosts stolen content rewritten using AI. TUAW started posting AI-generated content earlier this week, with all of it stolen from sites like <em>MacRumors</em> and <em>9to5Mac</em>.

            Apple's Vision Pro spatial computing headset has yet to sell 100,000 units in the quarter since it launched in the U.S. in February, according to market tracker IDC (via <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-11/apple-s-vision-pro-won-t-cross-500-000-sales-this-year-idc-says">Bloomberg</a></em>).

<br/>
The device is projected to see a 75% drop in domestic sales in the current quarter, but the launch of Vision Pro internationally this month is expected to offset that decline.
