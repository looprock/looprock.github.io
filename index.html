            <p>I’ve hosted a lot of executive dinners for work - maybe 50 or 60 over the past several years…? These are commercial oriented. At <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com?utm_source=cote&amp;utm_campaign=devrel&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_content=newsletter20240621">my work</a>, we’re trying to meet new people to sell our software to, or people who know people, etc. Getting to know “executives” is directly related to the sales process. The secondary goal is more brand and thought-leadership marketing: just making the attendee aware of us and what we do, and, hopefully, our “vibe.” And the priorities after those two are what you’d expect: networking, fun/useful conversation, and doing some overall “community management” and participation. </p><p>Here’s some behind the curtain stuff on doing them, especially targeted at people like me who don’t like group conversations. I’ll skip over the “sales” tactics I use&lt;a class="footnote-anchor" href="https://cote.io/feed.xml#footnote-1" id="footnote-anchor-1" target="_</p> [...]<br>

But here’s the million-dollar question: Will the driver you are paired with, arrive at the estimated time? One of Lyft’s most simple, yet profound goals is to ensure we provide riders with the most accurate ETAs we can.</p><p>Before you even hit ‘request’ and summon a ride, there are complex algorithms that sift through historical and real-time data, leveraging machine learning alongside traffic and weather insights to predict the ETA (or pickup time) to display on the rider’s screen based on the destination they input. This got us thinking — how do we determine ETA estimates as accurately as possible, before a rider requests a ride?</p><p>Enter: <strong><em>Reliability</em></strong></p><h3>What does ‘<strong><em>reliable</em></strong></h3> [...]<br>
