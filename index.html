            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/">macOS Tahoe</a> 26.4 beta that Apple released today includes a Charge Limit feature for the Mac. There is a new slider bar that lets Mac users select a charge level from 80 percent to 100 percent.

<br/>
The Charge Limit is a setting that's available in addition to Optimized Battery Charging, and it can prevent a Mac from ever charging to 100 percent.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple's existing Optimized Battery Charging feature keeps a Mac from charging to 100 percent until it's needed for use, with the option using your daily charging routine to determine when to charge to full. While Optimized Battery Charging can help preserve battery life, it still regularly allows a Mac to charge to 100 percent.

<br/>
Apple removed the compact tab bar option with the launch of ‌macOS Tahoe‌ and iPadOS 26.4, but there were Mac and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> users who missed it.
<br/>
<br/>
The Safari app on Mac and the Safari section of the Settings app on ‌iPad‌ both now feature an option to toggle on the Compact Tab Bar as an alternative to the standard Separate Tab Bar.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The iOS 26.4 update that Apple is beta testing includes a new "Playlist Playground" feature in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> app that's designed to let users create a playlist with a text-based prompt.

<br/>
In the ‌Apple Music‌ app, there's an option to type in an idea and get automatic song suggestions for a playlist. Apple has some pre-set suggestions that include "morning coffee music," "hip-hop party songs," and "disco songs that defined the 1970s," but you can type in any idea, mood, or feeling.
<br/>
<br/>
From there, the Playlist Playground feature will automatically generate a list of 25 songs, along with a custom title. Playlists that you create can be customized further with additional text prompts, and you can select a cover and a description.

            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/">macOS Tahoe</a> will be the last version of macOS that supports Intel-based Macs, with Apple planning to phase out Intel Macs entirely following its transition to Apple silicon.

<br/>
Apple today reminded developers and users that future versions of macOS will not support Intel machines, and Rosetta 2 support for apps will end after macOS 27.
<br/>
<br/>
Starting with ‌macOS Tahoe‌ 26.4, when users launch an app that uses Rosetta 2, there will be a popup letting them know that the app will no longer work when support for Rosetta 2 ends.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that it will continue to support older, unmaintained gaming titles with Rosetta along with software running Intel binaries in Linux VMs beyond macOS 27. There could also be future security fixes.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today seeded the first betas of upcoming iOS 26.4 and iPadOS 26.4 updates to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming less than a week after Apple released iOS 26.3 and iPadOS 26.3.

<br/>
Registered developers can download the betas from the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> by going to the General section and selecting Software Update.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26.4 and iPadOS 26.4 could be significant updates that will introduce several new features. We were counting on the betas to include the smarter, more personalized version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> that Apple first debuted at WWDC 2024, but Apple has  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today provided the first beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/">macOS Tahoe</a> 26.4 update to developers for testing purposes, with the update coming just a few days after Apple launched ‌macOS Tahoe‌ 26.3.

<br/>
Developers can download the ‌macOS Tahoe‌ 26.4 update by opening up the System Settings app, selecting the General category, and then choosing Software Update. Beta Updates will need to be enabled, and a free developer account is required.
<br/>
<br/>
‌macOS Tahoe‌ 26.4 could introduce some new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> features, though at least some of the capabilities that we were expecting have been delayed. The update is also expected to introduce new emoji characters.

            Apple today provided developers with the first betas of upcoming watchOS 26.4, tvOS 26.4, and visionOS 26.4 betas for testing purposes. The software comes a few days after Apple launched the 26.3 versions of each platform.

The software updates are available through the Settings app on each device, and because these are developer betas, a free developer account is required.
<br/>

The updates are expected to introduce new emoji characters, plus there could be new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> capabilities, but we don't know exactly what's in the software as of yet.

Apple will likely provide public beta testers with access to the tvOS 26.4 and watchOS 26.4 betas later this month, but visionOS 26.4 will remain limited to developers. The softwa [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2026-02-16 08:40:13-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> is likely to be left for years without a major update, according to a reliable leaker.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-949554" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPad-Pro-M4-Silver-and-Space-Black-Feature-1.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
The Weibo-based leaker, known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a>," says that the ‌iPad Pro‌ will not have a major update for a prolonged period of time. The cost of the OLED panel now used in the device is unlikely to come down in price and the last major redesign apparently did not significantly stimulate sales growth. 
<br/>
<br/>
While Apple may maintain a regular iteration cycle with the device, it apparently has no intention of pursuing significant upgrades such as ultra-slim borders around the display, the likes of which are available on rival high-end tablets.

            Apple today announced a "special Apple Experience" in New York, London, and Shanghai, taking place on March 4, 2026 at 9:00am ET.

<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1036438" height="1235" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/Apple-Announces-Special-Event-in-New-York-Feature.jpg" width="2196"/>
<br/>
<br/>
Apple invited select members of the media to the event in three major cities around the world. It is simply described as a "special Apple Experience," and there is no further information about what it may entail. The invitation features a 3D Apple logo design composed of yellow, green, and blue discs.
<br/>
<br/>
It is notable that Apple is specifically using the word "experience," rather than "event." Unlike a full live-streamed event from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a>, the March 4 event in other cities is likely to be smaller in scale.

The effort is said to be similar to what Apple did with its Snow Leopard Mac update years ago, and will involve removing old code, rewriting existing features, and subtly upgrading apps to improve their performance.

The result should hopefully be a "snappier, more responsive" OS, says Gurman. Apple is also reportedly planning some interface tweaks, but nothing as dramatic as the Liquid Glass overhaul introduced with iOS 26, which will likely  [...]<br>
