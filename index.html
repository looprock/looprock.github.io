            The second part of the article explores GitOps in detail, focusing on challenges related to managing multiple environments, handling values and secrets, comparing GitOps with CI Ops, and assessing its practical application. GitOps suggests having a single environment and advises against multiple stages within its scope, while valuesFiles and valuesFrom are considered for environment-specific configurations. Managing secrets involves avoiding plaintext storage, using tools like SOPS or Sealed Secrets, or employing external secret stores like HashiCorp Vault. The article compares GitOps and CI Ops in terms of security, rollback procedures, and managing multiple clusters, highlighting that GitOps introduces complexity and challenges often "out of GitOps scope." Ultimately, GitOps is viewed as not substantially advantageous over well-organized CI Ops, demanding several extra components and accounts.

<p id="SGsiy9">Google is adding a new feature to the next release of Chrome that will proactively alert you when an extension isn’t in the Chrome Web Store, according to <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/extension-safety-hub/">a post</a> from Oliver Dunk, a developer relations engineer for Chrome extensions. The new feature, being added as part of Chrome 117, will make it easier to stay on top of extensions that have been removed by a developer, been taken down for violating the Chrome Web Store policies, or been marked as malware.</p>

            Apple is expected to release <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> in mid to late September as a free software update for the iPhone XS and newer. The update includes a wide range of new features, but not all of them will be available right away, according to <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-17-preview/">Apple's website</a>.

<br/>
Below, we have listed three features that Apple says are "coming later this year" as part of a future iOS 17 version, such as iOS 17.1 or iOS 17.2. Apple has already been testing iOS 17.1 internally for several weeks, according to our <em>MacRumors</em> analytics logs, and the update is likely to be released in late October based on precedent.
