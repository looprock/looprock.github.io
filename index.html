In a statement provided to <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-slams-metas-numerous-interoperability-requests-2024-12-18/">Reuters</a></em>, Apple said that Meta is asking for changes that could compromise user security and privacy.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            OpenAI today announced support for a new phone-based ChatGPT experience, which can be accessed by calling or texting 1-800-ChatGPT (1-800-242-8478). The feature was introduced as part of OpenAI's ongoing 12 days of OpenAI event.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The 1-800-ChatGPT phone number is designed for situations where a data connection is unavailable, but a cellular connection works. With the feature, ChatGPT can provide answers to questions over the phone with voice-based responses, and even landlines are supported. Texting ChatGPT can be done through WhatsApp using the same number, but images and videos aren't supported at this time.

Any U.S. phone number can contact ChatGPT and get 15 minutes of response time for free without an OpenAI account, but downloading the app and creating an account allows for additional call time.

Priced at $20, TimeCapsule is an ‌AirTag‌ enclosure that houses two AA batteries that offer 14x more battery capacity than the CR2032 battery that the ‌AirTag‌ runs on.

<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Robot Vacuum Support in Home App</h2>
<br/>
First, tvOS 18.3 will add robot vacuum support to the Home app on the Apple TV, based on code-level references to the feature in the first beta.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's subsidiaries in France and Belgium have had criminal complaints filed against them by the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is accusing the tech giant of using conflict minerals in its product supply chain (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/congo-files-criminal-complaints-against-apple-europe-over-conflict-minerals-2024-12-17/">Reuters</a></em>).

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-12-17 03:16:04-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's latest macOS Sequoia 15.2 update has introduced a critical bug that prevents the popular backup utility <a href="https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper</a> from creating bootable backups, according to the app's chief developer, Shirt Pocket's <a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/youre_a_mean_one/">Dave Nanian</a>.

<br/>
The issue stems from a "Resource Busy" error that occurs during the final stages of the backup process when attempting to copy system preboot or recovery files. While similar errors in the past could be resolved by keeping the system awake during backup, Ninian reports that this new bug appears to be more fundamental.

The problem originates from Apple's earlier decision to restrict third-party apps from directly copying the opera [...]<br>
