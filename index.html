            At various points in Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/102/">Platforms State of the Unions video</a> for developers, a Vision Pro headset with a USB-C adapter attached to the right side of the headset can be seen, leading to some speculation <a href="https://twitter.com/M1Astra/status/1666273487017631744">on social media</a> as to what the adapter is for.

It appears that the adapter has a USB-C cable leading to a Mac Studio <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/102/?time=4693">in one shot</a>, although there is no definitive view to confirm this. In this scenario, it is possible the adapter could provide a direct connection to a Mac for visionOS app development in Xcode, but the adapter's purpose ultimately remains a mystery for now.

VPN apps could allow for Apple TV users to watch geo-restricted content from any location, such as the U.S. version of Netflix in another country. In its tvOS 17 press release, however, Apple focused on how the VPN apps can benefit enterprise and education users, so it is possible that Apple could restrict usage of the apps.

The additional strap is presumably used to better disperse weight and/or keep the headset from being easily dislodged when the wearer is moving around.

            There have been lots of legal battles fought over proprietary blends of numbers and letters. States collecting a premium for vanity plates claim this is government speech, since it&#8217;s a state-issued plate.

Selig <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/31/reddit-api-changes-pricing-apollo/">said in late May</a> that Reddit is charging $12,000 for 50 million requests, and given the number of people that use Apollo, that would result in a $20 million per year charge that is unfeasible for Selig to pay.
