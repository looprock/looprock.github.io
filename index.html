<p>The Feature Systems team at Etsy is responsible for the platform and services through which machine learning (ML) practitioners create, manage and consume feature data for their machine learning models. We recently made new real-time features available through our streaming feature platform, Rivulet, where we return things like ‚Äúmost recent add-to-carts.‚Äù While timeseries data itself wasn‚Äôt new to our system, these newer features from our streaming feature service would be the first timeseries inputs to be supplied to our ML models themselves to inform search, ads, and recommendations use cases.</p>
<p>Not too long after we made these features available to users for ML model training, we received a message from Harshal, an ML practitioner on Recommendations, warning us of "major problems" lying in wait.

<br/>
It's worth noting from the off that widgets can still be parked in Notification Center, but now they can also be dragged out onto the desktop.
