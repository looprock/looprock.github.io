            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Just days ahead of WWDC, where Apple is expected to unveil its long-rumored AR/VR headset, developer Steve Troughton-Smith has <a href="https://mastodon.social/@stroughtonsmith/110455368975767191">managed to trick App Store Connect</a> into showing the headset's rumored "xrOS" operating system name.

App Store Connect rejected the app, but recognized it as an xrOS binary in an error message, despite Troughton-Smith never mentioning xrOS.

Hello Games missed that deadline and the game has yet to release for Apple devices, meaning that the two emoji teasers could indicate that the launch of No Man's Sky for the ‌iPad‌ and Mac is now imminent.

<br/>
In iOS, many apps display a different view when you rotate your iPhone from portrait to landscape orientation. Depending on the app and the way you use it, this behavior isn't always desirable, which is why Apple includes the Orientation Lock option in Control Center.

<br/>
<br/>
If you tend to keep the lock on, you have to disable it in Control Center each time you open these kinds of apps to get the fullscreen experience. Then when you close the app, you have to r [...]<br>
