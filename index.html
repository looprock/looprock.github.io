            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple CEO Tim Cook was among a handful of top tech executives who attended a classified CIA briefing warning that China could attack Taiwan by 2027, according to a sweeping investigative report by <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/24/technology/taiwan-china-chips-silicon-valley-tsmc.html">The New York Times</a></em> ($).

<br/>
The previously unreported briefing was apparently held in a secure room in Silicon Valley in July 2023.

            Apple shipped 36.9 million iPhones in Europe in 2025, a 6% year-over-year growth which allowed the company to claim a record 27% share of the region's smartphone market, according to new research from analytics firm <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260223195692/ja?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-bV7DTIYheT0D-1vT4_bKFzt_EW40VMdK6eG-WLfRGUE1fJraLPL1g6AeUGJlCTYs7Oafol48Kkc8KJgZoTHgMu0w8LYSbRdYOj2VdwnuKwa">Omdia</a>.

The gains came even as the broader European smartphone market declined by 1% to 134.2 million units, which Omdia says was weighed down by softer demand and new regulations around eco-design requirements and mandatory USB-C ports.

Last month, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/apple-releases-ios-26-2-1/">released iOS 26.2.1</a> with bug fixes and support for the second-generation AirTag. Likewise, it is possible that iOS 26.3.1 will include support for some of the new products that Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/22/five-new-apple-products-next-week/">expected to announce in the first week of March</a>, such as the iPhone 17e, but this is merely speculation at this point.

A week ago, Apple invited selected journalists and content creators to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/apple-announces-special-event-in-new-york/">"Apple Experience" in New York, London, and Shanghai</a> on Wednesday, March 4 at 9 a.m. Eastern Time.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The special new color that Apple is considering for the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max this year is red, according <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-22/apple-s-ai-wearables-push-what-to-expect-from-march-4-low-end-macbook-launch">to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

<br/>
Specifically, he said that Apple is testing a "deep red" finish for the two devices.
<br/>
<br/>
If this rumor materializes, it would be the first time that the Pro and Pro Max models ever come in red, and the iPhone 18 Pro models would be the first iPhone models to be available in red since the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-continues-to-abandon-productred/">(PRODUCT)RED</a>. However, it sounds like it would be more of a burgundy finish than a bright red.

            <b>Published:</b> 2026-02-22 10:22:00+01:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Most organizations treat infrastructure as a series of projects to be &ldquo;completed,&rdquo; but successful platform engineering requires a permanent product mindset. In this episode, we explore why platform teams need dedicated product management to balance competing priorities—like security, cost, and developer experience—and why the &ldquo;why&rdquo; scales much better than the &ldquo;what&rdquo; in large enterprises. We also dive into the often-overlooked role of designers in creating platform tools that developers actually want to use.</p>
<p>Tanzu Catsup is a weekly conversation about platform engineering, cloud-native operations, and building software in large organizations. We follow the work wherever it actually leads.</p>

<p>Andreessen specifically predicted that Salesforce would disrupt Oracle. Fourteen years later, Oracle is roughly 2.5x the size of Salesforce. Salesforce sells application logic – workflows, configurations, business rules. Oracle sells infrastructure – databases, middleware, cloud compute. The application layer was always the vulnerable part. The infrastructure layer was always the durable part. Software ate the world. Then it sat around all gluttonous and bloated.

<p>It is especially bad when you hook it up to other services like docs and email.</p>
