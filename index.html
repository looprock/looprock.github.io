            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Whether your iPhone or iPad is long overdue a battery replacement, or you just want to get more juice out of a single charge, here's a way to keep your device's Low Power Mode on all the time.
<br/>

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-858446" height="940" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/08/ios-16-battery-low-power-mode-beta-6.jpg" width="1500"/>
<br/>
Most ‌iPhone‌ and iPad users will be familiar with the way their device throws up a prompt to turn on Low Power Mode when the battery falls to 20 percent. The special mode conserves what remaining battery life the device has left by limiting some features, but by default the mode automatically turns off when a charging iPhone or iPad reaches 80 percent. If that irks you, don't worry – there is a solution.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you're running the latest version of iOS or iPadOS on an older device and you've found that the battery life is inadequate to get you through the day. Or maybe you just want to reduce the amount [...]<br>

            <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threads-an-instagram-app/id6446901002">Threads</a>, Meta's alternative to Twitter, has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/05/instagram-threads-app-now-available/">officially launched</a>. But users thinking of installing the social media app just to check it out should be aware that you can't delete your Threads profile without also deleting your Instagram account.

<br/>
Meta describes Threads as "Instagram's text-based conversation app," and there's purpose in that precise phrasing. It doesn't just mean that your Instagram username ports over to Threads and that you have the option to follow the same people you follow on Instagram. It also means that once you create a Threads profile, there's no way to delete it unless you're prepared to delete your Instagram account wholesale.
