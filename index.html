            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-26 08:53:38-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, Apple Intelligence makes the Wallet app's order tracking feature genuinely useful by scanning your email for shipping details. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1013341" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/ios-26-beta-5-wallet-app.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
The ability to track orders in Apple Wallet isn't new – it's actually been around since iOS 16. But if you've never noticed it before, don't worry. Most people haven't used it either.
<br/>
<br/>
The feature initially struggled because it relied on merchants to actively support it, but not many bothered. In fact, despite being available for years, order tracking in Apple's Wallet app remained largely unused. But there's a decent chance iOS 26 will change all that.

In ‌iOS 26‌, you can copy just part of a text message, rather than having to copy the whole thing. It's useful if someone sends you a web link, an address, or something else where you only need to copy part of what you're sent.
