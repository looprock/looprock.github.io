<br/>
The claim originates from the leaker known as "Majin Bu," who posted an image and description of the alleged change on <a href="https://x.com/majinbuofficial/status/1938945546556977532?s=61">social media</a> and their <a href="https://t.co/xeC6d0oBeN">personal blog</a>. According to Bu, the Apple logo will move to be noticeably lower on the ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌, closer to the bottom-center of the device's rear. The shift is apparently necessitated by the new, full-width camera bar that is expected to span the entire width of the back [...]<br>

            Chinese display manufacturer BOE is aggressively ramping up its OLED production capacity for future <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models as part of a plan to recapture a major role in Apple's supply chain.

<br/>
In May 2022, Apple halted BOE's inclusion in the ‌iPhone‌ 13's supply chain after detecting unauthorized design modifications. The crisis began when BOE, facing component shortages and yield issues, expanded the circuit width of thin-film transistors in its panels without Apple's approval. When Apple discovered this, Apple instructed BOE to halt production.
<br/>
<br/>
Since then, BOE has gradually sought to return to Apple's good graces. The company was later granted approval to resume supplying OLED panels for the ‌iPhone‌ 14, albeit in limited quantities. Acc [...]<br>
