The ‌iPhone SE‌ debuted in 2016 as Apple's answer to customers who wanted a more affordable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> without sacrificing key features. The first SE model was based on the design of the ‌iPhone‌ 5s but packed the then-flagship A9 chip and latest camera technology. Subsequent iterations followed a similar formula: the second-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ in 2020 adopted the ‌iPhone‌ 8's design and added the A13 Bionic chip, while the third generation launched in 2022 with another leap in processing power thanks to [...]<br>

Speaking to lawmakers on Tuesday, Roeslani said the government expects to receive a written commitment from Apple within a week.

            A UK class action lawsuit against Apple over App Store commission fees will proceed after judges dismissed the company's attempt to block the case, <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-03/apple-faces-uk-class-action-over-app-store-commission-charges">Bloomberg</a></em> reports.

<br/>
Led by competition policy professor Sean Ennis, the suit alleges Apple's 15-30% commission on App Store sales creates an anti-competitive tax on the UK technology industry. The lawsuit seeks £785 million ($995 million) in damages on behalf of UK app developers. The case could potentially benefit up to 13,000 developers who have sold apps or in-app subscriptions to iOS users since July 2017.

            Next year's iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will feature a titanium chassis just like the current Pro models, contrary to reports of Apple adopting aluminum across its 2025 lineup, claims the Weibo leaker known as "Instant Digital."

<br/>
Last month, <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/first-iphone-17-pro-design-leak/">reported</a> that Apple's two flagship ‌iPhone 17‌ Pro models would be the first high-end iPhones to feature an aluminum frame since the delineation of the iPhone lineup into Pro and non-Pro models. 
<br/>
<br/>
Prior to the iPhone 15 Pro, high-end ‌iPhone‌ models used stainless steel frames. Then Apple introduced a titanium chassis to the iPhone 15 Pro, touting it as a major upgrade. However, Ma reports that with the ‌iPhone 17‌ lineup, Apple is planning to t [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has quietly tweaked its Home app webpage to indicate that its upcoming robot vacuum control feature will now arrive in early 2025 rather than later this year, as previously advertised. 
<br/>

<br/>
When support is added, Apple device users will be able to start a robot vacuum via HomeKit automations and scenes, or ask Siri to clean a specific room. Apple says the Home app will support the "core functionality" of robot vacuum cleaners, such as vacuuming, mopping, power control, cleaning mode, and charge status.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WhatsApp is set to end support for iOS versions older than iOS 15.1 from May next year, removing the chat platform's compatibility with several iPhone models in the process.

<br/>
From May 5, 2025, WhatsApp will no longer be compatible with iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus models. Users with those devices won't be able to access the encrypted chat service after the specified date unless they upgrade their iPhone.
<br/>
<br/>
Users who intend to upgrade can back up their WhatsApp chats to iCloud, and restore their full chat and media history to a newer, supported device using using WhatsApp's Chat Transfer feature.
