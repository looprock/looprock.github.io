            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple this week got sued in a New Jersey Federal court by the maker of mobile video app Camo, alleging Apple stole its technology when the company integrated its Continuity Camera feature into iOS 16 in 2022.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-848371" height="1276" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/continuity-camera.jpg" width="1930"/>
<br/>
Released by London-based Reincubate in 2020, the Camo app enables iPhone and Android smartphones to be used as webcams for desktop-based video calls. 
<br/>
<br/>
Apple's Continuity Camera serves a similar function within its own ecosystem, allowing an iPhone to be used as a wireless webcam with a nearby Mac that is signed into the same Apple Account.
<br/>
<br/>
Reincubate said the tech giant copied patented features from its Camo app and incorporated them into its mobile operating system in order to "redirect user demand to Apple's own platform-tied offering."
<br/>

According to the lawsuit, Apple "activ [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has released a carrier settings update for Telstra customers in Australia that resolves the issue affecting iPhones running iOS 16.7.13, which was released and then made unavailable to download by Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/28/apple-stops-signing-newly-released-ios-updates/">earlier this week</a>.

<br/>
The fix is delivered via a carrier bundle update, which adjusts network-related settings such as connectivity and calling features, without requiring an iOS update. 
<br/>
<br/>
Affected users who updated to iOS 16.7.13 before Apple stopped signing it can install the bundle on their iPhone by going to Settings ➝ General ➝ About, where a prompt to update carrier settings should appear. Once installed, the Service Provider field in Settings should display "Telstra 54.1," said the telecommunications co [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has signed a deal with popular fantasy author Brandon Sanderson for film and TV rights to Sanderson's "Cosmere" universe, according to <em><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/brandon-sandersons-mistborn-stormlight-archive-movie-tv-1236487271/">The Hollywood Reporter</a></em>.

<br/>
Sanderson has a large body of work, but some of his most popular fantasy books could be adapted first. Mistborn could be turned into a movie series, while The Stormlight Archive is being considered for television. Mistborn is a book series that's split into two eras, with the first three books featuring a group of magic-using metal manipulators or "Allomancers" overthrowing a dystopian empire. The second set of books follows the exploits of Wax and Wayne, two lawmen with magical abilities in a more modern setting.

Those CIOs are incentivized to optimize for efficiency, not growth. The result is predictable: Tech-led AI strategies deliver productivity improvements, but not transformation.

That leadership gap bleeds over into the measurement of AI value.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, I’m sure that at least some of you are shaking your heads and thinking, I’m saying we have to all build our own PaaS. Haven’t we been there before with platforms as a service? But I am absolutely not suggesting that we walk up to Sisyphus, give a big high five and go, “Let’s grab that boulder and push it up the hill of our internal platform as a service.” It’s not about rebuilding what we can purchase that is available on the market. It’s about making sure we spend our time building the things that are bespoke and important for our organization. It’s so we can depend on platforms like these products and more to build on top of because an internal platform is bespoke to your business. It is always striving to fill the space between what you can buy from the market and what your teams demand to be effective. Said</p></blockquote> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Kubernetes memory limits introduce a subtle but critical interaction with the Go runtime that can determine whether a service runs efficiently or fails under load. This article explores how Go manages memory under normal conditions and what changes when Kubernetes enforces hard memory constraints. Using controlled load testing, it shows why Go is generally excellent at self regulating memory, how OOM events emerge once limits are imposed, and how tools like GOMEMLIMIT can be used to align the runtime with container boundaries. Originally published in July 2024, the guidance remains highly relevant for teams running Go services in containerized environments where stability and throughput are tightly coupled to memory configuration.</p><br>
