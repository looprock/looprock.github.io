            In iOS 26, Apple's Spatial Scenes feature can transform ordinary photos into dynamic, three-dimensional pictures that respond to your movements. By adding depth and subtle motion to flat images, this clever AI-powered feature can bring to life photos in your iPhone's library – and your iPhone doesn't need Apple Intelligence to make use of it.

Spatial Scenes works by intelligently separating subjects from backgrounds in your photos. When you move your iPhone, the foreground elements stay relatively stable while background elements shift slightly. This creates a parallax effect that mimics how your eyes naturally perceive depth.

The feature works using generative AI that analyzes your photos to identify different elements and create depth maps. Importantly, it doe [...]<br>

            Apple has redesigned the hardware underpinning the Dynamic Island on the upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models, shrinking the pill-shaped cutout with a more compact front-facing camera and sensor system, if a last-minute rumor is anything to go by.

The leak comes from a <a href="https://x.com/that_one_g3/status/1963528486892581087">previously unknown source</a> who claims to work for a company that makes iPhone screen protectors.

Given the source's lack of track record, we are taking this rumor with a large chunk of salt. Having said that, we wanted to cover it because there have been persistent – albeit conflicting – rumors that Apple planned to reduce the size of the Dynamic Island starting  [...]<br>

            We have just a few more days to go until Apple's September 9 "Awe Dropping" event that will see the introduction of the Apple Watch Series 11. No design changes are expected this year, but there could be some internal updates.

<br/>
<h2 id="updated_modem">Updated Modem</h2>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Series 11 is rumored to be getting a MediaTek modem that supports 5G RedCap, a 5G service designed for wearables that don't need standard 5G speeds. 5G RedCap should still bring speed improvements over the LTE that's in the current Series 10.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="new_chip">New Chip</h2>
<br/>
Apple has a new S11 chip in store for the Series 11, but it will have the same processor as the Series 10. We're not expecting speed improvements, but the chip could be smaller, providing more space for other internal components.

            <p>Every day, shoppers from Etsy's community of nearly 90M buyers visit our marketplace to search for unique, handmade, and vintage items. But with over 100 million listings, how do we help each buyer find exactly what they're looking for? Traditional search and recommendation systems often fall short of capturing the nuanced interests that make each Etsy buyer unique, from specific styles to aesthetic preferences. At Etsy, understanding our buyers' interests is central to delivering engaging, personalized experiences. </p>
<p>Recently, we explored enhancing our personalization by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to create detailed buyer profiles based on buyers’ browsing and purchasing behaviors. We build these profiles in alignment with privacy laws and requirements such as the GDPR and the CCPA/CPRA. Buyers have the ability to opt-out, so that they can choose not to have a profile generated at all.</p>
