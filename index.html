            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-03 12:00:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Astropad today announced the launch of <a href="http://astropad.com/freshcoat">Fresh Coat</a>, a new anti-reflective screen protector that's designed to make the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> easier to see outdoors and under bright lights.

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1016727" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/astropad-fresh-coat-screen-protector.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
Fresh Coat is a glass screen protector that cuts down on up to 75 percent of reflections while preserving color accuracy.
<br/>
<br/>
We were able to try out Fresh Coat ahead of launch, and can confirm that it does indeed cut down on reflections without impacting the ‌iPhone‌'s color or display visibility, with no sign of haze. Astropad includes a tray that ensures a precise alignment and makes applying the screen protector foolproof, and it comes with an app clip that walks you through the installation process.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Every day, shoppers from Etsy's community of nearly 90M buyers visit our marketplace to search for unique, handmade, and vintage items. But with over 100 million listings, how do we help each buyer find exactly what they're looking for? Traditional search and recommendation systems often fall short of capturing the nuanced interests that make each Etsy buyer unique, from specific styles to aesthetic preferences. At Etsy, understanding our buyers' interests is central to delivering engaging, personalized experiences. </p>
<p>Recently, we explored enhancing our personalization by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to create detailed buyer profiles based on buyers’ browsing and purchasing behaviors. We build these profiles in strict alignment with privacy laws and agreements such as GDPR and CCPA. In addition, we will be providing buyers with a clear opt-out, so that they can choose not to have a profile generated at all.</p>

            Netflix today <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/netflix-moments">announced</a> an update to its Moments feature that lets users save and share favorite scenes as standalone clips, available now in the streaming service's iOS app.

The enhanced feature replaces the bookmark-style system and instead allows you to set both the start and end point when saving scenes, giving more precise control over which portions of a scene you want to preserve.

Whether you're a developer, writer, or content creator, this long-awaited feature should bridge the gap between your existing Markdown workflow and Apple's native note-taking app.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple will introduce four new iPhones next week, and the standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> will arguably be the least interesting of the bunch. It's not going to get the super slim design like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>, nor will it have the upgraded camera setup like the 17 Pro. There are still a handful of features to look forward to, though, which we've outlined below.
