            WhatsApp is planning to add passkey support to its iPhone app, according to code discovered <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1718985018322653224">by software researcher @aaronp613</a> in the latest beta version of the app.

<br/>
Passkey support would allow iPhone users to sign in to WhatsApp with Face ID, Touch ID, or the device's passcode. Passkeys are stored in iCloud Keychain. To use passkeys on the iPhone, the device must be updated to iOS 16 or later.
<br/>
<br/>
"Passkeys are more secure than passwords, because they're uniquely generated for every account by your own device, and are less vulnerable to phishing," <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/guide/iphone/iphf538ea8d0/ios">says</a> Apple.

Writing in the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, Gurman says Apple will replace the Lightning port for USB-C to comply with European regulations and for consistency across its AirPods lineup, but Apple does not plan to add the H2 chip and its attendant features like Adaptive Audio and Personalized Volume for the foreseeable future.

            Apple earlier this week surprised us with an unexpected October event, and curiously, it is set to take place on Monday, October 30 at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time. Apple has never hosted a nighttime event before, so Monday should be quite interesting.

<br/>
The "Scary Fast" event will be focused on the Mac, which has been confirmed by Apple's artwork for the event. On Apple's website, there is an Apple logo that morphs into the Mac Finder icon, so it's Macs that we're going to see.
<br/>
<br/>
Rumors have been mixed about what we can expect at the event, but it's sounding like we'll get the entire M3 chip lineup. We've outlined what we've heard is coming, but we might also get some unexpected announcements.

            <p>How Netflix’s Container Platform Connects Linux Kernel Panics to Kubernetes Pods</p><p><em>By Kyle Anderson</em></p><p>With a recent effort to reduce customer (engineers, not end users) pain on our container platform <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/tagged/titus">Titus</a>, I started investigating “orphaned” pods. There are pods that never got to finish and had to be garbage collected with no real satisfactory final status. Our Service job (think <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/">ReplicatSet</a>) owners don’t care too much, but our Batch users care a lot. Without a real return code, how can they know if it is safe to retry or not?</p><p>These orphaned pods represent real pain for our users, even if they are a small percentage of the total pods in the system. Where are they going, exactly? Why did they go away?</p><p>This blog post shows how to connect the dots from the worst case scenario (a kernel panic) through to Kubernetes (k8s) and eventually up to us </p> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>In 2014, someone in Korea requested that we add a <em>query_id</em> to <a class="txt2html" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-PG-STAT-ACTIVITY-VIEW" style="text-decoration: none;"><em>pg_stat_activity</em></a> to match the
<em>queryid</em> in <a class="txt2html" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html" style="text-decoration: none;"><em>pg_stat_statements.</em></a>  This would allow administrators to get duration estimates of currently running queries. 
<a class="txt2html" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/release-14.html#id-1.11.6.13.5" style="text-decoration: none;">Postgres 14</a> added this capability, so here is an example of it being used.  First, we must install <em>pg_stat_statements:</em>
</p>
<p><blockquote>
</blockquote></p><pre class="quote_explicit">
$ make -C contrib/pg_stat_statements install
 
$ psql test &lt;&lt;END
CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
