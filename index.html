            <b>Published:</b> 2025-07-30 06:21:05-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Skechers recently started selling a <a href="https://www.skechers.com/kids/collections-features/find-my-skechers/">line of kids shoes</a> that have a hidden compartment under the insole for inserting Apple's AirTag item tracker.

<br/>
The idea here is that parents can put an AirTag in the shoes, and then track the location of those shoes (and the child wearing them) in the Find My app, which is available across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and on the web at iCloud.com.
<br/>
<br/>
The shoes can provide parents with peace of mind by allowing them to keep track of their child's location in public. If a child gets lost in a busy shopping mall, for example, the parent could view their location in the Find My app. Or, a parent could double check that their child is where they are supposed to be at a certain time, such as s [...]<br>

            Apple's official Support account on China's Weibo had a serious case of mistaken identity on Tuesday after it accidentally posted a slick promotional trailer for Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip7.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
In the embarrassing mix-up, the uploaded video clearly promoted Samsung's latest flip-style clamshell device rather than any Apple-affiliated product. Video capturing the blunder circulated across social media before the post was quickly deleted.
<br/>
<br/>
As for who is responsible for the error, the going theory is that it is an outsourced agency that handles marketing assets for both Apple and Samsung in the region. In other words, someone probably grabbed the wrong video file and hit publish without double-checking the content.
