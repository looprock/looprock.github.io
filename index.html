            Over the last decade, increasing numbers of automated license plate readers (ALPR) have been installed on roads, bringing with them a variety of privacy problems, as Techdirt has reported. It’s easy to see why ALPR is popular with the authorities: license plate readers seem a simple way to monitor driving behavior and to catch people [&#8230;]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Shortly after the Vision Pro launched, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made it clear that he believes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/meta-quest-3-apple-vision-pro-zuckerberg/">Quest 3 is the better VR headset</a>, and over the weekend, he again <a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/C4Rrh9wrbU0">took to Threads</a> to reiterate his belief that the $3,500 Vision Pro is inferior to the $500 Quest 3 (via <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/03/11/zuckerberg-vision-pro-vs-meta-quest-3/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a>).

Analyst Benedict Evans said that the Vision Pro is the "device Meta wants to reach in 3-5 years," and that it is confusing that Meta VR engineers have suggested the Vision Pro is "basically just the same thing" as the Quest.

Sent out on an annual basis, VendorUI is a variant of iOS that is provided to factories for quality control testing. Because it has a pre-production version of the iOS user interface that Apple won't publicly unveil until WWDC, Apple is careful about where it is distributed.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The debate over whether 8GB of RAM is sufficient for a Mac has long been a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/8gb-ram-m3-macbook-pro-like-16-gb-pc/">topic of contention</a>. The controversy goes back to at least 2012, when Apple launched the first MacBook Pro with Retina display, which started with 8GB of RAM. Apple still offers 8GB as the base configuration for its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-m3-macbook-pros/">14-inch MacBook Pro</a>, not to mention its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">M3 iMac</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">latest MacBook Air</a> models. Coupled with the significant cost of upgrading to higher memory options, Apple's decision has once again sparked discussions about the adequacy and value of this configuration.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple appears to be internally testing iOS 17.4.1 for the iPhone, based on evidence of the software update in our website's logs this week.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940545" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-17.4.1-Feature-Joe-Blue.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Our logs have revealed the existence of several iOS 17 versions before Apple released them, ranging from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-preparing-ios-17-0-3/">iOS 17.0.3</a> to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/05/apple-preparing-ios-17-3-1/">iOS 17.3.1</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.4.1 should be a minor update that addresses software bugs and/or security vulnerabilities.
<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear when iOS 17.4.1 will be released, but the update's appearance in our logs suggests it will likely be available this week or next week.

Apple is also internally testing iOS 17.5, which should be available for beta testing soon.&lt;div class="lin [...]<br>

            AirPods Pro will gain a new "hearing aid mode" with the release of iOS 18 later this year, according to the latest report by <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> is still months away from being unveiled, but there are already several rumors and expectations for the software update, as outlined below.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909207" height="1266" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Feature-Baubles.jpg" width="2250"/>
<br/>
iOS 18 is rumored to include new ChatGPT-inspired generative AI features for Siri and many built-in apps, and Apple plans to add RCS support to the Messages app for an improved texting experience between iPhones and Android devices. The update is also rumored to have some design changes, but details remain slim.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 is expected to be announced at Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in June, and widely released in September.

            Apple's M3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models are in stores as of today, so we picked one up to test it out, see what's new, answer reader questions, and determine whether it's worth buying or upgrading to.

<br/>
The ‌MacBook Air‌ is available in 13.6-inch and 15.3-inch sizes, just like the prior-generation versions. Apple did not introduce notable design changes this time around, so most of what's new is on the inside.
<br/>
<br/>
An M3 chip is the main upgrade, and this is the same chip that Apple already used in the 14-inch MacBook Pro. When we benchmarked our test unit with an 8-core GPU and 10-core GPU, we got a Geekbench single-core score of 3106 and a multi-core score of 11690.

Paul shares insights on the future of the internet and how he’d reinvent DNS if given the opportunity. We even discuss the cultural idiom “It’s always DNS,” and the shift to using DNS resolvers like OpenDNS, Google’s 8.8.8.8 and Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1. Buckle up, this is a good one.<br>
