            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Device insurance provider Allstate Protection Plans today shared the results of one of its annual device drop tests, and this time around, the company broke some of the most expensive smartphones on the market, including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The drop and dunk tests included the $1,200 ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max, the $1,200 Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, the $1,799 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold5, and the $1,799 Google Pixel Fold. These are the most expensive smartphone options from Apple, Google, and Samsung, and all of these phones are constructed from glass.
<br/>
<br/>
For these tests, Allstate dunked each smartphone in water for 30 minutes and then dropped them onto a sidewalk from six feet up using an apparatus to drop them from the same height and angle.

As all of these smartphones have decent water resistance ratings, they were working fine following the dunk tes [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-10-09 11:32:15-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Samsung today joined Google in attempting to convince Apple to adopt the Rich Communication Services or RCS messaging standard that Google has been pushing.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
In a short ad that's a riff on Romeo and Juliet, Samsung features two smartphone interfaces texting each other. "Juliet" is the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> in the metaphor and her parents (aka Apple) won't allow for the adoption of RCS. "What did green ever do to them? We're bubbles too," laments the "Romeo" Android smartphone. "And literally everyone wants us to be together. Ugh," writes Juliet.
<br/>
<br/>
It's ultimately a bit of a confusing ad, but Samsung makes it clear with the title of the video: "Green bubbles and blue bubbles want to be together." Samsung also includes the "Help Apple #GetTheMessage" tagline and hashtag that Google has been using for its RCS campaign.

Google has been hounding Apple about adopting RCS for several years now usin [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-10-09 03:24:16-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touchscreen-mac/">Touchscreen Mac</a> rumors are not new, but it turns out that neither are touchscreen Macs. In 1999, a company called Elo produced and sold touchscreen versions of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> G3 through Apple's Value Added Reseller program for use as kiosk machines, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZGswRH4wbM">YouTuber Michael MJD</a> recently managed to get hold of one. 
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The "ready-to-go tabletop kiosks" featured Elo's own iTouch touch-on-tube interface, which used surface acoustic waves instead of an overlay to detect where users touched the screen. You can see a prototype Elo ‌iMac‌ in action in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZGswRH4wbM">Michael MJD's video</a>, which also covers the history of the machine as well as its technical specifications. Given the simplicity of the hardware modification, it's a pretty impressive feat.

            After a few weeks of controversy over potential overheating in the new iPhone 15 Pro models, Apple this week released a software update to help address the issue, which the company says is not the result of the new titanium casing or other thermal design problems.

Apple is also continuing work on the next round of more significant software updates led by iOS 17.1, and we're keeping tabs on everything that's new. Notably, the latest watchOS 10.1 beta enables the Double Tap feature that was one of the main promotional selling points of the latest Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 models, so read on for all the details on these stories and more!

            With every new operating system release and new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, there are complaints about issues with battery life, and this year is no exception.

            Apple today shared a "Shot on iPhone 15 Pro" ad starring singer Olivia Rodrigo on its YouTube channel in Canada. The video provides a brief behind-the-scenes look at a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/olivia-rodrigo-iphone-15-pro/">music video</a> that Rodrigo and her team shot entirely on the iPhone 15 Pro.
