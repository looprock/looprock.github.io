Design wise, you could potentially mistake Samsung's Galaxy Buds3 Pro for the ‌AirPods Pro‌. The Buds3 Pro have the same general shape and a silicone tip, though it's worth noting that the Buds3 Pro come in both white and gray, so you're not limited to white as you are with the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2. The charging case is similar to the AirPods Charging Case too, but there's a transparent upper portion.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>

Not all of the new features Apple showed off at WWDC last month will be available right away, however, with some rolling out in later iOS 18 updates over the next year. In particular, significant Siri enhancements with Apple Intelligence are reportedly slated for iOS 18.4 in the spring of 2025. Other news this week included hints of a touchscreen-equipped HomePod and rumors about the next-generation Apple Watch SE, so read on below for all the details!

            If you've been following Apple news and rumors for the last decade, you might remember The Unofficial Apple Weblog, or TUAW. TUAW <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/30/aohell/">was shut down</a> and the site was folded into <em>Engadget</em> way back in 2015, but this month, a zombie TUAW website reappeared.

<br/>
As it turns out, the TUAW domain name was purchased by a Hong Kong-based advertising agency, and it now hosts stolen content rewritten using AI. TUAW started posting AI-generated content earlier this week, with all of it stolen from sites like <em>MacRumors</em> and <em>9to5Mac</em>.

The new TUAW website takes articles from Apple news sites and runs them through AI to change the wording. There are multiple stolen images that have been lifted from <em>MacRumors</em> for these articles, with the graphics used [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's Vision Pro spatial computing headset has yet to sell 100,000 units in the quarter since it launched in the U.S. in February, according to market tracker IDC (via <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-11/apple-s-vision-pro-won-t-cross-500-000-sales-this-year-idc-says">Bloomberg</a></em>).

<br/>
The device is projected to see a 75% drop in domestic sales in the current quarter, but the launch of Vision Pro internationally this month is expected to offset that decline. 
<br/>
<br/>
IDC believes that a more affordable version at roughly half the price of the current $3,500 unit should rekindle interest in 2025, but sales are not expected to rise significantly over the coming year. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> is set to launc [...]<br>
