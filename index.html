            <p>Etsy <a href="https://www.etsy.com/news/cant-describe-what-youre-looking-for-search-with-images-instead-dupe">announced</a> the arrival of a powerful new image-based discovery tool on Etsy’s mobile apps. The ability to search by image gives buyers the opportunity to search the Etsy marketplace using their own photos as a reference. Tap the camera icon in the search bar to take a picture, and in a fraction of a second we’ll surface visually similar results from our inventory of nearly 100 million listings. Searching by image is being rapidly adopted throughout the e-commerce industry, and nowhere does it make more sense than on Etsy, where the uniqueness of our sellers’ creations can’t always be expressed easily with words. In this post we’ll give you a look at the machine-learning architecture behind our search by image feature and the work we did to evolve it.</p>
