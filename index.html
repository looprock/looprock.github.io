            <b>Published:</b> 2025-01-18 07:16:58-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 19 is still around six months away from being unveiled, but rumors about the upcoming software update are already starting to stack up.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-978991" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Generic-iOS-19-Feature-Mock-Light.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Below, we recap iOS 19 rumors so far.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Redesigned Camera App</h2>
<br/>
A new leak has allegedly revealed a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/ios-19-redesigned-camera-app-visionos-rumor/">redesigned Camera app coming with iOS 19</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
On his YouTube channel Front Page Tech this week, Jon Prosser <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaP_q9W3AQE">shared a video</a> showing what the new Camera app will apparently look like, with the key change being translucent menus for camera controls. Overall, the design of these menus looks similar to visionOS, the software platform for Apple's Vision Pro headset.

In this new Reels feed filled with friend recommendations, there will be an option to "start a conversation" with someone over a reel that they've liked.
