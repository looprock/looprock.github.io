<h2 id="whatisashader">What is a Shader?</h2>
<p>Based on what has been described in a previous article, a shader is a small program that can be used to create interesting effects in our projects. It contains mathematical calculations and lists of instructions (commands). They allow us to process color for each pixel in the area covering the object on our computer screen or to work with object transformations (for example, to create dynamic grass or water).</p>
