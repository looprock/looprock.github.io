            If you make a call and are placed on hold, a new feature in ‌iOS 26‌ will do the waiting for you so you can do other things. Hold Assist listens for hold music playing, and then alerts you when a person comes on the line so you can pick up the call.

Hold Assist is available on any iPhone that supports iOS 26 (i.e. it's not an Apple Intelligence feature).

When you're placed on hold during a phone call, Hold Assist will launch automatically after 10 to 15 seconds. You'll know about it when a notification appears on your screen asking "Hold this Call?" Tap the <strong>Hold</strong> [...]<br>

            ChatGPT users can now interact with a handful of third-party apps directly within their conversations, OpenAI has <a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1975261605605859369">announced</a>.

<br/>
The new Apps SDK allows developers to build tools that blend naturally into chats, and initial partners include Spotify, Canva, Zillow, Expedia, Booking.com, Coursera, and Figma.
<br/>
<br/>
Users can summon apps by name. For example, you can ask "Spotify, make a playlist for my party this Friday." ChatGPT can also suggest relevant apps automatically. For instance, when discussing home purchases, ChatGPT might surface Zillow to browse listings on an interactive map.

<h2>Alarms and Timers</h2>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the second beta of iOS 26.1, Apple updated the design of alarms set on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, making them harder to dismiss than before.

<br/>
Stopping an alarm in iOS 26.1 beta 2 requires a new Slide to Stop gesture rather than a simple tap. You can continue to tap to snooze an alarm, but if you want to turn it off entirely, you need to use a swipe.
<br/>
<br/>
Transitioning from a tap to a slide gesture to stop an alarm could potentially help people who sleepily dismiss an alarm without meaning to. It's easy to accidentally tap Stop instead of Snooze in the current version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, but now if you blindly tap at your ‌iPhone‌ in the morning, you won't be able to disable your alarm entirely.

Slide Over was removed in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a> because Apple replaced it with a new windowed multitasking system, but some ‌iPad‌ users missed the feature.

The updated version of Slide Over works with all of the new ‌iPadOS 26‌ multitasking features. You can have multiple app windows open, and then use Slide Over to quickly get to an app that overlays your windowed apps.

To use Slide Over in iPadOS 26.1, you'll need to tap on the green icon of an app's window to open up the window sizing controls. From there, you can tap on the "Enter Slide Over" button.
