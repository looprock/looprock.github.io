The leaker and aggregator known as "yeux1122" outlined the latest news on Korean social media site Naver. TSMC has apparently started notifying major clients of impending price increases for advanced fabrication processes below 5-nanometers. This would include Apple's A16, A17, A18, A19, M3, M4, and M5 chips, as well as any future iterations. The price hikes are expected to be in the range of 8–10% and commence next year.

Qualcomm's semiconductor arm, known as Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT), apparently recorded strong year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, led by rising Android device sales and increasing chip content per device. <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></em> cited remarks from President and CEO Cristiano Amon, who said that non-Apple QCT revenue rose by 18% during the quarter.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple in iOS 26.2 will disable automatic Wi-Fi network syncing between iPhone and Apple Watch in the European Union to comply with the bloc's regulations, suggests a new report.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1021796" height="923" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/apple-watch-se-3-always-on.jpg" width="1641"/>
<br/>
Normally, when an iPhone connects to a new Wi-Fi network, it automatically shares the network credentials with the paired Apple Watch. This allows the watch to connect to the same network independently – for example, when the iPhone isn't nearby – without the user needing to enter the password manually.
<br/>
<br/>
The feature's removal appears to be Apple's response to the European Commission's Digital Markets Act (DMA) interoperability requirements, which Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/19/apple-eu-interoperability-bad-for-products-users/">publicly criticized</a> on  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has changed how you dismiss iPhone alarms in iOS 26.1, and your morning muscle memory may have needed tweaking as a result. By default, the Clock app now requires a slide gesture to stop an alarm from the Lock Screen, replacing the previous tap-to-stop button that was redesigned in iOS 26. Snoozing still works with a simple tap, but turning off an alarm entirely demands the extra swipe motion.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1022258" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/ios-26-1-slide-to-stop.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
The change appears designed to prevent accidental dismissals when you're reaching for your phone in the morning. By requiring a more deliberate action, you're less likely to silence your alarm when you meant to hit snooze. If you don't like the change, you can revert the alarm interface back to the previous Stop button by following these steps.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's second iPhone Air model is in development and could feature two rear cameras instead of one, according to a Chinese leaker with sources within Apple's supply chain.

<br/>
The Weibo-based account "<a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/QcA9idfbh">Digital Chat Station</a>" claims that Apple is evaluating a dual-lens setup for the next version of its ultra-thin iPhone, with a 48MP Fusion Ultra Wide camera joining the existing 48MP Fusion Main camera, similar to the base iPhone 17.
<br/>
<br/>
However, the leaker says that the second-generation device will keep the distinctive horizontal camera plateau, suggesting the second lens will sit alongside the existing one, unlike the dual-lens vertical arrangement on the iPhone 17.

 Multiple technologies are housed in the plateau of the iPhone Air to maximize space f [...]<br>

            It's been over a decade since Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> smart home platform launched, and it is overdue for an update. ‌HomeKit‌ and the Home app can no longer keep up with AI-powered solutions from other companies like Google and Amazon, but that's set to change with a smart home revamp that Apple has planned for 2026.

‌iPhone‌ users in Japan can select from Bing, Google, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo Japan, or Ecosia, the same options available globally in the Safari settings. In most other countries, Google is the default search engine and there is no prompt to choose a different option when the ‌iPhone‌ first starts up.
