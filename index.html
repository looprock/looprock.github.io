            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-08 09:03:15-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Earlier this week, a leaker known as Majin Bu revealed that you <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/06/iphone-17-liquid-silicone-cases-rumor/">might be able to attach a lanyard</a> to Apple's official iPhone 17 cases.

<br/>
It turns out that Majin Bu was not the only source to make such a claim this week, as another leaker known as DuanRui also shared a CAD of an alleged iPhone 17 Pro case with two spots to attach a lanyard, in the bottom corners.
<br/>
<br/>
DuanRui's post was spotted <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/08/06/phone-17-case-lineup-could-take-design-cue-from-airpods-pro/">by <em>9to5Mac</em>'s Zac Hall</a>.

The iPhone 17 Pro is expected to introduce a significant redesign. The device will move from a titanium frame <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/07/iphone-17-pro-to-reverse-iphone-x-design-decision/">to an aluminum unibody</a>.

Specifically, the law "forbids designated providers from preventing individual app providers from using alternative browser engines."
<br/>
<br/>
In most countries, Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and other popular web browsers on iOS are all currently forced to use WebKit, which is the web engine that powers Safari. Apple has previously stated that the WebKit requirement is due to security and privacy considerations, but critics have argued that the policy is anticompetitive.
