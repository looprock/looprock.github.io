            <b>Published:</b> 2024-11-23 08:36:57-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            For the first time in nearly a decade, Apple is able to repair individual MacBook Pro speakers without replacing other components too.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979210" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/2024-MacBook-Pro-Space-Black.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
In a memo shared with Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers this week, Apple said it is offering speakers as standalone repair parts for the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with the M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips. This is the first time Apple has made individual MacBook Pro speaker parts available since 2015.
<br/>
<br/>
For all MacBook Pro models released between 2016 and 2023, Apple replaces the entire "top case" with the battery and other components for speaker repairs. This results in out-of-warranty speaker repairs costing hundreds of dollars more than they should, so standalone speaker parts will make these repairs far more affordable.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Repair site iFixit today shared a teardown video of the M4 Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a>, giving us a look inside of the machine. Apple didn't make any external design changes to the ‌MacBook Pro‌ models, but iFixit was hopeful for repairability improvements.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the M4 Pro ‌MacBook Pro‌ that iFixit took apart was almost identical to the M3 ‌MacBook Pro‌, which means Apple kept almost the same internal design as well.
<br/>
<br/>
The M4 Pro ‌MacBook Pro‌ has a larger heatsink than the M3 ‌MacBook Pro‌ for improved heat dissipation, but the battery build and size are the same. Removing the battery still requires removing the trackpad because the battery's adhesive tabs are under the trackpad hardware. Getting to the logic board is "incredibly complex and tedious" due to all the screws and the cables that are in the way.

Apple previously announced that new "Silo" episodes would be released on Fridays, but the third episode of the second season will instead be released on Wednesday, November 27.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The European Commission has ended its antitrust investigation into Apple's App Store rules for ebook and audiobook apps, following the withdrawal of a complaint by an ebook distributor.

<br/>
Originally <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/16/eu-opens-investigations-app-store-apple-pay/">launched in June 2020</a>, the investigation was sparked by a complaint from Rakuten's Kobo subsidiary. Kobo had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/16/apple-new-eu-antitrust-complaint-kobo/">argued</a> that Apple's mandatory 30% commission on App Store purchases made it virtually impossible to operate profitably while competing with Apple Books, which isn't subject to the same fee structure.

The probe examined Apple's requirement that developers use its in-app purchase system, and restrictions preventing develop [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's restrictions on mobile browsers are limiting innovation and holding back new features that could benefit iPhone users, according to provisional findings published today by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).

<br/>
In its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-publishes-provisional-findings-in-mobile-browsers-and-cloud-gaming-market-investigation">report</a>, the CMA's independent inquiry group determined that Apple's Safari browser policies prevent competing browsers from implementing certain features, such as faster webpage loading technologies. The investigation also revealed that many UK app developers would prefer to offer progressive web apps as an alternative to App Store distribution, but Apple's current iOS limitations make this impractical.

            Introduction: Welcome to Episode 6 of the Fearless Concurrency in Rust series! In this episode, we explore the powerful concept of ARC (Atomic Reference Counting) and its critical role in managing shared resources in multithreaded Rust programs. By leveraging ARC, developers can safely share ownership of data across threads without relying on a traditional garbage collector, enabling efficient, flexible, and scalable concurrency.
What is ARC?: Understanding Atomic Reference Counting as a lightweight, manual garbage collection system.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If we plot the metrics associated with large DDoS attacks observed in the last 10 years, does it show a straight, steady increase in an exponential curve that keeps becoming steeper, or is it closer to a linear growth? Our analysis found the growth is not linear but rather is exponential, with the slope varying depending on the metric (rps, pps or bps).<br>
