            <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Personalization is vital to connect our unique marketplace to the right buyer at the right time. Etsy has recently introduced a novel, general approach to personalizing ML models based on encoding and learning from short-term (one-hour) sequences of user actions through a reusable three-component deep learning module, the <em>adSformer Diversifiable Personalization Module (ADPM)</em>. We describe in detail our method in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01255.pdf">recent paper</a>, with an emphasis on personalizing the CTR (clickthrough rate) and PCCVR (post-click conversion rate) ranking models we use in Etsy Ads. Here, we'd like to present a brief overview.</p>
<p>Etsy offers its sellers the opportunity to place sponsored listings as a supplement to the organic results returned by Etsy search. For sellers and buyers alike, it’s important that those sponsored listings be as relevant to the user’s intent as possible. As Figure 1 suggests, when it comes to search, a “jacket” isn'</p> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Ember earlier this year introduced a new version of its electric Travel Mug, adding a key Apple feature - <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> support. You might be wondering, why does a mug need ‌Find My‌? I'm not sure I have a great explanation, but it's a nice-to-have add-on for a product that's positioned as a small luxury.

<br/>
The Ember Travel Mug 2 is $200, and the reason it's so expensive is because it's self-heating. It can keep a beverage at your desired temperature for three hours while on the go, or all day when on the included charging coaster. The temperature can be set from 120°F to 145°F, which is hot, but not likely to cause burns.

The update is set to focus on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/">M3</a> chip, with no other major changes rumored, likely owing to the complete redesign that the current machine received upon its introduction in April 2021.
