Called Phoenix, the app will be developed for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and Mac in tandem with Ivory, the app that Tapbots created for the Mastodon social network.

Tapbots does not plan to stop development on Ivory, and work on the Mastodon app will continue after Phoenix is released. The two apps will share features, but will be separate.

Once the new MacBook Air or Mac Studio are updated to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/04/apple-seeds-ios-18-4-public-beta-2/">macOS Sequoia 15.4</a>, which is set to be released in April, users will be able to simply bring their iPhone or iPad close to the Mac to quickly sign in to their Apple Account. This will simplify the process of getting the user's files, photos, messages, passwords, and more on to the new Mac.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today announced the next of its M4 Mac models, but how much better really is the M4 chip over its predecessor?

<br/>
The M4 chip debuted in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> last year, promising around 20% faster performance than the M3 chip in both single and multi-core tasks. All of the key differences between the two chip generations are listed below:

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-05 09:04:26+01:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p><em>One bad apple ruins the bunch.</em></p>
<p>The O-Ring Theory, proposed by economist Michael Kremer in 1993, describes how small failures in complex, interdependent tasks can lead to major breakdowns. Named after the Challenger disaster, where a faulty O-ring caused the shuttleâs destruction, this model applies to production, labor markets, and economic development.</p>
<p>In an O-ring system, tasks must be performed at a consistently high level because a single weak link can compromise the entire process. This leads to high-skill clustering, where talented workers seek equally skilled colleagues, reinforcing economic inequality between firms, industries, and countries.</p>
<p>For example, in tech, a bad developer in a high-stakes project can introduce critical bugs, limiting the success of even the best engineers. This explains why top companies attract and retain top talentâbecause output depends on every link in the chain functioning well.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Median Voter Theory (MVT) suggests that in a majority-rule election, the candidate closest to the median voterâs views will win. Since most voters are partisan and vote predictably, elections are decided by swing voters in the middle. To win, candidates adjust their positions to attract this decisive group, often moving toward the political center.</p>
<p>Developed by Anthony Downs in 1957, MVT explains why general election candidates tend to sound more moderate than during primaries, where they appeal to their base. Over time, this leads to policy convergence, with major parties offering similar centrist policies.</p>
<p>However, MVT assumes politics follows a single left-right spectrum, ignores low voter turnout, and struggles in polarized environments, where candidates may focus more on energizing their base than winning the middle. Despite these flaws, MVT remains a key theory in understanding why democratic elections often favor centrist policies over extreme positions.</p>
