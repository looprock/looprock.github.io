<br/>
Apple said the 3D-printed titanium USB-C port offers three benefits compared to one manufactured with a conventional forging process: it is thinner, stronger, and uses 33% less material to be more environmentally friendly.
<br/>
<br/>
3D printing for metal is also known as metal additive manufacturing, a process that involves creating objects layer by layer with powdered metal, based on a CAD model.

Despite this manufacturing innovation, the iPhone Air's USB-C port is limited to outdated USB 2 speeds of up to 480 Mb/ [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>

Apple says on its <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#apple-intelligence-live-translation-with-airpods">feature availability webpage</a> that "Apple Intelligence: Live Translation with AirPods" won't be available if both the user is physically in the EU and their Apple Account region is in the EU. Apple doesn't give a reason for the restriction, but legal and regulatory pressures seem the most plausible culprits.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Following the debut of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> lineup on Tuesday, Apple quietly updated its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup so that the standard ‌iPhone 16‌ is now sold only in a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-16">128GB configuration</a> for $699. The previous storage tiers of 256GB and 512GB for the base ‌iPhone 16‌ have been discontinued.

The ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus retains slightly more flexibility by remaining available in both 128GB and 256GB versions, although its 512GB tier has also been removed.

The change makes sense for Apple's marketing strategy. Given that all ‌iPhone 17‌ models now start at 256GB, maintaining a 256GB ‌iPhone 16‌  [...]<br>

            With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> and 17 Pro Max, Apple introduced a new design for the rear of the device.
