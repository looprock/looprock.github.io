<p id="3CCKXp">Chatbots occupy a tricky space for users — they have to be a search engine, a creation tool, and an assistant all at once. That’s especially true for a chatbot coming from Google, which is increasingly counting on AI to supplement its search engine, its voice assistant, and just about every productivity tool in its arsenal. </p>

So I plunked down $20 and decided to see how Gemini Advanced stood up to the rival service.</p>
