A provision in the bill allows regulator Ofcom to order messaging services to use "accredited technology" to look for and take down child sexual abuse material.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 17, expected to be released in September, if you change your iPhone's passcode and forget it soon after, Apple now offers you a 72-hour grace period to fix it without getting locked out of your device. Here's how it works.

<br/>
In iOS 17 and iPadOS 17, it is now possible to reset an iPhone or iPad's new passcode with the previous passcode you used for up to three days after the change is made. In other words, Apple lets you use your old passcode within 72 hours of setting a new one, which is handy if you're someone who is likely to forget a newly created passcode.

When you enter an incorrect passcode on a device running iOS 17 after making a change, simply tap on the <strong>Forgot Passcode?</strong> option at the bottom of the display to use the <strong>Try Passcode Reset</strong> option. Tapping it allow [...]<br>
