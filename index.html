            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today introduced a new firmware update for the third-generation AirPods. The new firmware is version 6A321, up from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/19/apple-airpods-3-firmware-update-december/">6A317 firmware</a> introduced in December.

Apple's AirPods firmware updates often do not come with details on new features, so it is unclear what might be included in the software.

Apple also does not offer instructions on how to upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ are connected to an iOS device. Putting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ in the case, connecting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to a power source, and then pairing the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to an iOS device or Mac should force the update.

<br/>
The change is part of Apple's potential switch to higher-density Quad-Level Cell (QLC) NAND flash memory for its 1TB <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models, which the company is said to currently be "actively evaluating." Apple currently uses costlier Triple-Level Cell (TLC) NAND.

Using QLC NAND would allow Apple to cram more storage into a smaller space and comes at a lower price, but with the disadvantage of slower read and write speeds. QLC NAND can also be less durable and reliable than TLC NAND, handlin [...]<br>

            LinkedIn is always working hard to make sure that its platform is a safe and trusted place for its members. We've been on a journey to strengthen our platform against abuse by continuously improving our account restriction systems. This helps us ensure that our policies are followed and that our community can keep growing. In a previous blog post, we talked about how we built our anti-abuse platform using CASAL. This powerful system is our first line of defense against bad actors and adversarial attacks. In this blog post, we'll go deeper into how we manage account restrictions. [&#8230;]<br>
