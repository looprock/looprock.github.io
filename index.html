            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's stock Notes app got hardly any screen time during yesterday's WWDC keynote, but one powerful addition to the app in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> is a new ability to link notes and connect related notes together.
<br/>

<br/>
With just a few taps, you can create links between notes, making it easy to jump from one idea to another. Long press on a space in any note, and a new "Add Link" option can be found in the pop-up menu. Tapping it lets you link to another note by searching its title or entering a URL. 
<br/>
<br/>
You can create an optional alternative title for the link, or just stick with the original title for clarity. Once you're done, the link appears as hyperlink-style underlined text in your note, and tapping it snaps you straight into the note you linked to.

            Apple is making contact and password sharing a lot easier in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> by letting users insert them into any text field they encounter in the system.

<br/>
When long pressing in a text box, a new "Insert" option appears in the pop-up menu. Tapping it brings up another menu with two additional new options: "Contacts" and "Passwords."

<br/>
Choosing Contacts takes you straight to your contacts list for you to make your selection, while tapping Password takes you to your passwords keychain after authentication.
