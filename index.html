            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The developers behind popular photography app Halide <a href="https://www.shotwithkino.com/">today announced the launch of Kino</a>, an app designed for capturing cinematic video. Kino has the tools that professionals need while also providing guidance to amateur videographers.

<br/>
Kino offers a one-tap video recording feature with support for a range of color presets. The Instant Grade feature allows users to choose presets created by experts or import their own LUTs. By applying color grading while recording, Kino saves time by removing the need for editing.
<br/>
<br/>
An AutoMotion feature helps users capture cinematic movement in a shot by using a 180-degree shutter angle by default. When enough ambient light is available, the Auto label will turn green to indicate that it is an ideal time to capture motion.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 18 will be unveiled at Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in less than two weeks, and the update will include some new features for CarPlay.

<br/>
Below, we recap new accessibility features that Apple recently previewed for CarPlay, and discuss the current status of the promised next-generation CarPlay.
<br/>
<br/>
The first beta of iOS 18 will likely be made available to members of the Apple Developer Program immediately following the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/wwdc-2024-full-schedule/">WWDC keynote on June 10</a>, and a public beta is usually released in July, which will allow iPhone users to test out the new CarPlay features. As usual, the update should be widely released in September.

<p id="NQPWLg">Browser bloat has long been a problem, but now Microsoft is doing something about it, and not by reducing features but by speeding the browser up. The company is working to make Edge’s user interface more responsive, starting with its Browser Essentials menu.</p>
<p id="Z0z1mk">This menu — which displays information about Edge’s performance — is now 42 percent faster, thanks to a WebUI 2.0 architecture migration. You can see how much faster the Browser Essentials menu loads on WebUI 2.0 compared to React and WebUI with Javascript in the video below. Microsoft says the menu is 76 percent faster on devices without an SSD or with less than 8GB of RAM.</p>
