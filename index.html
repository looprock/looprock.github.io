            <b>Published:</b> 2023-10-24 10:43:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's upcoming "Scary Fast" event will focus on the M3 series MacBook Pro models, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1716871328794620072">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. Kuo's wording suggests that he is expecting multiple M3 chips rather than just a single M3 chip, hinting at the possibility of M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-904044" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/macbook-pro-pink.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
If Apple does release M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips at once, we can expect to see the new chips introduced in 13-inch, 14-inch, and 16-inch MacBook Pro models. 
<br/>
<br/>
Kuo says that he previously predicted that Apple would not likely introduce new MacBook Pro models in 2023 because of "limited 4Q 23 shipments," and if new MacBook Pros do come out in November or December, the tight supply will last until the first quarter of 2024.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is preparing for the upcoming Mac-focused "Scary Fast" event that is set to take place on Monday, October 30 at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time, and the company has added livestream placeholders both to the Events website and to YouTube.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
On <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/?useASL=true">the Events website</a>, Apple has added an option to add the event to your calendar, and on YouTube, there is an option to get a reminder when the event begins. While the YouTube placeholder features a static Apple logo, Apple's Events website includes an animated logo that morphs into a Finder icon, hinting at the subject of the event.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple has never held a worldwide event at night before, so this is a first for the company. The livestream will begin at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the night before Halloween, which equates to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, 12:00 a.m. in the UK, 1:00 to 2:00 a.m. in Europe, and 9:00 a.m. in many countries in Asia.

            Amazon <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-passwordless-sign-in-passkey">today announced</a> that it has added passkey support to its desktop sites and mobile apps, allowing customers to sign in to their accounts without the need for a password.

<br/>
Passkeys are a more secure alternative to passwords because a passkey cannot be shared with another person through a phishing attempt or leaked online through a database hack. Passkeys do not require customers to remember a password or add a two-factor authentication code, but they do require a verified device.
<br/>
<br/>
Passkeys can be set up in the Amazon settings, and on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac, logging in to an Amazon account can be done with a &lt;a h [...]<br>

            <p>Meta has a very large monorepo, with many  different programming languages. To optimize build and performance, we developed our own build system called Buck, which was first open-sourced in 2013.  Buck2 is the recently open-sourced successor. In our internal tests at Meta, we observed that Buck2 completed builds approximately 2x as fast as Buck1. Below [...]</p>
