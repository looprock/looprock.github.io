            <b>Published:</b> 2023-07-10 01:54:59-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has shared two new ads on its YouTube channel, one promoting the long battery life of the iPhone 14 Plus and the other using the iPhone 14 Pro to highlight Apple's Crash Detection feature.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The first one-minute ad, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuOQdo7t3Xk">Battery for Miles,</a>" depicts a man slowly driving a tractor as he tows a gigantic pumpkin along a long, straight road seemingly in the middle of nowhere. "Two Miles An Hour" by Ludacris plays in the background.
<br/>
<br/>
Mounted in front of his steering wheel is an iPhone 14 Plus running Apple Maps, which tells him "In 102 miles, continue straight." After the man briefly raises an eyebrow, the tagline appears: "Our longest lasting battery life ever. Relax, it's iPhone 14 Plus."
<br/>
<br/>
