            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-21 08:22:35-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            A few years ago, the American automaker General Motors (GM) announced that it would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/31/general-motors-to-phase-out-apple-carplay/">phasing out support for CarPlay</a> and Android Auto in its new electric vehicles, in favor of its own software platform. It was a controversial decision, as many drivers who are in the market for a new vehicle consider CarPlay to be a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/31/apple-carplay-jd-power-study/">must-have feature</a>.

<br/>
The update includes the ability to add up to ten "Topics" to your bio, which can be used to showcase your interests and connect with like-minded users. When someone visits your profile, the topics will be prominently displayed and can be tapped to view related conversations. Meta says this feature is a test, so it might not be around for ever.

<br/>
Meanwhile, for content creators, Threads is now suggesting trending topics when drafting posts. According to Meta's internal data, posts with tagged topics generally receive more views than those without, so this could potentially offer a boost to creator reach and engagement.

            Google is rolling out an improved Gmail search function powered by AI that the company <a href="https://blog.google/products/gmail/gmail-search-update-relevant-emails/">reckons</a> will "show you the most relevant results, faster."

<br/>
Search in Gmail has traditionally returned results from your inbox in chronological order based on keywords. That's not great if the email you need was sent months or years ago. 
<br/>
<br/>
What the new method does to improve things is factor in elements like how often you contact someone, which emails you've clicked the most, and how recently the emails arrived in your inbox.

<br/>
"With this update, the emails you're looking for are far more likely to be at the top of your search results — saving you valuable time and helping you find important information more easily," claims Google.

            Apple plans to use liquid metal in the hinges of its upcoming foldable iPhone to improve durability and reduce screen creasing, <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1902942517861159377">according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.

<br/>
Apple has reportedly chosen liquid metal, which is manufactured using a die-casting process, as a key component in addressing common issues with foldable devices. The design choice aims to enhance screen flatness and minimize the crease marks that typically plague folding displays.
<br/>
<br/>
Kuo notes that Apple has previously used liquid metal in smaller components like SIM ejector pins, but the foldable iPhone will mark the company's first major use of the material in a critical mechanical part. Dongguan EonTec will reportedly be the exclusive supplier of liquid metal.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Earlier this week, the investment firm GF Securities shared multiple research notes regarding Apple's future chips. In one of these notes, it said the A20 chip for the iPhone 18 series would be manufactured <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/a20-chip-still-3nm-rumor/">with TSMC's third-generation 3nm process</a>, N3P, and in another it said that the chip would use TSMC's newer 2nm process N2.

<br/>
GF Securities is a large organization with many analysts, and it seems like some wires got crossed. In an email to <em>MacRumors</em>, the firm's lead Apple analyst Jeff Pu has since clarified that he believes the A20 chip will be manufactured with the N2 process, so the information about the chip using the N3P process should be disregarded.

The attackers had previously targeted Windows users with fake Microsoft security alerts, but then adapted their tactics in response to new anti-scareware features deployed in Chrome, Edge, and Firefox browsers earlier this year.
