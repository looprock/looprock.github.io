The update offers real-time collaboration with third-party apps like Asana, Slack, Figma, Canva, and more without requiring users to switch between tabs or apps.

The feature is powered by MCP Apps, a new extension to the Model Context Protocol that lets any MCP server deliver an interactive interface within supporting AI products. Anthropic open-sourced MCP last year as a universal standard for connecting tools to AI applications.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Kubernetes memory limits introduce a subtle but critical interaction with the Go runtime that can determine whether a service runs efficiently or fails under load. This article explores how Go manages memory under normal conditions and what changes when Kubernetes enforces hard memory constraints. Using controlled load testing, it shows why Go is generally excellent at self regulating memory, how OOM events emerge once limits are imposed, and how tools like GOMEMLIMIT can be used to align the runtime with container boundaries. Originally published in July 2024, the guidance remains highly relevant for teams running Go services in containerized environments where stability and throughput are tightly coupled to memory configuration.</p><br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iOS 26.3, Apple is adding a new "limit precise location" setting that reduces the location data available to mobile networks to increase user privacy.

<br/>
Mobile networks determine location based on the cellular towers that a device connects to, but with the setting enabled, some of the data typically made available to mobile networks is being restricted. Rather than being able to see location down to a street address, carriers will instead be limited to the neighborhood where a device is located, for example.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>People often ask me where to stay in Amsterdam that’s fun, but not full of tourists and drunk people. Here’s what I tell them.</p>
<p>You should stay in De Pijp or the Jordaan. These are the neighborhoods just outside of the touristy part of city center that still have all the things you’re thinking of when you think Amsterdam, plenty of nice bars and cafes, hipstery and traditional eateries, excellent architecture and narrow streets, canals, bikes, etc. And yes, plenty of coffee shops (places to buy weed).</p>
<p>If you want more sleepy, but sill urban with stores and coffee ships and stuff, there’s Watergraafsmeer or the even calmer Eastern Docklands.</p>
<p>But I’d stay in De Pijp.</p>
<p>Here’s is an imprecise map:</p>

            Techno Tim joins Adam to dive deep into the state of homelab'ing in 2026. Hardware is scarce and expensive due to the AI gold rush, but software has never been better. From unleashing Claude on your UDM Pro to building custom Proxmox CLIs, they explores how AI is transforming what's possible in the homelab. Tim declares 2026 the "Year of Self-Hosted Software" while Adam reveals his homelab's secret weapons: DNSHole (a Pi-hole replacement written in Rust) and PXM (a Proxmox automation CLI).<br>
