Xthings says the dual biometric approach is meant to be more secure than traditional biometric unlocking methods, but it may also exist because few companies have managed to master facial recognition as accurate as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>.

The Meta-owned messaging app is rolling out Member Tags, Text Stickers, and Event Reminders, all of which are designed to give group chats more flexibility and organization.
<br/>
<br/>
Member Tags let you assign yourself different roles in different group chats for more context – so you can be "Coach" in one thread and "Dad" in another, for example. Meanwhile, Text Stickers instantly turn typed words into sticker graphics that users can then save to custom packs.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Spotify is bringing its long-running Listening Activity feature to its mobile apps, so now you can see what your friends are listening to on the streaming service when you're away from your desk.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031588" height="2160" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/spotify-messages-profile@2x.jpg" width="3840"/>

For years, Spotify's desktop app has allowed users to check on their friends' listening habits via a Friend Activity sidebar, but the ability has not been available on iOS and Android apps until now. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you're familiar with Listening Activity, its appearance on mobile shouldn't throw up any real surprises. You can view what people are listening to in the app's sidebar, next to any messages, and you can tap the track to listen to it yourself, add it to your library, or react to it with emoji.

At 52 inches, the ultra-wide curved monitor features a 21:9 aspect ratio with 6,144 x 2,560 resolution at 129 pixels per inch and supports refresh rates up to 120Hz.
<br/>
<br/>
The display uses IPS Black panel technology for deeper blacks and improved contrast compared to standard IPS panels, with brightness listed as 400 cd/m. Dell says it emits up to 60% less blue light than competing monitors while maintaining professional-grade color accuracy, and it includes an ambient light sensor for eye comfort during extended use.
