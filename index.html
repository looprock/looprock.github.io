            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Though pre-launch Apple Watch rumors suggested that Apple would update its entire Apple Watch lineup this year, Apple ended up focusing primarily on the Apple Watch Series 10. We didn't get a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> or a new Apple Watch Ultra 3, with Apple only adding a new color option for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>.

            With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple is adding a new option that will let you pause a video in the middle of a recording, providing an option for capturing multiple shots in a single video rather than having to start and stop new videos each time.

When you start a video in ‌iOS 18‌, you'll see a new pause button on the left side. Pressing it pauses the video, and pressing the button again unpauses. You can still stop a video at any time using the middle stop button.

Apple added the new video pausing feature in the ‌iOS 18‌ release candidate that was provided to developers and public beta testers today.

            There are no major differentiating features between the two Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models this year, with Apple aiming for feature parity between the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max.

<br/>
Last year, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max was updated with a 5x Telephoto lens that used Tetraprism technology, but the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ was limited to 3x zoom. This year, Apple has made improvements that allow both models to offer the 5x Telephoto lens.
