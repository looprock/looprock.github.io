            <b>Published:</b> 2025-05-30 11:51:24-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            All four iPhone 17 models will adopt metalens technology for Face ID, according to Jeff Pu, an Apple analyst at equity research firm GF Securities. He revealed this information in an investor research note earlier this month.

<br/>
Earlier this year, a leaker known as Digital Chat Station also claimed that the iPhone 17 Pro Max would adopt a metalens for Face ID that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/iphone-17-pro-max-smaller-dynamic-island/">integrates the transmitter and receiver components</a>. They said that this change would reduce the size of some of the Face ID components, resulting in a smaller Dynamic Island on the device.
<br/>
<br/>
Last year, Pu also said that the iPhone 17 Pro Max would have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-pro-12gb-ram-rumor/">much narrower Dynamic I</a> [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-05-30 11:07:54-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The latest rumored specs for the iPhone 17 base model are underwhelming.

<br/>
In a research note with equity research firm GF Securities this month, Apple analyst Jeff Pu said that the lowest-end iPhone 17 model will be equipped with the same A18 chip that is used in the iPhone 16 base model. The chip will continue to be manufactured with TSMC's second-generation 3nm process, known as N3E, he said.
<br/>
<br/>
The ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air is expected to have an A19 chip, while the iPhone 17 Pro models are expected to have an A19 Pro chip. Both of those chips are expected to be manufactured with TSMC's third-generation 3nm process, known as N3P.
<br/>
<br/>
Pu also expects the iPhone 17 to be equipped with 8GB of RAM, matching the iPhone 16.

Last month, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the iPhone 17 Air and both iP [...]<br>

Despite the ongoing focus in the industry on generative artificial intelligence, Apple is reportedly planning to debut a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ios-19-macos-16-major-design-update/">complete visual redesign</a> of its platforms as "the highlight of the show" at WWDC.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-05-30 08:42:22-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In macOS, a handy option called "Show suggested and recent applications in Dock" (found in <strong>System Settings ➝ Desktop &amp; Dock</strong>) adds a divider to the right-hand side of your Mac's Dock, and after it displays any apps you recently used – or any that macOS thinks may be useful to your workflow – that aren't permanently docked. 
<br/>

<br/>
Assuming that you have no undocked apps that are currently open, the right side of the divider shows three of the most recently used apps that have since been closed. However, there is a way to make it show more, which can be useful if your workflow involves using a lot of undocked apps consecutively.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're comfortable pasting commands into Terminal, it's perfectly possible to increase or decrease the number of recently opened apps that show in your Dock.

            <p>I’m thinking through the topic of ROI for infrastructure software again (obviously for our PaaS stuff). I get asked about this every year or two.

<p>First, that is a very difficult thing to figure out with infrastructure software. What is the ROI of Linux (I guess I mean RHEL), Java, or a laptop?</p>
<p>In each of those cases, the ROI could be infinite: if you didn’t have them, your business would not function.</p>
<p>In other cases true ROI is zero: there is no direct cause between having a laptop and increasing margins on USB cables by 0.5% because your supply chain negotiator could type on a laptop, maybe even accessing the intranet for contract templates with a VPN while they were waiting for their flight to board.

            Apple has announced that its <a href="https://www.apple.com/nl/retail/denhaag">Den Haag store</a> in the Netherlands will be temporarily closed for renovations starting this Sunday, June 1.

<br/>
The store is located in The Hague, the capital city of South Holland.
<br/>
<br/>
First opened in 2014, Apple Den Haag is one of the company's flagship stores, located in a covered walkway with historical architecture. The remodeled store will likely feature an Apple Pickup station for online orders, improved accessibility, and more.

<br/>
Apple has not indicated when the store will reopen, but remodeling often takes months.

Apple has two other stores in the Netherlands, in Amsterdam and Haarlem.

            <hr><p><h3><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/29/iphone-17-display-sizes/" target="_blank">iPhone 17 Display Sizes: What to Expect</a></h3>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-05-29 11:38:24-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> lineup will include four iPhones, and two of those are going to get all-new display sizes. There's the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>, which we've heard about several times, but the standard ‌iPhone 17‌ is also going to have a different display size.
<br/>

<br/>
We've heard a bit about the updated size before, but with most rumors focusing on the ‌iPhone 17 Air‌, it's easy to forget. Display analyst Ross Young today <a href="https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1928146088097349832">reiterated the screen sizes</a> expected for the entire ‌iPhone 17‌ lineup, and it serves as a good reminder about what to expect from Apple's lowest-priced flagship.
