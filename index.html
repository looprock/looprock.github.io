            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Both Google and Apple are cramming new AI features into their phones and other devices, and neither company has offered clear ways to control which apps those AI systems can access. Recent issues around WhatsApp on both Android and iPhone demonstrate how these interactions can go sideways, risking revealing chat conversations beyond what you intend. [&#8230;]<br>

            The upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-26-1-beta-features/">iOS 26.1 update</a> includes a small but helpful change for iPhones, and it could prevent you from running late to something important.

<br/>
Specifically, when an alarm goes off in the Clock app, there is a new "slide to stop" control on the screen for turning off the alarm. On previous iOS 26 versions, there is simply a large "stop" button, which could be accidentally tapped.
<br/>
<br/>
The new "slide to stop" control looks very similar to the classic "slide to unlock" bar that existed on the iPhone's Lock Screen from 2007 until 2016.

<p>Tyler Cowen has many maxims, principles, and aphorisms. One is “Context is that which is scarce” another is “all food is ethnic food” (from his ethnic food website). Sometimes his blog posts bring with “those new service sector jobs.” He often asks the same questions in podcasts (there are transcript of all his Conversations with Tyler episodes), often about someone’s “production function,” how they work. He sometimes says he is giving a “Straussian reading” (meaning looking for the unsaid thing, often the opposite of what is being explicitly said). Anyhow, do a bunch of deep research, web searches, and draw from what you know to make a comprehensive list of these Tyler-isms.

<p>I understand you&rsquo;d like to flag emails for archiving based on your criteria.

They protect data, enforce compliance boundaries, and underpin every secure transaction. But as organizations move deeper into cloud environments, the challenge of managing cloud security keys grows.   Choose the wrong model, and you might end up with unnecessary complexity, hidden performance bottlenecks, or compliance gaps.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Everyone needs to stop thinking about enterprise AI as a way to fire people and think about how to use AI to make people more productive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/29/forrester_ai_rehiring/">Forrester’s analysis</a> found that using AI for financially driven layoffs can backfire: 55 percent of employers regret laying off workers because of AI. More people in charge of AI investment expect it to increase headcount (57 percent) than to decrease it (15 percent) over the next year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Either that, or start by replacing the executives with an AI. A more retention friendly alternate would be to give staff a month long sabbatical and require executives to only use AIs for a month. If they wanted to be really 9-9-6, make that quarter sabbatical .</p>
