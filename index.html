            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Spotify's elusive lossless music experience is being teased again, this time based on code uncovered by <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/12/24128584/spotify-music-pro-lossless-audio">The Verge</a></em> in recent builds of the Spotify app for Android.

<br/>
More than three years have elapsed since Spotify announced its intention to offer a "HiFi" premium option that would give users access to a catalog of CD-quality music tracks. Originally the company said the tier would go live by the end of 2021, but a shift in the wider streaming market upended that idea.
<br/>

<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> has since rolled lossless listening into its standard subscription price, while Amazon stopped charging extra for its lossless music library. The moves effectively kiboshed S [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple will allegedly offer both the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max with a minimum 256GB of storage, doing away with the 128GB starting option on its smaller Pro model for the first time.

<br/>
Currently, Apple's 6.1-inch iPhone 15 Pro starts at $999 and comes with the minimum 128GB of storage, while the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Pro Max starts at $1,199 with a minimum 256GB of storage.  
<br/>
<br/>
However, according to <a href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/apple-could-launch-iphone-16-pro-with-256gb-base-storage/"><em>The Mac Observer</em></a>, Apple will bump up the base storage of the upcoming iPhone 16 Pro to 256GB to match the minimum capacity of the larger iPhone 16 Pro Max, while the starting price of Apple's smaller Pro model will remain at $999.

With a Generative Extend feature, Premiere Pro will be able to add frames to make video clips longer, allowing for properly timed edits and smooth transitions by extending a scene.

Objects in videos will also be able to be added or removed through smart selection and tracking tools. Adobe says that video editors can do things like remove an unwanted item, change an actor's wardrobe, or add set dressings like paintings on the wall or plants on a desk.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>When playing solo D&amp;D, try making full on characters for the major NPCs. This can be more fun because (a) making characters is fun, especially higher level ones, and, (b) you get more faceted NPCs instead of just stock, one-dimensional characters.</p>
<p>I’ve been playing through <em>Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden</em>  and I applied this one of the  duergar dwarves, Durth. In the published adventure, he’s a Duergar Mind Master. Instead of sticking wiht that, I decided to flesh him out a bit, making him a 5th level Artificer. This gave him a steel defender companion and access to interesting spells. I’ve never really played an artificer or looked at that class next, so it was fun to imagine that out. And, then, when it came to the encounter on the ferry in Easthaven, I had a lot more options than what a Mind Master would give.</p>
<p>This investment in time and imagining also creates a closer bond your NPCs. My theory here is that this will make their role in your adventure mor</p> [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-04-15 00:00:00+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Introduction Rust&rsquo;s memory safety features are advantageous to Rust developers because they:
Ensure robust protection against buffer overflows and underflows, enhancing the reliability and security of software.
Empower developers to manage type coercion effectively, promoting code reliability and safety while facilitating safe type conversions.
Provide confidence in writing concurrent code by enforcing strict mutability rules and synchronization, thereby preventing data race issues and ensuring code correctness and efficiency.
With these memory safety features deeply integrated into Rust&rsquo;s design, developers can build more reliable, secure, and efficient software, spanning various aspects of memory management, type handling, and concurrent programming paradigms.<br>
