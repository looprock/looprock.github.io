The combined Netflix and Max plan will be available for $10, but there is a minor catch because the subscriptions are ad-supported. Standalone versions of the ad-supported Netflix and Max plans are priced at $6.99 and $9.99 per month respectively in the United States, so the bundle provides a savings of $7 per month.
<br/>
<br/>
For those potentially interested in the plan, it is worth noting that Netflix's ad-supported tier does restrict some content due to licensing restrictions. This mostly applies to TV shows and movies  [...]<br>

DoorDash began <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/05/doordash-working-on-live-activities/">working on Live Activities support</a> a few months ago, and the feature started rolling out over the past few weeks, but it does not yet appear to be available for all users.

In the ad spot, a band is working on their album cover.

After the change comes into effect on February 15, 2024, Valve said existing Steam Client installations on these operating systems will no longer receive updates of any kind from Steam, including security updates, and technical support for issues related to macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) and 10.14 (Mojave) will not be offered.
