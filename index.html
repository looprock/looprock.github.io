            <p>\</p>
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Design patterns in software are helpful for many reasons, but two of the most important are that they give developers a shared vocabulary and offer solutions to commonly encountered problems. They are popularly used in OO languages but not so often thought of in React projects.</p>
<p>\
In this article, I want to explore the Adapter pattern in React. In case you're not familiar with this pattern, I'll start with the classic object-oriented use case as an introduction. Then, I'll introduce an example of the Adapter pattern in action in a popular <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/react">React</a> library.</p>
<p>\
By the end of the article, I want to be able to answer these two questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What are some signals you should pay attention to when writing React components that point towards using the Adapter pattern?</li>
<li>What are some characteristics of components that use the Adapter pattern?</li>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>The React way of dynamically updating a website’s content is different from Vanilla JavaScript. In JavaScript, we do it by directly manipulating DOM, whereas in React, we have a feature called <code>useState</code>.</p>
<p>\
It is one of the built-in hooks in React. It helps us to declare state variables in Functional Components.</p>
<p>\
We pass the initial state to the useState hook, and in return, it gives us a variable with our state value and a function to update the value.</p>
<p>\
Now let’s compare both ways (JavaScript and React) with an example.</p>
<p>\
Suppose you’ve been given a bag filled with five apples and after some time, you are given seven more apples to put into your bag. Now how many apples will you have in your bag?</p>
<p>\
It's 5+7=12, right?</p>
<p>\
Let’s see how we can show this example in both JavaScript and React:</p>
