            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple researchers have released <a href="https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19808">Pico-Banana-400K</a>, a comprehensive dataset of 400,000 curated images that's been specifically designed to improve how AI systems edit photos based on text prompts.

<br/>
The massive dataset aims to address what Apple describes as a gap in current AI image editing training. While systems like GPT-4o can make impressive edits, the researchers say progress has been limited by inadequate training data built from real photographs. Apple's new dataset aims to improve the situation.

Pico-Banana-400K features images organized into 35 different edit types across eight categories, from basic adjustments like color changes to complex transformations such as converting people into Pixar-style characters or LEGO figures. Each image went throu [...]<br>

            Apple's new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> comes almost 18 months after the previous version with the M4 chip, so how different is the new model and should you consider upgrading?

<br/>
The ‌iPad Pro‌ introduced last year was a major update, debuting the M4 chip, a significantly thinner design, a nano-texture option, OLED displays, a landscape front-facing camera, and more, as well as a new Magic Keyboard with an aluminum top case, function keys, and a trackpad with haptic feedback. With such a big update last year, the new ‌iPad Pro‌ Apple just launched with the M5 chip is much more iterative, focusing largely on chips and connectivity. Beyond their chips, the key differences are as follows:

Market capitalization is based on the total value of all outstanding Apple shares. We won't have an updated share count until Apple provides its earnings for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2025, so it is worth noting that the current market cap is not quite accurate.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-28 12:00:51+01:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <blockquote>
<p>”Tech is a pop culture. Very few of the decisions made in the industry are made rationally or empirically. Studies and tests are used to justify the emotional decisions of the executive or management class. Infrastructure and stack decisions are made hedonistically – “cool” tech that makes the engineers and devs feel good about themselves almost always gets a priority over “boring” tech that has no risks.</p>
<p>The industry, especially the software side of tech, is driven by emotion and a sense of what is fashionable. There is genuinely more grounded engineering – materials, machinery, process, supply chains, etc. – taking place in the fashion industry than there ever has been in the software industry.”</p>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-28 08:58:11+01:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>I solo played “Touch of Water” last night. It’s a good representation of the adventures in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncaged_(anthology)">the <em>Uncaged</em> series</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Claude did a good job adapting it my campaign setting and evolving the story. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusalka">rusalka</a> is a good monster - it’d make a good Eryines-like creature for Auril the Frostmaiden. You can recast Auril regionally, call her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morana_(goddess)">Marzanna or the like</a>, and then have a little frosty pantheon.</p>
<p>The story never resolves what happened to the drowned four year old boy that starts the adventure. An odd omission for a collection of adventures that are usually tightly sewed up by the end.</p>
<p>Here is one of ChatGTP’s interpretations the rusalka.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <blockquote>
<p>Comparing China now to the US in the past isn&rsquo;t just a convenient rhetorical trick, it&rsquo;s arguably causal. While the full, more nuanced story deserves its own piece, the decline of the US&rsquo;s Rust Belt is definitely directly linked to the rise of China. A fate sealed by political decisions, primarily in the US, to go full &lsquo;free trade,&rsquo; which has meant factories leaving Ohio for Henan Province, where people work for less and companies can pollute more. Or as Wall Street called it, &ldquo;changes in policy, starting in the early 80s, but blossoming in the 90s, have allowed US companies to benefit from global labor and regulatory arbitrage, which has increased both their profits, size, and subsequent influence on labor, industrial, and regulatory policy.&rdquo;</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>I grew up as a programmer in the 2000s, in Java culture. The aesthetics were about elegance, understandable simplicity (the opposite of the Perl obfuscation awards), and lots of DRY.</p>
<p>In contrast, you have command line culture, which I suspect is a more dominate programming aesthetic nowadays.</p>
<p>It will become even more so as one off vibe scripts and apps spread. If it&rsquo;s faster or just complete rewrite your code with AI, why bother to fix it?</p>
<p>Anyhow, this <a href="https://codeberg.org/EvanHahn/dotfiles/src/commit/843b9ee13d949d346a4a73ccee2a99351aed285b/home/bin/bin/emoji">a great example of the aesthetic I&rsquo;m talking about</a>. What a great idea, I like it.</p>
