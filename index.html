Under Sounds &amp; Haptics, there's a new "Default Alerts" section that allows you to choose the sound used for all incoming notifications aside from texts, mail alerts, and calendar alerts, which already had customization options.

Apple has not previously offered an interface for tweaking the default notification sound, so this is a notable update for those who have always wanted to select a sound. All of the text tones can be used for the default notification sound.

            At WWDC in June 2022, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/06/apple-announces-multi-display-carplay/">previewed the next generation of CarPlay</a>, promising deeper integration with vehicle functions like A/C and FM radio, support for multiple displays across the dashboard, increased personalization, and more.

Apple's website <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">still says</a> the first vehicles with support for the next-generation CarPlay experience will be announced in "late 2023," but it has not shared any additional details heading into the final month of the year, so it's unclear if that timeframe will still be met. We have reached out to Apple for an update on the matter.

<em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20231127PD223.html">DigiTimes</a></em> claims that there are a total of four different second-generation Vision Pro headsets in development, including a direct successor to the first-generation model and a more affordable model. The nature of the other two second-generation models is unclear.

<br/>
The bill of materials (BOM) for the more affordable headset will reportedly be half that of the first-generation Vision Pro to enable a significantly reduced retail price. Samples of this device are apparently set to begin production in the second half of 2024, with launch following in the second half of 2025 at the earliest.

<br/>
Alarm bells began ringing last week on Google's community support site when some users reported files <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606/google-drive-files-suddenly-disappeared-the-drive-literally-went-back-to-condition-in-may-2023?hl=en">mysteriously disappearing</a> from Google Drive, with some posters claiming six or months of data had vanished.

            Apple's 15-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> doesn't have a fan, and instead uses a passive heat spreader to conduct heat away from Apple's energy efficient <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip. Curious to know if performance could be further improved with an active cooling solution, <a href="https://www.froresystems.com">Frore Systems</a> installed its own novel solid-state active cooling system into the laptop and subjected it to several benchmarks, with some impressive results.

            I don&#8217;t know what it is about US law enforcement culture, but it far too often seems to be that officers deployed to help people choose to hurt people instead.

            Apple with iOS 17.1 and watchOS 10.1 introduced a new NameDrop feature that is designed to allow users to place Apple devices near one another to quickly exchange contact information. Sharing contact information is done with explicit user permission, but some news organizations and police departments have been spreading misinformation about how functions.

<p id="IBHA13">Google says it’s investigating Google Drive users’ reports claiming that their personal files have unexpectedly vanished from the cloud service. The company <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245861992/drive-for-desktop-v84-0-0-0-84-0-4-0-sync-issue">acknowledged the issue today</a> in a new Google community support thread and believes it involves a “limited subset” of Google Drive for desktop app users. Google notes it’s a sync issue for Google Drive desktop versions 84.0.0.0 through 84.0.4.0.</p>
