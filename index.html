            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If you've been following iPhone rumors over the last few years, you may remember reading reports that Apple flirted with the idea of introducing a super high-end "Ultra" model that would either <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/25/iphone-15-ultra-replacing-pro-max-model/">replace</a> its Pro Max device or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/05/gurman-new-top-of-the-line-iphone/">sit above it</a> in Apple's smartphone hirearchy. These reports appeared in the pre-launch iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 rumor cycles, but ultimately came to nothing. Now though, the rumor is back.

In the film, Brad Pitt stars as an F1 driver who was an up-and-coming talent in the 1990s, until an accident on the track nearly ended his career.

In the final sentence of an October 2024 <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/apple-celebrates-10-years-of-apple-pay/">press release</a>, celebrating the 10-year anniversary of Apple Pay, Apple said iPhone users in the U.S. would be able to see their PayPal balance when using their PayPal debit card in the Wallet app. Apple said this feature would launch in 2025, so it should arrive in a future iOS 18 or iOS 19 update.

Here is exactly what Apple said in the press release last year:<blockquote>Next year, customers in the U.S. will also be able to see their PayPal balance when using their PayPal debit card in Apple Wallet, giving them greater visibility and confi</blockquote> [...]<br>

            Two human rights groups have filed a legal complaint with the UK's Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) in an attempt to quash the UK government's demand for Apple to allow backdoor access to its encrypted data (via <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/330291f9-e765-47c1-8a29-f22a95674de9">Financial Times</a></em>).

The CMA's independent inquiry group's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/final-report-into-mobile-browsers-and-cloud-gaming-published">investigation</a> found that Apple's requirement for all iOS browsers to use its WebKit engine is stifling competition, and effectively prevents rival browsers from introducing unique features or optimizations on iPhones and iPads, regardless of their capabilities on other platforms.

<br/>
The iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are rumored to adopt a horizontal camera bar reminiscent of Google's Pixel series, and this bar is expected to span the width of the device's back, housing the triangular triple-camera setup on the left, and the flash, microphone, and LiDAR sensor on the right. It is not clear why Apple would use this design, nor what the extra space would be used for, but it has shown up several times now.
