            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-11 02:08:21-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple plans to release a MacBook Air with an improved LCD display in 2027, featuring Oxide TFT technology instead of the current amorphous silicon (a-Si) panels, according to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=32837">The Elec</a></em>.

<br/>
The new display technology is said to be a significant upgrade over current MacBook Air screens. Oxide TFT LCD panels offer better power efficiency and improved performance compared to traditional a-Si displays, resulting in sharper images, smoother scrolling, and enhanced battery life.
<br/>
<br/>
The transition to Oxide TFT technology should also mean faster pixel response times and more consistent brightness across the screen. In practical terms, this should translate to reduced motion blur when watching videos or gaming, and more uniform [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's first OLED MacBook Pro remains on schedule for a 2026 release, featuring the new slimmer design Apple is rumored to be working on, based on a new report from <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=32837">The Elec</a></em>.

<br/>
Samsung Display is said to be currently producing test samples of the OLED panels on its first deposition machine, which was installed in November 2024. However, industry projections estimate just 3 to 5 million OLED panels to be shipped annually for the MacBook Pro. Given that the supplier's IT 8th-generation OLED line is designed to produce 10 million units annually (based on 14.3-inch OLED panels), the company will need to secure additional customers to maximize its production efficiency.
