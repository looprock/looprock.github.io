            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-04 04:57:58-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple Music could get more visual flair in iOS 26 with full-screen animated artwork coming to the Lock Screen, according to <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/03/exclusive-ios-26-messages-carplay-more/">9to5Mac</a></em>.

<br/>
The rumored feature would expand on recent changes to the Lock Screen's Now Playing view. Currently, maximized album artwork from the Now Playing widget tints the entire interface, creating a more immersive experience when controlling music playback.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26 appears set to take that concept further by introducing animated artwork that fills the entire Lock Screen, making album covers and other visuals more dynamic and engaging.
<br/>
<br/>
The new iOS 26 features are expected to be unveiled at the WWDC keynote event on Monday, June 9. It starts at 10:00 a.m. and while Apple will  [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-04 04:37:51-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's Notes app is rumored to be getting Markdown support in iOS 26 and macOS 26, according to <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/03/exclusive-ios-26-messages-carplay-more/">9to5Mac</a></em>. The feature would allow users to format text using simple syntax rather than relying on the app's current rich text controls.

<br/>
Markdown support would be a major upgrade for power users who prefer keyboard-driven formatting. Instead of tapping buttons to bold text or create headers, users could type **bold** or # Header directly into their notes.
<br/>
<br/>
The addition would put Apple Notes on par with popular note-taking apps like Obsidian, Notion, and Bear, which have long supported the lightweight markup language. For developers and writers already familiar with Markdown from platforms like GitHub or Reddit, it w [...]<br>

<br/>
With WWDC just days away, de With – co-founder of photography app maker Lux and former Apple designer – has created what he calls "Living Glass" concepts that imagine interfaces matching the material properties of Apple's glass-screened devices.
<br/>
<br/>
"Philosophically, if I was Apple, I'd describe this as finally having an interface that matches the beautiful material properties of its devices," de With writes. "This brings an interface of a matching material, giving the user a feeling of the glass [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Samsung recently launched the Galaxy S25 Edge, a super thin smartphone that will compete with Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>. To see what it's like using such a thin phone, <em>MacRumors</em> video editor Dan Barbera used it as his main device for two weeks to see what it might be like to use Apple's equivalent later this year.

<br/>
The Galaxy S25 Edge has a 6.7-inch display, so it's a larger smartphone, but because it's so thin and light, it's easy to hold. It's just 5.8mm thick and it weighs 163 grams, and it's so light that it almost feels like a plastic dummy phone. Apple's ‌iPhone 17 Air‌ could be even thinner at 5.5mm, and it will have a similar display size at 6.6 inches, so it should be a lot like the S25 Edge.

            While the iPhone 17 series is still three months away from launching, rumors about next year's iPhone 18 models continue to surface.

<br/>
The latest word comes from Apple analyst Jeff Pu. In a research note with equity research firm GF Securities this week, Pu said that he expects the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and so-called iPhone 18 Fold to be equipped with Apple's A20 chip, and he believes the chip will have some key design changes over the A18 and upcoming A19 chips.
<br/>
<br/>
First, Pu reiterated that the A20 chip will be manufactured with TSMC's 2nm process. The current A18 Pro chip in iPhone 16 Pro models is fabricated with TSMC's second-generation 3nm process, while the A19 Pro chip for the iPhone 17 Pro models is expected to use TSMC's third-generation 3nm process.

<br/>
The two functions can be used together, but if it's just yourself dining out then you can just leave the People field set to 1. The steps below show you how it works.  
<br/>
<br/>
Note: If you see a standard percentage (%) button where the TIP button should be, you can change the calculator layout to replace it. Simply go to <strong>Settings ➝ Calculator</strong> and select <strong>Tip Function</strong> instead of <strong>Percent</strong>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple TV+ is emerging as the frontrunner to acquire additional MLB media rights currently held by ESPN, according to a <em><a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/06/02/apple-tv-emerging-as-leading-candidate-among-streamers-to-land-more-mlb-rights/">Sports Business Journal</a></em> report.

<br/>
Sources tell the publication that Apple's offer would likely exceed what NBC has proposed for the same package, particularly if focused on Sunday night games. NBC reportedly bid for all of ESPN's current MLB rights, but the league faces a familiar streaming dilemma: fewer dollars from traditional broadcasters with broader reach versus higher payments from digital platforms with smaller audiences.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-03 04:33:57-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WhatsApp has ended support for iOS versions older than iOS 15.1, removing the chat platform's compatibility with several iPhone models in the process. The change began on June 1, after Meta delayed it from an original planned date of May 5.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786421" height="1266" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Whatsapp-Feature.jpg" width="2250"/>
<br/>
WhatsApp is no longer compatible with iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus models. Users with those devices won't be able to access the encrypted chat service through the app unless they upgrade their iPhone. Alternatively, users can visit web.whatsapp.com in their browser, but the experience won't be the same.
<br/>
<br/>
Users who intend to upgrade can back up their WhatsApp chats to iCloud, and restore their full chat and media history to a newer, supported device using using WhatsApp's Chat Transfer feature. Instructions on how to do so are outlined in WhatsApp's &lt;a href="https://f [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            YouTube has updated its iOS app to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/youtube/id544007664?platform=iphone">version 20.22.1</a>, which now requires iOS 16 or later to install and run. The change means several older iPhone models are no longer officially compatible with the app.

<br/>
The affected devices are those that cannot upgrade beyond iOS 15 – namely, the iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and the first-generation iPhone SE. If you have an iPod touch 7, that will no longer run the app either.
<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, the YouTube app for iPad now requires iPadOS 16 or later, which means the app has discontinued support for the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 4.

Users with these older devices can still access YouTube through their web browser by visiting m.youtube.com, but the experience wo [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            A Chinese leaker with a mixed track record for accurate predictions has today disputed claims that the regular iPhone 17 and all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air will feature ProMotion displays.

<br/>
ProMotion has been limited to the Pro models since it debuted on the iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max in 2021, but several sources have suggested that Apple will this year fit the 120Hz variable refresh technology into the base iPhone 17 model, as well as the new iPhone 17 Air that replaces the Plus model in the lineup.
<br/>
<br/>
However, Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/5821279480/PuPiSAB0t">Fixed Focus Digital</a>'s sources apparently tell them that the panel being used in the upcoming non-Pro models is "just a standard 120Hz screen, not ProMotion with adaptive refresh rate."
