Released today for its iOS app, the new feature allows people to set their cookie preferences once at the browser level rather than responding to prompts on every website.

The new system is designed to address the common frustration with cookie consent banners, which studies show approximately 70% of users either ignore or dismiss without reading.

            Samsung kicked off its <a href="https://howl.link/0ufxm5ick33dz">Cyber Week sale</a> a few days ago, offering discounts across smartphones, smartwatches, tablets, computers, and home appliances. Many of the deals in this sale are the same prices we tracked during Samsung's Black Friday sale, making Samsung one of the few retailers to keep these best-ever prices around all week.

The first SE model was based on the design of the ‌iPhone‌ 5s but packed the then-flagship A9 chip and latest camera technology.

Led by competition policy professor Sean Ennis, the suit alleges Apple's 15-30% commission on App Store sales creates an anti-competitive tax on the UK technology industry. The lawsuit seeks £785 million ($995 million) in damages on behalf of UK app developers. The case could potentially benefit up to 13,000 developers who have sold apps or in-app subscriptions to iOS users since July 2017.
