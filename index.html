            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If you open up Spotify's desktop app on a Mac or PC today, things should look a lot more "mobile." That's because the company has redesigned the "Your Library" and "Now Playing" interfaces to make them more aligned with Spotify's smartphone app. 
<br/>

<br/>
"Your Library" is now located in the sidebar to let you access saved music and podcasts. Spotify says its research has shown that the new library helps users save time by providing a better overview, while making it easier to switch between playlists.  Users can also now move and pin the playlists in the Library, as well as drop songs into the editable listed playlists. 
<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere, the "Now Playing" view takes up the right-hand side of the app, showing the currently playing song or podcast. &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-06-20/spotify-desktop-experien [...]<br>

Chrome for iOS now uses AI to detect addresses on webpages and show a location directly on a mini version of the Google Maps app in Chrome, so there's no need to swap apps to see map-related information about a search term.

Google Calendar events can be created directly in Chrome without needing to swap apps. Chrome users can press and hold on a detected date and choose the option to add it to Google Calendar. The Chrome app will automatical [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In this chapter we have to ask ourselves whether, in any sense at all, there is such a thing as matter. Is there a table which has a certain intrinsic nature, and continues to exist when I am not looking, or is the table merely a product of my imagination, a dream-table in a very prolonged dream? This question is of the greatest importance. For if we cannot be sure of the independent existence of objects, we cannot be sure of the independent existence of other people's bodies, and therefore still less of other people's minds, since we have no grounds for believing in their minds except such as are derived from observing their bodies. Thus if we cannot be sure of the independent existence of objects, we shall be left alone in a desert—it may be that the whole outer world is nothing but a dream, and that we alone exist.<br>

However, movies and episodes are not atomic units, but rather composed of smaller elements such as frames, shots, scenes, sequences, and acts. Understanding these elements and how they relate to each other is crucial for tasks such as video summarization and highlights detection, content-based video retrieval, dubbing quality assessment, and video editing.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            After having "multiple conversations" with companies within Apple's supply chain this week, Barclays analysts Blayne Curtis and Tom O'Malley believe that Apple is unlikely to release a fourth-generation iPhone SE in 2024.
<br/>

<br/>
In a research note shared with <em>MacRumors</em>, the analysts said Apple's decision not to launch a new iPhone SE next year could indicate that the company's rumored in-house 5G modem will not be ready any time soon, which would benefit Apple's existing iPhone modem supplier Qualcomm. Apple has reportedly been planning its own modem since at least 2018, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/25/apple-intel-acquisition/">acquired the majority of Intel's smartphone modem business</a> in 2019.
