            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            OpenAI is considering acquiring the AI hardware startup founded by former Apple design chief Jony Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, according to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-discussed-buying-jony-ive-sam-altmans-ai-device-startup">The Information</a></em>. The deal could be worth at least $500 million.

The venture, known as "io Products," is developing AI-powered devices that could include a "phone" without a screen and other AI-enabled household products, according to people will direct knowledge of the talks. That's despite people close to the project apparently insisting it is "not a phone."

            When most people make a serious mistake that harms someone else, they try to fix it. That&#8217;s basic human decency. But when the Trump administration admits to &#8220;mistakenly&#8221; trafficking someone with protected status to an El Salvador slave labor camp, their response is to mock the judge who ordered them to try to fix it.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is likely to take a multi-pronged approach to manage the impact of impending tariffs on its products, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-04-06/will-apple-raise-iphone-prices-in-the-us-after-trump-tariffs-iphone-17-details"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. The company faces looming challenges, as new tariffs will affect not just China-based production but also the very countries Apple has diversified into.

<br/>
The upcoming tariffs range from 20% to 46% across Apple's global manufacturing hubs. India, where Apple increasingly builds iPhones and AirPods, will face a 26% tariff. Vietnam, which produces AirPods, iPads, Apple Watches and Macs, will be hit with a 46% levy. Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and even Ireland will face tariffs between a 20% and 37%.

Given analyst and economist responses to the tariffs, market panic, and Trump's stance on the current financial chaos, the answer is that making a purchase immediately might save you some cash if things don't change.
