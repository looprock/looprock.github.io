            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models will have several new camera-related features, according to an anonymous tipster who contacted <em>MacRumors</em> today.
<br/>

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010582" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iPhone-17-Pro-on-Desk-Centered-1.jpg" width="2500"/>

The tipster claimed to be familiar with an iPhone 17 Pro commercial that is allegedly being produced by a film company that has publicly listed Apple as one of its clients. <em>MacRumors</em> has not independently confirmed any of the information shared by the tipster, so skepticism is obviously warranted for now.
<br/>
<br/>
The tipster revealed three alleged iPhone 17 Pro features that have not been rumored previously:<ul><li>An upgraded Telephoto lens with up to <strong>8× optical zoom</strong>, compared to up to 5× optical zoom on the iPhone 16 Pro models. The lens can apparently move, allowing for continuous optical zoom at various focal lengths.</li></ul> [...]<br>

            It seems to be part of human nature to try to game systems. That’s also true for technological systems, including the most recent iteration of AI, as the numerous examples of prompt injection exploits demonstrate.

            Like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, iPadOS 26 adopts Apple's new Liquid Glass material, for an interface that's glossy, shiny, and more transparent than before. But Liquid Glass isn't the biggest change that Apple made to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>'s software. Multitasking got a much needed revamp that lets you use an ‌iPad‌ like a Mac, if that's what you want to do.
