            <h1><em>Balancing Engineering Ambition with Product Realism</em></h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In July of 2023, Etsy’s App Updates team, responsible for the Updates feed in Etsy’s mobile apps, set off with an ambitious goal: to revamp the Updates tab to become Deals, a home for a shopper’s coupons and sales, in time for Cyber Week 2023.</p>
<p>The Updates tab had been around for years, and in the course of its evolution ended up serving multiple purposes. It was a hub for updates about a user’s favorite shops and listings, but it was also increasingly a place to start new shopping journeys. Not all updates were created equal. The most acted-upon updates in the tab were coupons offered for abandoned cart items, which shoppers loved.</p>
<p>We spotted an opportunity to clarify intentions for our users: by refactoring favorite-based updates into the Favorites tab, and (more boldly), by recentering Updates and transforming it into a hub for a buyer’s deals.</p>

            OpenAI has announced a new Read Aloud feature for its official ChatGPT app for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> that allows users to have the chat bot read responses out loud in one of five voice options.

<br/>
Personas and EyeSight are Vision Pro additions that many people have poked fun at since the headset's release. Personas are a digital representation of the user that's shown in video calls, while EyeSight uses an external display to show the Vision Pro wearer's eyes if there are other people in the room. Personas and EyeSight are aimed at making the Vision Pro less of an isolating experience, but neither has been particularly well-received.
