            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            There have been several alleged leaked details of the iPhone 17 Air, Apple's rumored new slim iPhone, but images have been limited to grainy shots taken in component factories.

In terms of size, rumors suggest the iPhone 17 Air will have a 6.6- [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Square Enix <a href="https://na.finalfantasy.com/news/2719">today announced</a> that iOS game Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles is shutting down immediately, due to some kind of in-app purchase bug.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-989993" height="713" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/final-fantasy-crystal-chronicles.jpg" width="1267"/>
<br/>
Apparently customers have been unable to access content purchased in the iOS app for the last several weeks, which Square Enix says is "due to changes made to the in-app purchases model." Apple hasn't made any known changes to in-app purchases in recent months, so it is not clear what Square Enix is referencing given the limited information provided.
<br/>
<br/>
Further, the company says that it is "unable to completely fix the bug and implement the new changes," which means support for Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and &lt;a href="https://www.macr [...]<br>

Powerbeats Pro 2 feature the same H2 chip from the AirPods Pro 2, enabling Active Noise Cancellation, which is a feature the original Powerbeats Pro lack. Another key feature is heart rate monitoring, with each earbud featuring LED optical sensors that can pulse at over 100 times per second to measure heart rate via blood flow. This feature works with supported fitness apps like the Peloton app and Nike Run Club.

The display could be a new version of the Studio Display that Apple first introduced in 2022. The current version of the Studio Display uses a 5K LED panel, so a mini-LED version would be a significant update.

To achieve this, GPT-5 will integrate multiple OpenAI technologies, including o3, which will no longer be available as a standalone model. Meanwhile, the free tier of ChatGPT will get unlimited access to GPT-5 at a "standard intelligence setting [...]<br>
