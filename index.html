But the government’s relationship with it is complicated.</p> <p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="jNANp5">As Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner Group, was marching toward Moscow in late June, all eyes were on one platform: Telegram.

Prigozhin himself dramatically narrated his revolt through voice messages to his 1.3 million followers.</p> [...]<br>

            Former Apple design chief Sir Jony Ive has revealed his latest project, a collaboration with British audio brand Linn to design a <a href="https://www.linn.co.uk/uk/turntables/lp12-50">50th anniversary edition of its Sondek LP12 turntable</a>.

<br/>
The luxury $60,000 record player is the first non-Apple hardware project Ive is known to have been involved in since he and four other colleagues <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/06/27/jony-ive-leaving-apple/">left the company</a> in 2019 to found the design firm LoveFrom. 
<br/>
<br/>
The premium piece of audio technology features many of the classic hallmarks of an Ive-approved product, right down to the smoothed off aluminum edges, circular elements, and neutral, minimalist aesthetic.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today updated its Shazam music recognition app to allow it to recognize and identify songs that are playing in third-party apps like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-857861" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/08/shazam-for-mac.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
According to Apple, users can open up Shazam, tap the blue button, and switch back to the app that was in use to see what's playing. The Shazam app engages the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s microphone to hear the song, and it is able to listen while the other app is in use. After a few seconds, the song will be identified and swapping back to Shazam will show the song name and information.
<br/>
<br/>
It is simpler to use the built-in Song Recognition feature in the ‌iPhone‌'s Control Center to identify a song. With Song Recognition, you can open up an app like YouTube, play a song, swipe into Control Center, and ta [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Whether your iPhone or iPad is long overdue a battery replacement, or you just want to get more juice out of a single charge, here's a way to keep your device's Low Power Mode on all the time.
<br/>

<br/>
Most ‌iPhone‌ and iPad users will be familiar with the way their device throws up a prompt to turn on Low Power Mode when the battery falls to 20 percent. The special mode conserves what remaining battery life the device has left by limiting some features, but by default the mode automatically turns off when a charging iPhone or iPad reaches 80 percent. If that irks you, don't worry – there is a solution.

Perhaps you're running the latest version of iOS or iPadOS on an older device and you've found that the battery life is inadequate to get you through the day. Or maybe you just want to reduce the amount [...]<br>
