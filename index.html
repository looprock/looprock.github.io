            <b>Published:</b> 2026-01-07 08:01:19-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Spotify is bringing its long-running Listening Activity feature to its mobile apps, so now you can see what your friends are listening to on the streaming service when you're away from your desk.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031588" height="2160" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/spotify-messages-profile@2x.jpg" width="3840"/>
<br/>
For years, Spotify's desktop app has allowed users to check on their friends' listening habits via a Friend Activity sidebar, but the ability has not been available on iOS and Android apps until now. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you're familiar with Listening Activity, its appearance on mobile shouldn't throw up any real surprises. You can view what people are listening to in the app's sidebar, next to any messages, and you can tap the track to listen to it yourself, add it to your library, or react to it with emoji.
<br/>
<br/>
The feature remains opt-in, and can be enabled in the app's settings, under "Privacy and social." Ther [...]<br>

            Dell announced the UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor at CES 2026, billing it as the "world's first 52-inch 6K display."

<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031579" height="2160" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/dell-52-ultrawide-6k-thunderbolt@2x.jpg" width="3840"/>
<br/>
At 52 inches, the ultra-wide curved monitor features a 21:9 aspect ratio with 6,144 x 2,560 resolution at 129 pixels per inch and supports refresh rates up to 120Hz.
<br/>
<br/>
The display uses IPS Black panel technology for deeper blacks and improved contrast compared to standard IPS panels, with brightness listed as 400 cd/m. Dell says it emits up to 60% less blue light than competing monitors while maintaining professional-grade color accuracy, and it includes an ambient light sensor for eye comfort during extended use.

The display's connectivity support is pretty eye-watering, since it basically doubles as a Thunderbolt dock around the back. It includes one Thun [...]<br>

Logitech devices like its MX Master series mice and MX Keys keyboards stopped working properly as a result of the oversight, with users unable to access their custom scrolling setup, button mappings, and gestures. It wasn't long before the Logitech subreddit was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/logitech/comments/1c6oynm/logi_options_stuck_loading_forever/">awash with frustrated reports</a> as people discovered their configured peripherals had suddenly reverted to default settings.

            One of the most common refrains we hear from age verification proponents is that online ID checks are nothing new. After all, you show your ID at bars and liquor stores all the time, right?

The AI robot has a rolling base, a tube-shaped body, and flexible arms. SwitchBot says that it is designed to learn, adapt, and work in coordination with existing SwitchBot robots like vacuums. It does not have a single function, and is instead meant to adapt to multiple cleaning scenarios.

The pixel creature awakens once the sensor is placed in soil, and users can complete daily and weekly plant care missions to collect rewards and unlock new characters.

The AI and an accompanying app are meant to adapt to provide accurate readings across different plant species and pot types.
