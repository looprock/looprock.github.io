            Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/apple-announces-macbook-pro-models/">new MacBook Pro models</a> feature longer battery life thanks to the efficiency enhancements of the M4 family of chips, with some models and configurations reaching up to 24 hours—the longest ever offered in a Mac.

First introduced with the Pro Display XDR in 2019, nano-texture glass is etched at a nanometer scale, which is meant to preserve image quality while scattering ambient light to cut down on glare. It is the most matte display type that Apple makes, and Apple claims that it is useful for high-end, color-managed workflows or demanding ambient lighting environments.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Samsung is considering introducing a new premium smartphone brand that would exist alongside or even replace its iconic "Galaxy" branding, according to Korean publication <em><a href="https://www.etoday.co.kr/news/view/2413937">E-Today</a></em>.
<br/>

<br/>
The potential rebranding initiative reportedly aims to differentiate Samsung's high-end devices from its budget offerings. Currently, the company's broad use of "Galaxy" spans from entry-level Galaxy A and M series phones priced around $100-200 to premium Galaxy S flagships and Galaxy Z foldables that can cost upwards of $1,800.
<br/>
<br/>
Industry analysts suggest the wide price range under a single brand may dilute the premium perception of Samsung's high-end devices. The belief is that when consumers associate the Galaxy name with budget-friendly options, it becomes mo [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has reportedly designed a new AI-based system that will summarize reviews in the App Store to highlight the most common customer feedback for users before they download an app.

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-876046" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/app-store-awards-2022.jpg" width="1600"/>
