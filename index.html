<p id="7pkY3Q">DoorDash is making a big change to the way couriers get paid. In <a href="https://doordash.news/merchant/introducing-doordashs-biggest-app-updates-in-a-decade/">an announcement on Wednesday</a>, DoorDash says it will start giving couriers the ability to earn hourly rates on top of tips.</p>
<p id="naKkyu">With the update, couriers will now see the option to “earn by time,” which offers a guaranteed hourly minimum rate for the time they spend on making deliveries. According to DoorDash, the clock starts as soon as a courier accepts an order and ends when it’s dropped off. </p>
