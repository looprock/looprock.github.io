            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-27 07:45:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The upcoming iOS 18.4 update for the iPhone adds an Ambient Music feature to Control Center. Below, we take a closer look at how it works.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996862" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iOS-18-4-Ambient-Music-Control-Center.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
iOS 18.4 is currently in beta, so the Ambient Music feature is not widely available yet. The update will likely be released to the general public <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/ios-18-4-next-week/">next week</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
To use the feature on iOS 18.4, open Control Center and tap on the plus sign in the top-left corner. Then, tap on "Add a Control" at the bottom of the screen, scroll down to the Ambient Music section, and add one or more of the controls.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is how Apple describes the four Ambient Music themes:<ul><li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Music for a restful sleep.</li>
<br/>
<li><strong>Chill:</strong> Music for relaxation.&lt;/li</li></ul> [...]<br>

The USB-C to USB-C cable supports 60W fast charging, and it has USB 2.0 data transfer speeds of up to 480 Mbps, according to one of the listings.

            Apple regularly refreshes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> models, and a new version that uses M5 series chips is in the works. Apple just finished refreshing most of the Mac lineup with M4 chips, and now it's time for the M5. Rumors suggest that we could see the first M5 ‌MacBook Pro‌ models this fall.

<h2>Design</h2>
<br/>
There have been no rumors of a design update for the M5 ‌MacBook Pro‌ models that are coming this fall, so we are expecting the same look as the current models. There might be minor updates, but most of the changes will be internal.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple probably won't change the design of the ‌MacBook Pro‌ until it transitions to OLED display technology, and that's not rumored to happen until 2026 at the earliest.

            Utah today passed the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> Accountability Act, a law that requires mobile app stores from Apple and Google to verify the age of users rather than having individual apps do age verification.

It is the first law related to mobile app store age verification that has passed in the U.S., and it will require Apple to verify user age when an Apple Account is created. If a child under the age of 18 opens an account, Apple will need to link the account to a parent's account, and parents will have to consent to app purchases.

The Lumon Terminal Pro is designed to look similar to the machines that Severance employees like Mark S. and Helly R. use for macrodata refinement. The Terminal features a blue keyboard, a small display with wide bezels, and a trackball for navigation purposes.

In a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/sessions/2025-03-14/apple-s-2025-plans-and-strategy-live-q-a">live-streamed Q&amp;A session</a> today, Gurman said that Apple currently has no plans to reintroduce a smaller iPhone model.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple discontinued the iPhone 13 mini <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-iphone-13-mini/">in September 2023</a>, and it has not offered a mini model since then. Apple is not expected to release an iPhone 17 mini this year, and Gurman's revelation likely rules out an iPhone 18 mini next year too, given Apple's multi-year planning and development cycle for future iPhone models.
