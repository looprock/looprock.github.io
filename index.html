Updated Apple backend code found by <em>MacRumors</em> includes a reference to a "Dual Knit Band," which is not a band that exists at the current time. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> comes with a Solo Knit Band and a Dual Loop Band, but no Dual Knit Band.

Based on the name, the new band could be a cross between Apple's two existing bands, featuring the same comfortable material as the Solo Knit Band but with a more supportive two-band fit. A text description of the Dual Knit Band suggests that there will be an upper band that spans the top of the head and another band that fits behind th [...]<br>

Apple just debuted the ‌AirPods Pro 3‌, adding new features like improved active noise cancellation, the U2 chip, and heart rate monitoring.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-03 03:39:49-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The MacBook Air is Apple's most popular laptop – a thin, fanless machine that wields quiet power thanks to the efficiency of Apple silicon. While the M4 model isn't exactly old, attention is already turning to its successor.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1009086" height="1408" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/macbook-air-prime-day-2025.jpeg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Apple doesn't telegraph new product launches ahead of time, but we can draw a surprisingly clear picture of what to expect by looking at Apple's silicon roadmap, release cycles, and past upgrades.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Release Timing and Price</h2>
<br/>
Apple appears to have settled into a spring refresh cycle for the MacBook Air. After releasing the M2 model in mid-2022 with an all-new design, Apple skipped 2023 and then delivered back-to-back M3 and M4 MacBook Air updates in March 2024 and March 2025, respectively.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, Apple Maps has a feature called Visited Places that when enabled automatically logs where you've been, with the aim of making it easier to revisit your favorite spots or to share locations with friends. 
<br/>
<br/>

While it can be useful for tracking your travels, you might prefer to keep your location history private. Here's how to disable the feature and clear your history.

<br/>
<h2>What Is Visited Places?</h2>
<br/>
Visited Places keeps a record of locations you've visited, organizing them by category such as restaurants, shops, or transit stops. The feature is end-to-end encrypted, so Apple can't read your data, and it syncs across all your Apple devices signed into the same account.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Nearly two weeks after the iPhone 17 series launched, analysts at investment banking firm Morgan Stanley said demand for the devices has been "modestly stronger than we originally expected," based on a combination of extended shipping estimates on Apple's online store and information it gathered from Apple's supply chain.

There has been strong early demand for the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max, according to the analysts. However, they said the ultra-thin iPhone Air has faced "relative weakness" in demand so far.
