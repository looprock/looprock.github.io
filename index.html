            <b>Published:</b> 2024-05-16 04:51:51-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            This year's upcoming iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to get a boost in overall size from 6.7-inches to 6.9-inches, and a new image gives us a good idea of how the current iPhone 15 Pro Max compares to what could be Apple's largest ever iPhone.

<br/>
The image above, <a href="https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1790739293721231880">posted on X by Majin Bu</a>, shows a dummy model representing the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max alongside an actual iPhone 15 Pro Max. Dummy units are designed to take the place of real devices for display or testing purposes, and therefore seek to match the dimensions and design changes of yet-to-be-released iPhones.
<br/>
<br/>
With the increase in size of Apple's larger premium model rumored to be in the region of 0.2 inches, the difference is visually noticeable, but whether it will be al [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iPhone users often find themselves toggling between different keyboard layouts to type messages, emails, or fill out forms. This can slow down communication and disrupt your flow. But there are ways to streamline the process. If this quick tip is new to you, it could revolutionize the way you type on your iPhone and save you precious time.

<br/>
Switching away from the alphabetic keyboard layout when you need to type a number or symbol is an all-too-often occurrence on ‌iPhone‌, so here's a quick tip for making the transition super-swift.
<br/>
<br/>
Rather than tap the "123" key in the bottom-left corner to switch to the number/symbol keyboard, hold down on the key and then slide your finger over to the number/symbol that you want to type, then let go.

This single action types the number/symbol <em>an</em> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has new Smart Folio cases for its latest M4 iPad Pro and M2 iPad Air models that boast a wider range of viewing angles, and thanks to Marques Brownlee, we now know how it's done.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
With the help of some magnet paper, MKBHD <a href="https://x.com/MKBHD/status/1790718481102434503">reveals</a> that Apple has added bigger, more cubic magnets to the M4 iPad Pro that align with a new longer rail of stripe magnets in the Folio Case, thereby achieving a wider range of viewing angle adjustment.
<br/>
<br/>
The magnet paper also reveals that, because of how thin the new iPad Pro is compared to the previous generation model, Apple has had to use flatter, more circular speaker drivers, which appear to be closer to the top of the device.

When the 80% hard limit is enabled, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> will never charge beyond that percentage, except on rare occasions to "maintain accurate battery state-of-charge estimates," according to Apple.
