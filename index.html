            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple released the fourth beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> today, and the company has continued making changes to the way that Liquid Glass looks. There are also new features, including the return of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> Notification Summaries for news. This beta is of particular interest because it's likely the beta that public beta testers will get in the not too distant future.

            Apple may be developing a sleep score feature for the Apple Watch, based on code found in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> by <em><a href="https://x.com/SteveMoser">MacRumors</a></em> contributor Steve Moser.

An image buried in the Health app code features an Apple Watch with an "84" on it. Around the sides of the number, there are three bars that are the same colors as some of the sleep stages that can be tracked with the Apple Watch. The orange could represent time awake, the lighter blue may correspond with REM sleep, and the darker blue could be Core or Deep sleep.
<br/>
<br/>
The watch graphic is surrounded by sleep-related icons that Apple uses in different places in iOS, including a moon and stars, a "zzz," a bed, an icon representing sleep stages, an alarm clock, and in one spot, [...]<br>

            In the fourth beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, there's some curious wording for a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> setting that references a ‌HomePod‌ with a display, perhaps hinting at a future product that could come out sometime in the not too distant future.

<br/>
There’s a location-related setting that has the following wording:
<br/>
<blockquote>Your HomePod won't be able to show you the local weather, time, or respond to Siri requests about your area.</blockquote>
<br/>
"Show" is an interesting word for Apple to choose, because right now, the ‌HomePod‌ isn't able to show anything like the weather or the time because it doesn’t have a screen to display the information.
