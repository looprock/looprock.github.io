            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-14 12:52:36-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            A little more than three months ago, <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613">Aaron Perris</a> discovered references to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/ios-26-all-the-little-changes/">unreleased "Weather via satellite" feature</a> in the code for the first iOS 26 developer beta. However, just one day before iOS 26 is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/14/ios-26-available-tomorrow/">set to be widely released</a>, the feature has yet to be released or even announced by Apple.
<br/>

<br/>
The references have not been removed from the code, as of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/apple-seeds-ios-26-rc/">iOS 26 Release Candidate</a>, so it is possible that Apple will introduce the feature eventually. Perhaps the feature will be added in a follow-up update, such as iOS 26. [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-14 12:26:11-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 26 will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/14/ios-26-available-tomorrow/">widely released tomorrow</a>, but the new feature that lets you add a digital version of your U.S. passport to Apple's Wallet app is still not available.

<br/>
The "Digital ID" feature is not functional in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/apple-seeds-ios-26-rc/">iOS 26 Release Candidate</a>, which is typically the final beta version, despite being listed on the <a href="https://www.apple.com/os/ios/">iOS 26 features page</a> in the present tense. Hopefully, it is either enabled with a server-side update when iOS 26 is released tomorrow, or Apple provides an update on when it will be available.

Apple did not immediately respond to our request for comment.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-14 11:48:59-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Last week, we listed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/10/airpods-pro-3-features/">eight new AirPods Pro 3 features</a>, including a U2 chip in the charging case. The addition of the U2 chip has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1ng3822/airpods_pro_3_have_the_u2_chip_in_the_case_now/">receiving a lot of attention</a> since then, so we wanted to single out its inclusion and discuss it in more detail.

<br/>
Until now, Apple only referred to the U2 chip as a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, but it is <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods/compare/">no longer shying away</a> from using a name that might remind Apple fans of the free U2 album that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2014/10/14/u2-apologizes-for-auto-downloads/">infamously added to everyone's iTunes account</a> in 2014.

There were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/30/iphone-17-metalens-rumor/">conflicting rumors</a> about whether the iPhone 17 Pro models would have a smaller Dynamic Island, but its size did not change. Now, the rumor is back on the table for the iPhone 18 series, and there is a decent chance it will be true this time around, as it would be a stepping stone towards the rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/11/apple-iphone-air-interview/">20th-anniversary all-glass iPhone</a>.

            Five Years Ago This week in 2020, we learned about how the White House supposedly blocked Walmart from buying TikTok, and we asked why amidst all the fear around the site, nobody was equally worried about advertising tech and location data sales. GOP Senators released the latest stupid attempt to reform Section 230, the FISA [&#8230;]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In case you missed it, Apple's event this week included another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKphYoxGeRE">heartwarming video</a> about the Apple Watch's genuine life-saving potential.

The video is titled "Dear Apple," in reference to the emails the company receives from Apple Watch customers who were alerted to health conditions, or were helped by features like Emergency SOS and Crash Detection at critical moments.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>

"Real people share how Apple Watch has changed and even helped save their lives—a fitness story in New York, a teen's struggle with mental health in the UK and powerful health and safety stories from the U.S., Japan, and Canada," said Apple.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The latest iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and iPhone Air models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/iphone-17-n1-chip/">equipped with Apple's all-new N1 chip</a> for Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread connectivity. However, the chip has a Wi-Fi 7 bandwidth limitation.

<br/>
According to FCC documents reviewed by <em>MacRumors</em>, the N1 chip in all of the new iPhone models supports up to 160 MHz channel bandwidth for Wi-Fi 7, short of the standard's 320 MHz maximum. This limitation means the devices cannot achieve the peak theoretical speeds possible with Wi-Fi 7, but real-world performance is typically already bottlenecked by internet service providers and other factors.

            Apple today announced its <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/retail/hornsby/">store at the Westfield Hornsby shopping mall</a>, in Hornsby, Australia, will be permanently closing next month.

Hornsby is a suburb of Sydney, on the Upper North Shore. Apple opened its store there in 2011, and it will close for good on October 4, at 5 p.m. local time.

In a statement shared with some Australian media outlets a few months ago, Apple said it had decided not to renew its lease at Westfield Hornsby. Apple said all affected retail employees would be given the opportunity to work at Apple's nearby store <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/retail/chatswoodchase/">at the Chatswood Chase shopping mall</a>, in Chatswood, which is set to reopen in October.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-12 13:29:48-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 26 adds a new Hearing Protection setting for AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods Pro 3 in some countries across Europe and the Middle East, such as Belgium, Czechia, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Türkiye, and the United Arab Emirates.

<br/>
Specifically, there is a new "EN 352 Protection" setting in these countries. When this setting is turned on, Apple's website says the Hearing Protection feature on AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods Pro 3 complies with the European hearing protection standard EN 352, by limiting the maximum volume level of media playback to 82 dBA.
<br/>
<br/>
When a set of AirPods Pro 2 or AirPods Pro 3 are paired to an iPhone, this new setting can be turned on or off in the Settings app, by tapping on your AirPods, selecting Hearing Protection, and adjusting the "EN 352 Protection" toggle switch.

            The Apple Watch Series 11 is now available for pre-order. The latest models feature just four changes over their predecessors–making them perhaps the smallest generational upgrade in the device's history. Here's everything that's new.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-12 10:53:47-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max models in the U.S. feature an antenna window on the top edge of the devices, for mmWave 5G signals to pass through.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1018819" height="675" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/iPhone-17-Pro-mmWave-5G-Window.jpg" width="1200"/>
<br/>
The standard iPhone 17 does not appear to have the antenna window, while the iPhone Air does not support mmWave 5G, so it is not on that device either.
<br/>
<br/>
All of the iPhone 12 through iPhone 15 models are outfitted with this antenna window, made of glass. However, it was not present on any of the iPhone 16 models, which were the first devices to feature the Camera Control button on the bottom-right edge, where the mmWave 5G antenna window was previously located.
<br/>
<br/>
iPhone 17 Pro models have a new design with an aluminum unibody, but radio signals cannot pass through metal. The reintroduced antenna window, which likely remains made of glass  [...]<br>
