            <p>&lsquo;allowing for controversial yet eye-catching content like AI celebrities, OpenAI is borrowing from a playbook perfected by social media companies such as Meta: Do whatever it takes to get users on the app and ask forgiveness later, said Thales Teixeira, a business professor at the University of California at San Diego. “First you grow, and then you try to solve the problems,” he said.”&rsquo;  // Norms arbitrage and breaking the law is a standard business innovation for tech startups.</p>

            <p>If you make huge changes to how your under performing business works, there&rsquo;s a good chance you&rsquo;ll improve things. That applies whether you introduce a new tool - like AI - or not. Just changing how you run meetings for example is a big enough change that could have massive effects. You could say the same thing for introducing Extreme Programming, a lean mindset, DevOps. // The value of enterprise technology is inversely  proportional to how little you need to change the &ldquo;culture.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Using an AI chat desk to augment the support desk for a Us county. This seems like a basic packaging of AI stuff that you could sell to thousands of places. It probably also exposes the redundancy and waste on the US Federalist system. E.g., does every county and city need different bulk trash pickup processes and PDF overviews?</p>

Samsung already showed off the Project Moohan AR/VR headset back in January, and it looks a lot like the Vision Pro. It has a display that resembles a set of ski goggles, just like the Vision Pro, and a soft, fabric seal that fits against the face. There's a single padded strap that has a knob at the back for adjusting fit. As with the Vision Pro, Samsung's headset uses an external battery that's meant to be carried in a pocket.

If you have the latest iOS 26.1 beta, you can go to Settings &gt; Display and Brightness to get to the new option. Tap on Liquid Glass, then choose "Tinted." The Tinted option increases the opacity of Liquid Glass UI elements and improves contrast, while the Clear option is the standard Liquid Glass look.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-20 11:37:31-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The fourth beta of iOS 26.1 includes an option to turn off the Lock Screen swipe that activates the camera, a feature that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users have been wanting for years.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1023906" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/lock-screen-swipe-disable-camera.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
In the Camera section of the Settings app, there's a Lock Screen Swipe to Open Camera setting, and turning it off disables the feature where you can swipe left to open the camera.
<br/>
<br/>
The ‌iPhone‌ has long allowed users to open the Camera app directly from the Lock Screen with a swipe, but it can be a setting that's easy to activate, and it provides a way for someone that gets ahold of an ‌iPhone‌ to use it to take unwanted photos. 
<br/>
<br/>
There was previously no way to turn off Lock Screen camera activation without disabling the camera app entirely.  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the fourth betas of iOS 26.1, iPadOS 26.1, and macOS 26.1, Apple has introduced a new setting that's designed to allow users to customize the look of Liquid Glass.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1023903" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/10/ios-26-1-liquid-glass-opaque.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
The toggle lets users select from a clear look for Liquid Glass, or a tinted look. Clear is the current Liquid Glass design, which is more transparent and shows the background underneath buttons, bars, and menus, while tinted increases the opacity of Liquid Glass and adds more contrast.
<br/>
<br/>
The new setting can be found on iOS and iPadOS by going to Settings &gt; Display and Brightness, or System Settings &gt; Appearance on the Mac.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that the new toggle was added because during the beta testing period over the summer, user feedback suggested that some people would prefer to have a more opaque option for Liquid Glass. Th [...]<br>
