<br/>
Apple in June 2023 announced it was bringing its own journaling app to iOS 17, and it is finally here as part of Apple's December software update, iOS 17.2. 
<br/>
<br/>
Apple's Journal app lets you record your daily thoughts and activities, incorporating data like photos, music listened to, workouts, and more, plus it suggests topics to write about.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Creating Your First Journal Entry</h2>
<br/>
The Journal app has a simple, straightforward interface. When you open it up, you're presented with a "+" button, and tapping on it lets you start a new entry. When you have added a few entries, the button at the top-right lets you filter them based on photos and activities [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> has won its antitrust lawsuit against Google, after the nine-member jury in the case unanimously agreed that the tech giant abused its power by operating an app store monopoly and charging developers unduly high fees.

<br/>
The unanimous verdict came after three hours of deliberation following a four-week trial looking into Google's Play store. Among Epic's allegations were that Google illegally tied together its Play store and Play Billing payment services, leaving developers having to use both for their apps to be included in the store.
<br/>

Google collects a commission ranging from 15% to 30% on transactions completed within apps, similar to how Apple takes its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> fees.

Apple's Vision Pro headset is expected to be released around March 2024. Until then, one way you can prepare for it is to use your iPhone to record videos in a special format called spatial video that is made to be viewed on Apple's headset.

<br/>
When viewed on iPhone, spatial video appear as normal videos, but they provide an immersive viewing experience on Vision Pro that is almost three-dimensional. Combined with advanced computational videography techniques and HEVC compression, spatial memories are saved in a relatively compact file size, recorded at 30 frames per second at 1080p, and taking up to 130MB of s [...]<br>
