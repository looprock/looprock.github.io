            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's Mac mini has long been a powerhouse in a compact form, offering impressive performance in a small package. With rumors swirling about a completely overhauled new model that is likely just days away from being announced, anticipation is building for what Apple has in store. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961276" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/M4-Mac-mini-Silver-Perspective.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
From enhanced connectivity to major hardware upgrades, the upcoming Mac mini promises to bring significant improvements that make it more compelling than ever. Here are five reasons to get excited about the next generation of this beloved small form-factor desktop. 
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Major Redesign</h2>
<br/>
Apple is planning to debut completely redesigned Mac mini models, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/mac-mini-to-become-smallest-ever-apple-computer/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. The new ‌Mac mi [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-10-23 06:11:37-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has abruptly reduced production of the Vision Pro headset and could stop making the current version of the device completely by the end of 2024, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-sharply-scales-back-production-of-vision-pro"><em>The Information</em></a> reports.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Citing multiple people "directly involved" in making components for the headset, the report says that the scaling back of production began in the early summer. This indicates that Apple now has a sufficient number of Vision Pro units in its inventory to meet demand for the device's remaining lifespan through to next year.
<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro is widely reported to have seen weak demand due to insufficient content and its high price point. <em>The Information</em> says that Vision Pro suppliers have now produced enough components [...]<br>

<br/>
Apple previously announced that the 10-episode second season of "Severance" will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/10/apple-tv-plus-severance-season-2-date/">premiere on Friday, January 17</a>, and then one episode will follow every Friday through March 21.
