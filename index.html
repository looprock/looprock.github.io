Apple discontinued both the Intel-based 27-inch iMac and iMac Pro over the past two years, and it has yet to launch a larger-screen iMac with an Apple silicon chip as a replacement, leaving the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-imac-with-m3-chip/">recently-updated 24-inch iMac</a> with the M3 chip as its only all-in-one desktop computer.

            <p>Having 61 <a class="txt2html" href="https://momjian.us/main/presentations/selecting.html" style="text-decoration: none;">presentations</a> on my website, I am always looking for efficient ways to create them.  For presentations that focus on SQL
features, I have found the most efficient method is to first write the SQL queries in the order I want them to appear in my presentation.  I then run the queries through
<a class="txt2html" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html" style="text-decoration: none;"><em>psql,</em></a> and write its output to a text file.  Next, I import the file into my document editor, <a class="txt2html" href="https://www.lyx.org/" style="text-decoration: none;">LyX.</a>  I then add slide
headings, markup, colors, and supporting text.  Sometimes there are too many SQL queries to efficiently manage in a single file so I use multiple files and name them with numeric prefixes, e.g.,
<em>01, 02,</em> and concatenate them together before feeding them into <em>psql.</em></p> [...]<br>
