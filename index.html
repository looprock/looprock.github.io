<br/>
If you have a compatible iPhone model with a LiDAR Scanner (see the list below), you can measure a person's height in Apple's built-in Measure app. This way, you can see how much your nieces and nephews have grown since you last saw them, or find out if your favorite uncle is as tall as he claims he is. This might sound silly (it totally is!), but many people have no idea that iPhones offer this neat little feature.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Steps</h2><ol><li>Open the Measure app.</li>
<br/>
<li>Make sure the person is visible on your iPhone's screen from head to toe.</li>

<br/>
The forecast outlines a 3% year-over-year increase in global TWS unit shipments for 2025, signaling a transition from rapid growth to a more mature phase for the category. While Apple is set to remain the leading brand by revenue and brand recognition, the report suggests that volume growth will be led by lower-priced models under $50 from other brands, driven by emerging markets and replacement demand.

            Apple appears to have joined Meta-owned <a href="https://www.threads.com/@apple">social media site Threads</a>, two years after Threads first launched. Apple has a verified Threads profile and the @apple handle, but has yet to make any posts. Apple's account has 4.8 million followers, because of its existing followers on Instagram.

            DJI, best known for its line of drones, today announced the launch of <a href="https://store.dji.com/product/dji-power-2000">the Power 2000</a>, a portable power station. DJI already offers the Power 1000, and the Power 2000 is a larger, more capable version of the Power 1000.

I was able to test the Power 2000 before launch, to provide insight into the product for those who might be looking for a large power station option.

DJI's Power 2000 has a 2048Wh capacity with an LFP battery, double the capacity of the Power 1000. It's designed to power multiple devices or large appliances and equipment in emergencies, when off-grid, or when no traditional power source is available such as in a van living situation. It's $1,299, so it's not cheap, but it does seem to be priced competitively.
