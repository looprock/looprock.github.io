The website praised the inclusion of adhesive pull tabs for the battery cells in the new iPad Pro, as they make repairs easier.

We already shared <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/m4-ipad-pro-teardown/">another iPad Pro teardown video</a>, so the look inside the Apple Pencil Pro is the novel aspect here. Key hardware changes introduced with the Apple Pencil Pro include a gyroscope that allows you to rotate the accessory for precise control of shaped pen and brush tools, and a haptic engine that vibrates for certain actions. You can also track the location of the Apple Pencil Pro in the Find My app.
