            Apple silicon was <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/06/apple-announces-mac-transition-to-apple-silicon/">announced</a> five years ago this week, kickstarting one of the most successful periods for the Mac ever.

<br/>
Following years of rumors, Apple in June 2020 unveiled its plan to transition the entire Mac lineup from Intel processors to its own custom-designed chips.

Later that year saw the release of the first three Mac models powered by Apple silicon, including a 13-inch MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and Mac mini.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple had plenty of experience after a decade of making custom iPhone and iPad chips, and it was time for the Mac to switch from x86 to Arm architecture.
<br/>
<br/>
The company promised, and delivered, industry-leading performance per watt for Macs. This feat allowed it t [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> beta 2, Apple updated the location of the new tab icon in Safari, fixing a frustrating change that was made in the first ‌iOS 26‌ beta.

The initial ‌iOS 26‌ release introduced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/10/apple-ios-26-safari-design/">three view options</a> for the tab bar and it changed the look of the interface for managing all open tabs. The tab view significantly altered the placement of buttons, including the "+" button for a new tab.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In macOS Tahoe Beta 2, Apple included a new option to add a background to the menu bar, making it possible to have a menu bar design that’s similar to the menu bar in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1007714" height="1148" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/macos-tahoe-show-menu-bar-background.jpg" width="2041"/>
<br/>
As part of macOS Tahoe’s Liquid Glass design, Apple removed the background of the menu bar, so it blends into the wallpaper or background behind it. The icons of the menu bar are more free floating with the transparent look, though Apple does add a slight gradient to wallpapers to improve visibility.
<br/>
<br/>
The menu bar toggle is available in the System Settings app under the Menu Bar section. Turning it on clearly delineates the background from the menu bar for those that prefer the non-transparent aesthetic.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In the initial macOS Tahoe beta, Apple swapped the colors of the Finder icon, a longtime Mac classic. Rather than featuring blue on the left side of the face and light blue on the right side, the icon was primarily white and the right side of the face was blue.

The updated Finder look was a significant deviation from the design that Apple has used for Finder since 1996, and many Mac users were <a href="https://512pixels.net/2025/06/wwdc25-macos-tahoe-breaks-decades-of-finder-history/">unhappy with the change</a>.

            The second beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> includes a new ringtone that's an alternative to the classic "Reflection" ringtone that Apple uses as a default on iPhones.

Apple didn't give the new ringtone a special name, and it's just listed as "Alt 1" as an option if you tap into Reflection. You can get to the ringtone in ‌iOS 26‌ by opening up Sounds and Haptics in the Settings app, tapping on Ringtone, and then tapping on Reflection.

ICE&#8217;s tactics &#8212; unmarked vehicles, masked officers, and untargeted raids of any place that might contain foreigners &#8212; have earned it all the criticism and hatred it now faces.

<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/steve-moser/">Steve Moser</a> discovered the new setting within the code for the first watchOS 26 beta, and a Reddit user has seemingly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/watchos/comments/1ledm1e/show_data_when_locked/">found it in action</a>, but we have yet to figure out where it is exactly. Leave a comment if you know.

<br/>
The new privacy setting allows you to toggle on or off the ability to view data in the little "complications" that appear on select watch faces.

There is one exception: Apple says data from the Health app will never be visible in complications when an Apple Watch is locked, regardless of the toggle's position.
