<h2>Apple Plans to Release iOS 18.1 With Apple Intelligence on October 28</h2>
<br/>
iOS 18.1 has been in beta testing since before iOS 18.0 was released, as Apple has been working hard on refining the first Apple Intelligence features that will be included in the update, and it appears we now have a &lt;a href="https://www. [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            There have been multiple signs suggesting that Apple's mixed reality Vision Pro headset is struggling to take off, both due to the super high price and the heavy design that limits the amount of time it can be worn for most people. What does the Vision Pro's floundering mean for Apple's work on future virtual and augmented reality projects?

<br/>
<h2>Vision Pro Interest</h2>
<br/>
Interest in the Vision Pro was high in February when the device first launched because it was an all-new product category for Apple, but that didn't last. The Vision Pro is indisputably impressive, and it is mind blowing to watch a butterfly flit by so closely it feels like you can reach out and touch it, or to see the rough skin of an elephant as it walks right by you, but the magic quickly wears off for most.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18.1, there is a new option to set a "Primary" email address in the Settings app, which means it is easier to change the main email address associated with your Apple Account. The Primary email address is the one that is visible to other people when collaborating on and sharing documents, sending calendar invites, and more.

Apple did not previously make it easy to change an Apple Account (or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a>) email address, despite the fact that it is sometimes visible to other people.

            A few months ago, the SuperDrive <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/06/apple-superdrive-could-be-discontinued/">went out of stock on Apple's online store</a> in the U.S., and it is now listed as sold out or unavailable in all countries.

<br/>
Introduced in 2008, the SuperDrive is an external CD/DVD drive that was released alongside the original MacBook Air, which lacked a built-in CD/DVD drive. Despite having an outdated USB-A cable attached to it, the SuperDrive remained available on Apple's online store until just recently, becoming one of the company's longest-sold products.

Affected users said that the "passive entry" feature that allows you to lock, unlock, and start compatible BMW vehicle models by simply having your iPhone on you no longer works for secondary Wallet keys shared with others, such as a spouse or other family member. The primary key still works for passive entry, the people said.

            Apple today <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sph-M-6jNMo">shared a new ad</a> that highlights how artists used the iPad Pro and Apple Pencil Pro to design personalized artwork for seven NHL goalie masks being worn during the 2024-25 season. The artwork was then hand painted onto the masks.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The goalie masks were created for Jeremy Swayman of the Boston Bruins, Jacob Markström of the New Jersey Devils, Stuart Skinner of the Edmonton Oilers, Sam Montembeault of the Montréal Canadiens, Linus Ullmark of the Ottawa Senators, Joseph Woll of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and Thatcher Demko of the Vancouver Canucks.
<br/>
<br/>
NHL goalies have worn personalized masks for decades, but this is the first time that Apple has advertised becoming involved with the creative process.

At least some of the masks were designed in Adobe Photoshop, based on the images below.

Modern MacBooks can last 18 hours or more on a single battery charge, but like all rechargeable batteries, the one in your Mac has a finite lifespan. Over time, its capacity to hold a charge gradually diminishes, potentially leaving you tethered to a power outlet more often than you'd like. This is where understanding your Mac's battery cycle count can be important.

Checking your Mac's battery cycle count provides valuable insight into its overall health and remaining lifespan. A cycle count represents the number of times your battery has gone through a full charge cycle, which occurs when you use 100% of its capacity – whether in one sitting or sprea [...]<br>
