            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the next-generation version of iOS and other 2025 software updates, Apple is planning to change its numbering scheme. Rather than iOS 19, which would logically follow <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple is instead going to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-ios-26/">call the update iOS 26</a>. Apple plans to use 26 across all of its platforms (the number representing the upcoming year), which will presumably be less confusing than having iOS 19, macOS 16, watchOS 12, and visionOS 3. But what does the change mean for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>?

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-05-29 13:42:03-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has announced that its <a href="https://www.apple.com/nl/retail/denhaag">Den Haag store</a> in the Netherlands will be temporarily closed for renovations starting this Sunday, June 1.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003475" height="1612" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/Apple-Store-Den-Haag.jpeg" width="2880"/>
<br/>
The store is located in The Hague, the capital city of South Holland.
<br/>
<br/>
First opened in 2014, Apple Den Haag is one of the company's flagship stores, located in a covered walkway with historical architecture. The remodeled store will likely feature an Apple Pickup station for online orders, improved accessibility, and more.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not indicated when the store will reopen, but remodeling often takes months.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple has two other stores in the Netherlands, in Amsterdam and Haarlem.

We've heard a bit about the updated size before, but with most rumors focusing on the ‌iPhone 17 Air‌, it's easy to forget. Display analyst Ross Young today <a href="https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1928146088097349832">reiterated the screen sizes</a> expected for the entire ‌iPhone 17‌ lineup, and it serves as a good reminder about what to expect from Apple's lowest-priced flagship.
