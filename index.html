            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-29 07:58:15-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            On the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ford-ceo-jim-farley-on-china-tariffs-and-the-quest/id1011668648?i=1000729050198">latest episode of <em>The Verge</em>'s Decoder podcast</a>, released today, Ford CEO Jim Farley told guest host Joanna Stern that the automaker does not entirely like Apple's current implementation of its CarPlay Ultra software system for vehicles.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1001717" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/Apple-CarPlay-Ultra-instrument-cluster-themes-04.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
"We don't like the execution in round one of Ultra, but we're very committed to Apple," said Farley. "I've talked to [Apple CEO] Tim [Cook] many times about this."
<br/>
<br/>
Farley implied that Ford is currently passing on CarPlay Ultra because it would result in Apple having "control of the entire experience inside a vehicle."

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-29 07:27:14-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, Apple quietly added a neat new option that lets you send smaller-sized previews of images over Messages so that recipients get them right away, before the full-resolution images arrive. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010437" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iOS-26-Messages-Feature-2-1.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Thanks to the new setting, your recipient will receive a lower-quality preview almost instantly, followed by the full-resolution image. And if you're traveling with limited cellular data or using a metered data connection, they only get the compressed preview version – ensuring the original high resolution image doesn't hoover up your data. 
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Enable Send Photo Previews</h2>
<br/>
Apple has made this feature easy to toggle on or off depending on your needs. Here's how to enable it:
<br/>
<ol>
<br/>
<li>Open Settings on your iPhone.</li>
<br/>
<li>Scroll down and tap <strong>Apps</strong>.&lt;</li></ol> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Pre-orders for LG's new UltraFine evo 6K display (model 32U990A) with Thunderbolt 5 support will begin on September 30, according to a major U.S. retailer listing. 
<br/>

<br/>
LG first revealed the 32-inch display at CES 2025 in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/07/lg-unveils-ultrafine-6k-display-thunderbolt-5/">January</a>, teasing its status as the first monitor to support Thunderbolt 5. At the time, LG only provided high-level specs, but left pricing, availability, and full technical details unconfirmed. We can now fill in some of those details. 
<br/>
<br/>
The 32U990A features a 6,144 x 3,456 resolution Nano IPS Black panel with 224 pixels per inch. For comparison, the 32-inch Retina 6K display of Apple's Pro Display XDR outputs over 6,016 x 3,384 pixels, for a pixel density of 218 pixels per inch.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's next MacBook Pro models will enter mass production soon, according to the latest information shared by <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974025" height="2160" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-MacBook-Pro-M4-hero.jpg" width="3840"/>
<br/>
In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-28/apple-s-chatgpt-rival-m5-macbook-air-new-monitor-timing-ads-coming-to-maps-mg3ne6rw"><em>Power On</em> newsletter today</a>, Gurman said he continues to believe the new MacBook Pro models will be released at some point between late 2025 and the first quarter of 2026, meaning they should be available to order by March at the latest.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple often releases new Macs in October, but both Gurman and Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously said the next MacBook Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/10/no-m5-macbook-pro-2025/">might not arrive until early 2026</a>. Apple ann [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-28 13:30:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is preparing to release iOS 26.0.1, according to a private account on X with a proven track record of sharing information about future iOS versions.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020170" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/iOS-26.0.1-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
The account initially said iOS 26.0.1 would have a build number of 23A350, but they now expect the update to have a build number of 23A355. This suggests that the software update will include more bug fixes or changes than initially planned.
<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> has also seen evidence of iOS 26.0.1 in its visitor logs in recent days, as Apple's software engineers test the update internally.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26.0.1 will likely address a handful of software bugs and issues:<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/17/apple-iphone-17-camera-glitch-fix/">A camera-related bug</a> on the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro</li>
