We've already seen the design and some of the features, with rumors pointing to support for Spatial Audio, but the headphones' full specs were today shared by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/02/beats-solo4-specs/">9to5Mac</a></em> ahead of launch.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-04-02 12:41:52-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today introduced a new firmware update for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>. The new firmware is 6A325, up from the 6A324 firmware <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/30/apple-releases-6a324-firmware-for-airpods-max/">released in January</a>.

<br/>
Apple does not provide details on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware, so it is unclear what's new, and the notes often only list generic bug fixes. 
<br/>
<br/>
Apple also does not offer instructions on how to upgrade the software on the AirPods, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ are powered on and connected to an iOS device or a Mac.

You can check your ‌‌‌AirPods‌‌ Max‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ firmware by following these steps:
