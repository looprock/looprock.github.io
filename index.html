            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has until March 6 to fully comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act, which among other things will require the company to allow iPhone users to install apps outside of the App Store. With the deadline for this regulation fast approaching, it is likely that Apple will begin preparing for these changes with iOS 17.4.

<br/>
The first iOS 17.4 beta is expected to be released as early as this week, although it is unclear if the app-related changes will be rolled out for testing immediately, or held for later beta versions. Apple is expected to add support for both third-party app stores and app sideloading on the iPhone for users in <a href="https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/country-profiles_en">EU countries</a>, including Austria, Belgium, Italy, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sp [...]<br>

The efforts are part of the company's wider push to offer more health capabilities, embodied by the recent announcement of the Galaxy Ring, which touts activity and sleep tracking, with more health features set to arrive later. In a new interview, Samsung's mobile digital health chief Hon Pak said:<blockquote>If we can do continuous blood pressure and glucose, we're in a whole different ballgame.

In the humorous ad, a man takes a video of a child who is attempting to break a wood plank with his hand. The attempts are unsuccessful well into the night, and the ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus battery is able to record for hours. "Battery goes on and on," reads the tagline at the end of the video.
