            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, Apple's Spatial Scenes feature can transform ordinary photos into dynamic, three-dimensional pictures that respond to your movements. By adding depth and subtle motion to flat images, this clever AI-powered feature can bring to life photos in your iPhone's library – and your iPhone doesn't need Apple Intelligence to make use of it.

<h2>Spatial Scenes in the Photos App</h2>

Spatial Scenes works by intelligently separating subjects from backgrounds in your photos. When you move your iPhone, the foreground elements stay relatively stable while background elements shift slightly. This creates a parallax effect that mimics how your eyes naturally perceive depth.

<br/>
The feature works using generative AI that analyzes your photos to identify different elements and create depth maps. Importantly, it doe [...]<br>

            We have just a few more days to go until Apple's September 9 "Awe Dropping" event that will see the introduction of the Apple Watch Series 11. No design changes are expected this year, but there could be some internal updates.

<br/>
<h2 id="updated_modem">Updated Modem</h2>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Series 11 is rumored to be getting a MediaTek modem that supports 5G RedCap, a 5G service designed for wearables that don't need standard 5G speeds. 5G RedCap should still bring speed improvements over the LTE that's in the current Series 10.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="new_chip">New Chip</h2>
<br/>
Apple has a new S11 chip in store for the Series 11, but it will have the same processor as the Series 10. We're not expecting speed improvements, but the chip could be smaller, providing more space for other internal components.
