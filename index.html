Writing in the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, Gurman says Apple will replace the Lightning port for USB-C to comply with European regulations and for consistency across its AirPods lineup, but Apple does not plan to add the H2 chip and its attendant features like Adaptive Audio and Personalized Volume for the foreseeable future.

            Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-october-mac-event-2023/">upcoming "Scary Fast" event</a> takes place on October 30 (or 31, depending where you are) when it is expected to unveil new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, and a new 24-inch iMac. It may also make some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/usb-c-magic-mouse-expected-at-apple-event/">additional new products available</a>, but there are a handful of rumored upcoming devices that we don't expect to make an appearance this month.

            Apple earlier this week surprised us with an unexpected October event, and curiously, it is set to take place on Monday, October 30 at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time. Apple has never hosted a nighttime event before, so Monday should be quite interesting.

The "Scary Fast" event will be focused on the Mac, which has been confirmed by Apple's artwork for the event. On Apple's website, there is an Apple logo that morphs into the Mac Finder icon, so it's Macs that we're going to see.
<br/>

Rumors have been mixed about what we can expect at the event, but it's sounding like we'll get the entire M3 chip lineup. We've outlined what we've heard is coming, but we might also get some unexpected announcements.

<br/>
When users get directions for driving, walking, or cycling, Google Maps now offers a "multidimensional experience" that can be used to preview bike lanes, sidewalks, intersections, and parking along the route, <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/google-maps-october-2023-update/">according to Google</a>.

A time slider can be used to see air quality information and how the route looks as the weather changes throughout the day, while AI and historical driving trends simulate how many cars might be on the road at a given time.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) on Thursday ordered a ban on Apple Watch imports into the country after finding that Apple violated pulse oximetry company Masimo's patents with the devices (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-trade-tribunal-issues-potential-apple-watch-import-ban-masimo-patent-fight-2023-10-26/">Reuters</a></em>).

<br/>
The ban is now subject to presidential review, so it does not take effect immediately, and Apple can take the ban to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit after the 60-day review period ends. Presidents have rarely vetoed bans in the past.
