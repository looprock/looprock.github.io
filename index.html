<br/>
<br/>
According to Sensor Tower, Apple has apparently reduced digital advertising spending for the Vision Pro by more than 95% over the past year in key markets including the United States and United Kingdom. The report also no [...]<br>

<p>You can see the pattern and understand the root cause: ChatGPT can’t actually understand the rules of <em>Lasers &amp; Feelings</em> (in the sense of having the words of the rulebook create a mental model that it can then use independent of the words) and, therefore, cannot truly use them. It can only generate a sophisticated pattern of babble, guessing what the next word of a transcript of <em>Lasers &amp; Feeling</em> game session would look like based on the predictive patterns generated from its training data.</p>

That&#8217;s the perspective of Andi Grabner, who recently transitioned from DevOps Activist to Platform Engineering Advocate at Dynatrace. &#8220;The idea of DevOps is transforming.

<blockquote>
<p>The choice of where and how to start your AI journey is a business decision, not a technology one. By grounding your AI efforts in the operational muscle you’ve already built with Java and Spring, you minimize friction and risk. Everyone just keeps doing what they’re doing, but with a new tool. This established operational and development life is the hard-won experience, paid for in decades of maintenance and gut-wrenching production failures, that gives you the platform to continuously absorb new capabilities like Spring AI and MCP.</p>
<p>Get the developer experience and the operator experience right, and you unlock the organizational velocity needed to turn tentative AI experiments into a mission-critical competitive advantage.</p>
