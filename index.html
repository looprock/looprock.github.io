<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The new ad featuring Haaland was built using EA's Frostbite game engine to remix scenes of Haaland from the recent Beats ad <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuUXiJW2HjY">"The King &amp; The Viking"</a> featuring Haaland and NBA legend LeBron James.
<br/>
<br/>
Under the new partnership, users who play EA SPORTS FC 24 by November 1 will receive Founder status in the game with access to exclusive in-game rewards such as a permanent Erling Haaland item in Ultimate Team mode and custom digital Beats Studio Pro in a Haaland-inspired Viking theme.

According to the operator of <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&amp;logNo=223247397138&amp;navType=by">news aggregator account "yeux1122"</a> on the Naver blog, supply chain sources have "consistently" seen evidence that Apple has low-cost MacBooks in two different sizes in ongoing development.

<br/>
The account's sources suggest that while Apple has yet to fully commit to mass producing the low-cost Macs, they are now "more likely than ever" to make it to market because of a sharp fall in iPad and MacBook sales.
