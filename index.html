The tipster claimed to be familiar with an iPhone 17 Pro commercial that is allegedly being produced by a film company that has publicly listed Apple as one of its clients. <em>MacRumors</em> has not independently confirmed any of the information shared by the tipster, so skepticism is obviously warranted for now.

The tipster revealed three alleged iPhone 17 Pro features that have not been rumored previously:<ul><li>An upgraded Telephoto lens with up to <strong>8× optical zoom</strong>, compared to up to 5× optical zoom on the iPhone 16 Pro models. The lens can apparently move, allowing for continuous optical zoom at various focal lengths.</li></ul> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=ks775ehf">announced</a> an overhaul of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>'s age rating system across all of its platforms.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-833991" height="1266" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Desaturated.jpg" width="2250"/>
<br/>
The company has added three new age rating tiers — 13+, 16+, and 18+ — to the existing 4+ and 9+ classifications. At the same time, the 12+ and 17+ categories are being removed.
<br/>
<br/>
The new framework is designed to give parents more control and clarity over which apps are appropriate for their children and to better align ‌App Store‌ ratings with region-specific standards. As part of the rollout, Apple has reassigned age ratings for all existing apps and games based on the responses developers previously provided in the ‌App Store‌ Connect age rating questionnair [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            A quick addendum to the all-new AppleCare One plan that debuted this week: it is compatible with Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/iphone/iphone-upgrade-program">iPhone Upgrade Program</a> in the United States.

<br/>
iPhone Upgrade Program members receive AppleCare+ with Theft and Loss coverage as part of their monthly payment, but they can switch to AppleCare One if they prefer. It might be possible to save a bit of money by doing so.
