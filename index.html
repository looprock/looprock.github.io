            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>We reviewed the architecture of our global search at DoorDash in early 2022 and concluded that our rapid growth meant within three years we wouldn’t be able to scale the system efficiently, particularly as global search shifted from store-only to a hybrid item-and-store search experience. Our analysis identified Elasticsearch as our architecture’s primary bottleneck. Two  ...</p>

I’ve been hearing at workshops and at Ardan how people are experiencing Out Of Memory (OOM) problems with their PODs when setting K8s memory limits. I’m often told that when an OOM occurs, K8s will terminate and restart the POD.
I wanted to experience an OOM, but I was also curious about three other things.<br>
