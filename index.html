            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Last month, a seemingly unlikely rumor out of Asia claimed that Apple could be planning to launch a low-cost MacBook series next year in order to compete with Google's popular and more affordable Chromebook models. On Tuesday, that rumor was revived by respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

<br/>
A <em>DigiTimes</em> report in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/05/apple-low-cost-macbook-rival-chromebook/">September</a> said Apple could launch a more affordable MacBook line in late 2024 to differentiate it from the company's existing MacBook Air and Pro lines. Kuo now also <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1716885306933411885?s=20">believes</a> Apple could be considering such a move to boost ailing MacBook shipments, with a target of 8-10+ million units per year.

If Apple does release M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips at once, we can expect to see the new chips introduced in 13-inch, 14-inch, and 16-inch MacBook Pro models.

Kuo says that he previously predicted that Apple would not likely introduce new MacBook Pro models in 2023 because of "limited 4Q 23 shipments," and if new MacBook Pros do come out in November or December, the tight supply will last until the first quarter of 2024.
