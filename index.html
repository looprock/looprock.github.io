            This week we’re joined by Steve O’Grady, Principal Analyst & Co-founder at RedMonk. The topic today is the definition of open source, the constant pressure on the true definition of the term, and the seemingly small but vocal minority that aim to protect that definition. In Steve’s post Why Open Source Matters, he says “open source is at a crossroads” and there are some seeking to break the definition of open source to one that is more permissive to their desires, and they are closer than ever to achieving that goal. Today’s conversation goes deep on this subject.<br>

According to three individuals familiar with the matter talking to <em>CNBC</em>, the feature would have served as a rival to trading apps like Robinhood, allowing users to buy and sell stocks directly from their ‌iPhone‌ in a convenient way. One ability apparently pitched by executives was the ability to invest in Apple shares using spare cash.

            WhatsApp for iPad finally appears to be nearing a release. In the latest version of WhatsApp Beta for TestFlight, Meta has introduced an option to use WhatsApp on an iPad independently of an iPhone, thanks to an update to its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-whatsapp-account-multiple-phones/">Link a Device</a> feature.

<br/>
WhatsApp currently allows users of the encrypted messaging platform to link up to four devices to their account even when their main smartphone is not connected to the internet. Each linked device connects to WhatsApp independently, ensuring that personal messages, media, and calls are end-to-end encrypted. The feature also supports Macs, but not iPads – until now.

The positive side: if you&rsquo;re considering getting the consulting firms to bootstrap your annual planning, try a week with ChatGPT instead and see if it feels the same. Then don&rsquo;t hire them, as much? Also, the AI is good at hype-marketing.<!-- category:link --></p><br>
