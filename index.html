Demoing PCs with the new chipset, the San Diego manufacturer told <em><a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/qualcomm-is-ready-to-compete-with-m3-series-in-2024/">Digital Trends</a></em> that the Snapdragon X Elite records a multi-core Geekbench score of 15,300, whereas Apple's M3 obtains a score of 12,154.

            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> could feature an upgraded Ultra Wide camera with a 48-megapixel sensor, according to a Weibo leaker.

<br/>
The rumor comes from Weibo user "<a href="https://weibo.com/u/5143897135">Instant Digital</a>" and suggests that 2024's ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ models will be the first to feature more than one 48-megapixel sensor, leaving the Telephoto camera as the only rear-facing lens with a 12-megapixel resolution. The Ultra Wide camera's upgrade to a 48-megapixel sensor should allow it to capture more light, resulting in enhanced photos when shooting in 0.5× mode, especially in low-light environments.

            Apple has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=6e9odqgu">announced</a> an App Store pilot program called "contingent pricing" that lets app developers offer discounts to customers with multiple subscriptions.

Developers can offer contingent pricing to customers who already have subscriptions "from one developer or two different developers." For example, a developer could attract customers to a subscription by offering discounted pricing if they have an active subscription with another developer.

            Apple has agreed to <a href="http://petersfamilysharingplan.com">settle a class action lawsuit</a> over Family Sharing, and will pay out $25 million to put an end to the case. First filed in 2019, the lawsuit accused Apple of misrepresenting the way that subscriptions to third-party apps worked with the Family Sharing feature.

<br/>
While Family Sharing allows participants to share subscriptions with one another, app developers can opt out of allowing a single subscription to be shared among multiple people. Not all subscriptions can be shared because of the opt out policy, which is what led to the lawsuit.
<br/>
<br/>
Though Apple has agreed to a settlement, the company says it did nothing wrong and denies making misleading misrepresentations. Apple decided to avoid the potential cost and burden of a jury trial.
