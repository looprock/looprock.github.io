            <p>Imagine you have a fabulous idea to drive more sales on Etsy by giving out <em>free ice cream</em> with every purchase. How would you know if it will actually work?</p>
<p>One way to test this out is to run an <strong>experiment</strong>! An experiment is a learning tool that can help us see if a new change really affects user behavior and key metrics we care about. At Etsy, we run nearly 2000 experiments a year for testing new ideas to improve the user experience for our buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>For our ice cream idea, we could set up our experiment as an A/B test on the listing page, where one group of users (the “control” group) sees the usual “Buy it now” button, while the other (the "treatment" group) sees a shiny new version that says, “Buy it now and get a FREE ICE CREAM!”.</p>

            Buried within iOS 26 is a hidden history that lets you see every call you've ever exchanged with a specific contact, potentially going back years. You might not know it, but you can access this detailed call history on your iPhone in seconds.

Viewing the new extended history screen can come in handy when you need to recall when you last spoke with someone. It's also pretty useful when you want to verify a call duration for whatever reason. Here's how to get there.
