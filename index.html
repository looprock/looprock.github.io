The report said that Apple News publishers will receive a 70% cut of the revenue from ads sold by Apple within their articles, and added that publishers will continue to receive 100% of the revenue from in-article ads that they sell themselves.

            It's been two months since Apple released the Apple Watch Series 10, and <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera has been using the Series 10 alongside an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> to provide a longer term review and comparison.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The larger version of the Series 10 has the biggest display of any Apple Watch, including the Ultra 2, but it's only a little bit bigger than the Ultra 2 so you're not missing out on much if you have Apple's more rugged watch. The Series 10 is lighter and thinner, though, so it can be more comfortable.
<br/>
<br/>
In addition to having the largest display, the Series 10 has better visibility at an angle, so you can better see the time regardless of what you're doing. There's a 1Hz minimum refresh rate too so you get an always-on second hand with some watch faces.

            Google is working on a multi-year project to fully migrate Chrome OS to Android as part of an effort to better compete with Apple's iPad, according to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-os-becoming-android-3500661/">Android Authority</a></em> citing an internal source at the company.

The initiative would apparently see future Chromebook devices shipping with a desktop-optimized version of Android rather than Chrome OS, which would be a major shift in Google's operating system strategy.

Whether or not there&#8217;s enough sex trafficking to justify law enforcement expenditures is, at best, still an open question. And most sex trafficking operations tend to end with the arrest of the people they&#8217;re supposed to be saving: the sex workers. Then there are [&#8230;]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The United States Department of Justice wants Google to sell off its Chrome browser as part of an ongoing antitrust lawsuit, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-18/doj-will-push-google-to-sell-off-chrome-to-break-search-monopoly">Bloomberg</a></em>. Earlier this year, Google was found to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/google-search-antitrust-monopoly/">have a search monopoly</a>, and antitrust regulators have since been deciding on the actions that should be taken to address Google's anticompetitive practices.

The DoJ plans to ask the court to force Google to sell Chrome, which is the most popular web browser in the world by a wide margin. Chrome's integration with Google Search and other Google products has been cited as one of the factors limiting search competition.
