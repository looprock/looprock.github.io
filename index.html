            Apple intends to update its entire Mac lineup to the M4 processor over the next 12 months, which will make it the first time that Apple has used the same chip generation across all of its Macs.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-08-09 04:03:02-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18, Apple Maps has gained a new "Search here" button that makes it much easier to find what you're looking for in areas that aren't your current location or when you're exploring any new place on the map.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-961326" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/apple-maps-search-here-ios-18-2.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
In earlier versions of iOS, if you search nearby for, say, gas stations or restaurants in Apple Maps, and then drag the map to another location with your finger, it will usually (but not always) auto-populate the new area with search results for the same request.
<br/>
<br/>
That behavior hasn't changed in iOS 18, but what you now get in addition is a "Search here" button that gives you more manual fine-grained control of the area in which to search. This is especially useful if you adjust the zoom level of the map, or scroll away only slightly from the original search – two instances where auto-populat [...]<br>

            We’re excited to announce that multi-metric horizontal autoscaling is available for all services at Yelp. This allows us to scale services using multiple metrics, such as the number of in-flight requests and CPU utilization, rather than relying on a single metric. We expect this to provide us with better resilience and faster recovery during outages. This year, PaaSTA (Yelp’s platform-as-a-service, which we use to manage all of the applications running on our infrastructure) turns eleven years old! The first commit was on August 20th, 2013, and the first public commit was on October 22nd, 2015. That’s over half of Yelp’s...<br>

(It’s not.)</p> <p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="XbTqHu">The opinion in the Google search antitrust case, published Monday, is extremely long. Because this was a bench trial, Judge Amit Mehta was on the hook to make factual findings as well as legal findings. So, there are over a hundred pages of findings of fact and even more of conclusions of law, adding up to a 286-page document replete with footnotes, redactions, and even an illustrative graphic of a search result for “golf-shorts” (which, apparently, came up a lot at trial). </p>
