Here’s three talks from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2Me-TpMQFvCphDu_xm71ed_">the Platform Engineering Day</a> that I really liked. They’re primarily focused on what I’d call designing and product managing a platform. I’m a fan of the “platform as a product” notion - I came across it around 2016 or so at Pivotal and saw many organizations apply it. These three videos are in that general area: how do you build a good product that application developers will want to use and “get value” out of, not just deliver IT capabilities and services.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhloarnpxVo" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp"/><img height="374" src="https://cote.io/src" width="662"/><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>They’re worth watching all the wa</p> [...]<br>

That is, what do designers do on platform engineering teams. Some items: (1) Do at least one hour long user interview a week. This gives you an idea of what your users (developers) are doing, struggle with, how your improvements are helping or not, and give you data to decide what to do next. The last is especially useful for fending off The Boss and others who have suggestions that are not helpful: show them the data about what is, at least that you do things driven by analysis, not hunch. (2) Progressive disclosure - only show what people need for a given talk, not everything the tool can do. Can help with cognitive (over)load. (3) Errors are a good source for finding what’s wrong.<!-- category:link --></p><br>

            Meta, Microsoft, X, and Match today joined <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> to protest the way Apple complied with a court ruling requiring it to walk back its anti-steering rules.

"The Apple Plan comports with neither the letter nor the spirit of this Court's mandate," reads the brief.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-03-20 11:47:32-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The next-generation iPad Pro models will feature thinner bezels around the screen compared to previous models, according to a rumor shared today by a previously-accurate <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/O5VxfdQGB">leaker known as "Instant Digital"</a> on Chinese social media platform Weibo.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The leaker claimed that the next 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models will have 7.12mm and 7.08mm bezels, respectively, when excluding the metal edges of the devices. If these measurements are accurate, the bezels would be around 10% to 15% thinner than on previous iPad Pro models released between 2018 and 2022.

Other key new features rumored for the next iPad Pro models include Apple's latest M3 chip, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/upcoming-oled-ipad-pro-thinner/">thinner enclosure</a>, a &lt;a href="htt [...]<br>
