            <b>Published:</b> 2024-06-20 08:27:30-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Starting with iPadOS 18, which will be widely released later this year, iPad apps can offer custom drawing tools for the Apple Pencil.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956430" height="2160" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iPadOS-18-Custom-Drawing-Tool-Apple-Pencil.jpg" width="3840"/>
<br/>
For example, in a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10214/">WWDC 2024 coding video</a> last week, Apple demonstrated how an app could implement a tool that allows for cat paw prints and other animal-related symbols to be added to a drawing. The custom tools support features on the new Apple Pencil Pro, including the squeeze gesture and barrel roll action.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 and visionOS 2 also support custom drawing tools in apps, but the iPhone and Vision Pro do not support the Apple Pencil. As always, any drawing tool can also be controlled with your finger and other input methods.

Beats Solo Buds feature a more affordable $79.99 price in the U.S., up to 18 hours of battery life, and a compact USB-C carrying case.

            Apple is introducing a notable enhancement to its virtualization framework in macOS Sequoia by enabling Mac users to sign into iCloud within macOS virtual machines (VMs).
