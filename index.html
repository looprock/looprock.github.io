            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple appears to be internally testing an iOS 17.3.1 update for the iPhone, based on evidence of the software version in our website's analytics logs this week.

<br/>
Our logs have revealed the existence of several iOS 17 versions before Apple released them, ranging from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-preparing-ios-17-0-3/">iOS 17.0.3</a> to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/apple-preparing-ios-17-2-1/">iOS 17.2.1</a>, so there is a good chance that Apple will follow through with releasing iOS 17.3.1.

<br/>
iOS 17.3.1 should be a minor update that addresses software bugs and/or security vulnerabilities. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/13/apple-releases-ios-16-3-1/">iOS 16.3.1</a> was released on February 13 last year, and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022 [...]<br>

            The well-known repair website iFixit today shared a <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/90137/vision-pro-teardown-why-those-fake-eyes-look-so-weird">written teardown</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVJPAYwY8Us">video teardown of the Apple Vision Pro</a>, offering a look inside the mixed reality headset.

iFixit's disassembly of the Vision Pro reveals several internal components, including an array of cameras and sensors, fans, lens motors, and more. Unsurprisingly, it appears that opening and repairing the headset will be difficult.
<br/>
<br/>
"The EyeSight seems like a repair Achilles' heel—so many points of failure for a slightly creepy feature," said iFixit, in an email. "But we'll give Apple credit where it's due: the easily replaceable speakers and battery are big repairability wins."

Vision Pro is powered by an M2 chip with an 8-core CPU, a 10-core GPU, a 16-core Neural Engine, and 16GB of unified memory. &lt;a href=" [...]<br>
