            <b>Published:</b> 2025-11-04 11:39:23-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26.2, there's a new option to set an alarm to go off when creating a reminder in the Reminders app. When adding a reminder, selecting a time and then toggling on the "Urgent" option will cause an alarm to go off at the designated time.

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025665" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/ios-26-2-alarm-reminders.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
Alarms that you set in the Clock app can also be integrated into the Reminders app by allowing the app to access Alarms in the Settings app.
<br/>
<br/>
When a Reminder alarm activates, it displays a snooze option or a slide to stop option. If you snooze it, it will show a countdown on the Lock Screen that includes an option to complete the reminder or reschedule it. Tapping to complete the reminder opens up the Reminders app where you need to tap again.
<br/>

In the Reminders section of the Settings app, you can also opt to remove the snooze option and replace it wit [...]<br>

Live Translation allows you to understand someone who is speaking a different language than you. For example, if you speak English, and someone is speaking to you in French, Siri can tell you what they are saying in English through your AirPods.

The feature works best when both participants in a conversation are using Live Translation on AirPods. If you are talking with someone who [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Fox News has a problem: when you build your entire editorial model around feeding your audience&#8217;s biases, you stop asking whether the stories feeding those biases are actually true. Case in point: last week, they published—and then quietly rewrote—a story about SNAP recipients threatening to &#8220;ransack stores,&#8221; based entirely on AI-generated videos that never happened.

The new scores are as follows:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li><strong>Very Low</strong> - 0-40 (previously 0-29)</li>
<br/>
<li><strong>Low</strong> - 41-60 (previously 30-49)</li>

<br/>
<li><strong>Very High</strong> - 96-100 (previously 90-100)</li>

</ul>

            Apple today seeded the first betas of upcoming iOS 26.2 and iPadOS 26.2 updates to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming a day after Apple released iOS 26.1 and iPadOS 26.1.

We don't yet know what's included in the new beta software, but given that these updates will be tested over the holiday period, Apple may be planning to focus on bug fixes and performance improvements rather than adding notable new features.

When we learn what's new in the updates, we'll share details.

            Apple today provided developers with the first betas of upcoming watchOS 26.2, tvOS 26.2, and visionOS 26.2 betas for testing purposes. The software comes a day after Apple launched the 26.1 versions of each platform.

<br/>
The software updates are available through the Settings app on each device, and because these are developer betas, a free developer account is required.

We don't know what new features might be added in watchOS 26.2, visionOS 26.2, and tvOS 26.2. Apple doesn't typically provide release notes for betas, so we might not know what's new until the software updates see a public launch unless there are outward-facing changes.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>I theorize that in reality, AI generated video and images are much better<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> than we are currently experiencing. That’s because there are non-technological limits on them driven by prudence and prudishness. This several limits artistic and entertainment use.</p>
<ol>
<li>Most people are restricted to ten seconds or less and a limited number of generations a day.</li>
<li>Most services stop you from uploading pictures of other people. Being the cruder of the lot, Grok lets you.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <blockquote>
<p>Figure 1 shows a steady decline in interstate migration rates between 1996 and 2024 across all age groups. The figure also shows that moving rates are consistently higher for younger adults (25-34) than for older age groups and that mobility has declined within every age group. Thus, the overall decline in the mobility rate (age 25+) is due to a combination of population aging and mobility falling within every age group.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <blockquote>
<p>”Organizational interest comes in waves. When it’s reliability time, VPs are desperate to be doing something. They want to come up with plausible-sounding reliability projects that they can fund, because they need to go to their bosses and point at what they’re doing for reliability, but they don’t have the skillset to do it on their own.”</p>
<p>So if you want to get something technical done in a tech company, you ought to wait for the appropriate wave. It’s a good idea to prepare multiple technical programs of work, all along different lines. Strong engineers will do some of this kind of thing as an automatic process, simply by noticing things in the normal line of work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-to-influence-politics/">The piece</a> is very typical programmer cynicism about non-technical people in organizations: “management.” But, it is mostly accurate. Many programmers feel this way when they start looking outside of the dev team.</p>
