            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            At $99 in the U.S., the HomePod mini is a more affordable gift option for Apple enthusiasts. However, the speaker was released just over four years ago, so you may be wondering if it is still worth purchasing or if you should hold off.

<br/>
Below, we outline three things to take into consideration.
<br/>
<br/>

Back in February 2023, he said mass shipments of a new HomePod mini <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/03/homepod-mini-2-shipping-next-year/">would begin in the second half of 2024</a>. However, heading into the final month of the year, it is unclear if that production has actually started or if it will soon. There has been no talk about a HomePod mi [...]<br>

Apple's account offers an APY of 4.1% as of writing, and while that is a competitive rate, it is not the absolute best offer available at this time.
