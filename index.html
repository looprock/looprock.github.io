            <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman believes the iPhone 16 Pro will start at $999 in the U.S., meaning there would be no starting price increase over the iPhone 15 Pro.

Images of what purport to be replicas of an official redesigned version of the Milanese Loop have begun <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&amp;logNo=223575536903&amp;navType=by">circulating</a> on Asian social media platforms over the past week. The alleged new version of the band features a clasp instead of a magnet and seems to come in a 49mm size designed for the Apple Watch Ultra. The current Milanese Loop is only available in 41mm and 45mm sizes. A clasp like this would be a more secure solution for the Milanese Loop without compromising adjustability since the magnet used on the current version is liable to slipping, which loosens the band.
