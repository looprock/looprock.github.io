Apple filed the appeal on October 30, aiming to prevent an import ban from going into effect while an appeal was underway, but the ITC said no to the request. The ITC has ordered Apple to stop importing Apple Watch blood oxygen sensor equipment that infringes on patents owned by medical device company Masimo.

            When my children were little and I was trying to figure out how to be a parent, I read someplace that you need to have five positive interactions with your child for each negative one to maintain a good relationship. I don't know whether that is fact or myth; a quick Google search suggests that the origin of the idea was in a study about how married couples argue, the idea being that in a good marriage, positive things continue to happen even amidst disagreement. It's wise to be wary about applying a number discovered in a very specific context more generally, but there's a compelling idea here: positive interactions build us up, and negative ones break us down, regardless of whether we're talking about a spouse, a child, or, say, the PostgreSQL community. Too many negative interactions and we just feel like giving up.<span></span><a href="https://rhaas.blogspot.com/2023/12/praise-criticism-and-dialogue.html#more">Read more »</a><br>

In the U.S. and most other countries, the iOS 17.2.1 release notes only mention "important bug fixes," and do not provide any specific details.

It is not unusual that iOS 17.1.1 and iOS 17.1.2 are no longer being signed. Apple routinely stops signing older versions of iOS after new releases in order to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date and to prevent users from downgrading to older, less secure versions of the software.

            Alongside iOS 17.2.1, Apple today released iOS 16.7.4 and iPadOS 16.7.4 updates that fix an issue with built-in apps. In some cases, if a user deleted a built-in Apple app on a device running iOS or iPadOS 16.7.3 or earlier, the app would not be able to be reinstalled.

<br/>
From Apple's release notes for the update:<blockquote>This update fixes an issue where built-in Apple apps that may have been deleted may not reinstall.</blockquote>While we haven't heard many complaints about the issue, that is likely because the majority of users have transitioned over to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>.
