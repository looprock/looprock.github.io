            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today shared a new video in a new "Made on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>" series that features an adorable puppy that has a prosthesis. Chip was born with limb deformities, and he needed to have two of his legs amputated.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The prosthesis that Chip uses was created by 3DPets, a small business that designs pet prosthetics using the LiDAR Scanner and TrueDepth camera on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a>. 3DPets walks through the steps that it takes to create a 3D scan that is then used to create custom hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple's video shows Chip wearing his prosthesis to run, swim, and do other dog activities, plus it features other dogs with similar equipment. The video was shot on the ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌, and it is also part of Apple's Shot on ‌iPhone‌ series.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a>, </div> [...]<br>

Nowadays, many applications help us to edit our photos and images. With these applications, we can add some artistic effect or a filter that makes our image look with better color or maybe without color or look like an old photo, etc.</p>
<p>\
Apps such as Instagram offer editing options with many predefined filters and the option to create one by ourselves. This makes me wonder: “How do filters work on digital images? How are they created, or what do they do to the image?”.</p>
<p>\
I’m not going to address issues such as image processing with graphics or algorithms, but I would like to develop an application that allows us to add filters to an image.</p>

<em>This isn’t good enough. Do better. It’s not perfect, don’t release it. Why bother —</em> I hear as I sit down to write.</p>
<p>\
I have a nasty, judgemental voice in my head that comes online when I’m ‘failing.’ More often than not, the ‘failure’ is a mountain-high standard I set for myself that I didn’t fulfill. Getting 80% there isn’t good enough.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>\
PID controllers were invented at the beginning of the 20th century. Nevertheless, their mathematical description was obtained much later. Today, this mechanism finds various applications in different industries, from autopilots to industrial automation. When working with PID controllers, one of the most challenging tasks is to tune them properly. In this paper, we analyze the mathematical representations of PID controller gains used to tune the algorithm.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Proportional–integral–derivative controllers</strong>, or PID controllers, find many applications. They are used in controllers for BLDC motors, flight controllers, and power factor correction units. You can find dozens of them in electric vehicles. PID controllers are a part of temperature and humidity control systems used in the manufacturing, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries. PID controllers are used in power electronics (particularly in converters), industrial furnaces, and almost all automated processes in manufacturing.</p> [...]<br>

This approach is more streamlined and comprehensive, inheriting the absolute security of native bridges while avoiding the system complexity and trust costs associated with third-party bridges.<br>
