            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, Apple replaced the traditional mute switch with a new multi-function Action Button. The button can be assigned to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-15-pro-how-to-customize-action-button/">perform a number of tasks</a>, ranging from activating the flashlight to turning on the camera. Perhaps the most useful way to use the Action Button is with Shortcuts, because the single button can perform more than one action at once or bring up a selection of tools.

<br/>
The <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3453">Digital Markets, Competition, and Consumers Bill</a> (DMCC) that the UK is developing would allow competition authorities to impose conduct requirements on companies and "promote competition" when a company's policies are "having an adverse effect on competition."
