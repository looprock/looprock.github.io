            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today released an iTunes 12.13.2 update for Windows users, with the software introducing support for the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models.

<br/>
iTunes for Windows is typically updated every few months, and this update follows a December release that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/14/itunes-for-windows-12-13-1/">added security fixes</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
iTunes has been phased out on the Mac for several years now and it has been replaced with Finder and the TV app, but Apple has continued to keep the Windows version available.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The new iPad Pro and iPad Air models unveiled this week do not include Apple stickers in the box, as a result of Apple's commitment to removing all plastic from its product packaging, according to an Apple Store memo obtained <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/05/07/new-ipad-pro-ipad-air-apple-stickers/">by <em>9to5Mac</em></a>.

<br/>
If you really want a sticker, the report said you can still ask an employee for one while purchasing a new iPad Pro or iPad Air at an Apple Store.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple also does not include stickers with the Vision Pro headset, but the new MacBook Air models released in March do come with them, so it appears that Apple is still in the process of gradually phasing out Apple stickers in the box for its latest products.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-05-08 08:35:20-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            TikTok parent company ByteDance <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/court-filing-on-tiktok-ban-2024">today filed a lawsuit</a> against the U.S. government in an effort to put a stop to the bill requiring <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/tiktok-facing-us-ban-congress-passes-bill/">TikTok to be sold off</a> to a non-Chinese company in a matter of months, or face a U.S. ban.

<br/>
The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act that passed in April requires ByteDance to divest its TikTok ownership within nine months, with the possibility of a three-month extension if a deal is in progress. If TikTok is not sold off, the bill will prevent app stores and companies in the U.S. from providing the TikTok app to users. As of now, TikTok will be forced to shut down on January 19, 2025.

            Paul Orlando is back to talk about his book titled “Why Now?” You may remember Paul from his last appearance (a fan favorite) talking with Jerod about complex systems & second-order effects. Paul’s book, “Why Now?” explores the concept of timing and the importance of understanding the ‘why now’ in business and product development. We discuss timing examples from the book that were either too early or too late (such as the first video phone and car phones), the need to consider both technological advancements and user demand when assessing timing, the significance of timing in the success of companies like Apple and the launch of the iPhone, Uber and Heroku, and more.
