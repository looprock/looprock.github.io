In his <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1670619672096686080?s=20">latest Twitter post</a>, Kuo said upgrading the UWB processor, which Apple currently calls the U1 chip, is part of a plan to "aggressively upgrade hardware specifications to build a more competitive ecosystem for Vision Pro." Kuo goes on:

<blockquote>The ecosystem is one of the key success factors for Vision Pro, including the integration with other Apple hardware products, and related main hardware specifications are Wi-Fi and UWB.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            You need to add as many credible sources as possible so readers can trust your words and verify them if they are skeptical. When an editor notices you have quotes in your story and statistics to which you haven’t given us your source, we will reject and ask you to add sources.

Statistics

For example, writing “60% of writers are already using AI,” needs a source so we know where you got your data from and can verify it is true. 

Big Statements

Big claims without stats also need citation. 

For example, writing “SBF was caught fleeing to Dubai,” needs a source. 

Quotes

If you’re quoting someone, you need to give the reader a source of where you got that quote.

For example: Zuckerberg stated “Privacy and safety need to be built into the Metaverse from day one.”<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            This should be common sense; taking thoughts, ideas, or words and presenting them as your own is wrong. 

Some prominent examples of abhorrent blogging behavior: 

Copy-pasting text into your story without attribution is plagiarism

Paraphrasing someone else’s words into your story without attribution is plagiarism

Copying someone’s story structure without attribution is plagiarism (and lazy)

Copying someone’s code with attribution is plagiarism

Nothing new to add here. Stealing is stealing, and it doesn’t matter what excuses you have. 

“Accidentally” copying someone’s text and forgetting to add your source  is still plagiarism. 

Writers have a duty to edit their stories and this is your responsibility. 

In universities, you’d be expelled for plagiarism. 

In the real world, you would be sued. 

At HackerNoon, you will be banned. 

Needless to say (but incredibly it’s come up in the past), if your story has been verified to have plagiarized other work, even ‘accidentally’, we will not accept that piece  [...]<br>

What we publish

We mainly cover: tech, programming, blockchain, business, startups, cybersecurity, AI, gaming, and writing.  

Honestly though, we are very, very lenient with this. Anything you find in our tags is something we published before and is normally fair game: https://hackernoon.com/tagged. 

This includes some things that might surprise you: #open-source, #biohacking, #freelancing, #fiction, #design  and more. 

Furthermore, we are overly strict about topics that tend to be spammy. Marketing and SEO, for example, is not something we publish too much of, because of all the spammers on the Internet. So when we do, we want it to be technical, with actionable advice, rather than general overviews with no technical knowledge or tips. 

Trending tech like Crypto and AI tend to bring snake oil salesmen who just want to spam a backlink in an article or promote a shilly NFT project. We are overly strict about these topics too becau [...]<br>

            Red flags refer to glaring issues in a story that are severe enough to reject the story outright without further review. Meaning until these things are fixed/addressed, we can’t publish it so it isn’t worth editing further.

<li>For Father’s Day, Kim set me up with a nice hotel room that has a sauna <em>in it</em>. I think we’re developing a tradition of these parents days where the parent gets the day off. Sort of ironic, but fitting for the contemporary pro mental health vibe we all stew in.</li>
<li>I was told to do no work, even my own projects. So I’ve been watching <em>Batman: The Long Halloween</em>. These Batman…cartoons?…have a guilty pleasure appeal that the live action ones don’t. They’re less…intense?…and more fun in that they go through a lot of characters.</li>
<li>I’m not a bit comic book reader <em>at all</em>. When I was kid, I read a lot of <em>GI Joe</em>, <em>Conan</em>, and <em>The Nam</em>. I would buy whatever <em>Sargent Slaughter</em> I could find at the used book store. I guess I did read a lot of comics, just not the super hero ones.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-06-17 15:27:23-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Starting with iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and macOS Sonoma, Safari automatically removes tracking parameters from URLs while in Private Browsing Mode, in order to prevent cross-website tracking. When a tracking parameter is detected while browsing or copying a link, Apple says Safari strips the identifying components of the URL, while leaving the rest intact. The links will still work as expected, but will no longer have unique identifiers.

Apple calls this new feature Advanced Tracking and Fingerprinting Protection, and it also works for links shared in the Messages and Mail apps. It can even be enabled for regular Safari browsing.

            Since its introduction in iOS 7, AirDrop has become the favored means for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users to instantly share photos, videos, documents, and more to nearby Apple devices with relative ease. Given its widespread popularity, the feature hasn't changed all that much over the years. But this year, Apple is stepping things up a gear by bringing several new capabilities to AirDrop that should make it more powerful than ever.

The following five features are coming with Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> software update, which is expected to arrive in the fall.
