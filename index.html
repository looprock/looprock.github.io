If your ‌iPad‌ model only supports one kind of ‌Apple Pencil‌, your buying decision is straightforward. Use the table below to find out which ‌Apple Pencil‌ models your ‌iPad‌ supports:

Monos offers the Metro Backpack in nylon and vegan leather finishes in a variety of colors. I chose the vegan leather option in a Saddle Tan color, which is regularly priced at $230 in the U.S., but has occasionally gone on sale for less.

<br/>
Overall, I find the backpack to both look and feel very premium, with quality materials complemented by nice stitching. Monos says the backpack uses entirely vegan materials, including felt made from recycled plastic bottles. The vegan leather is sai [...]<br>

Apple does not provide details on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware, so it is unclear what's new.

Postgres supports relational data, and it supports non-relational data like JSON.  This ability is often called <a class="txt2html" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-model_database" style="text-decoration: none;">multi-model.</a>
