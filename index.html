            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Since at least July 4, Apple Maps has failed to treat the privately-owned Highway 407 ETR in the Toronto, Canada area as a toll road, according to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/applemaps/comments/1ls22e2/avoid_tolls_setting_not_working/">complaints from affected users</a>. This issue is not limited to any particular device or software version, with users experiencing the problem across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and web.

<br/>
As a result of this issue, local Apple Maps users who have turned on the "Avoid Tolls" setting may still be routed onto the Highway 407 ETR when using turn-by-turn directions. This can prove to be a very costly mistake, as the highway is notoriously expensive, with rates of up to 85 cents (CAD) per kilometer traveled for passenger vehicles.
