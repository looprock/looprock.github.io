            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-14 07:29:40-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In case you missed it — this is the post for people who mainly only read headlines — Apple has announced that it will be releasing iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1 later today. Apple shared this information in a press release on its Newsroom website.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1014613" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/Generic-iOS-18.6.1-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
The software updates will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/blood-oxygen-monitoring-returning-to-apple-watch/">re-enable the Blood Oxygen feature</a> on Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Ultra 2 models sold in the United States.
<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear if iOS 18.6.1 will include anything else, such as bug fixes or security patches. Overall, it is likely to be a minor update. Apple is now focused on iOS 26, which is deep into beta testing ahead of a general release in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: </div> [...]<br>

            Apple is working on a refreshed version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a>, and it will have an updated processor that's based on the S-series chips inside the Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Series 10, and the upcoming Apple Watch Series 11.

<br/>
A reference to a ‌HomePod mini‌ equipped with a chip that uses T8310 microarchitecture was discovered in Apple code by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris. The device has a B525 codename, which likely corresponds to the next-generation ‌HomePod mini‌, since the current model's codename is B520.
<br/>
<br/>
The existing S9 and S10 chips in the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Series 10 have T8310 cores, and we're expecting the S11 in the Apple Watch Series 11 to use the same technology.

            Rumors suggest that Apple is working on an updated version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> that's slated for launch later this year. Information about the upcoming device that was found in Apple code indicates that it will be equipped with the A17 Pro chip.

<br/>
There have been multiple rumors about a new ‌Apple TV‌ coming in 2025 with a new A-series processor, but it hasn't been clear which chip Apple would use until now. 
<br/>
<br/>
The A17 Pro was designed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Pro models, but Apple still makes it for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-mini-7/">iPad mini 7</a>.

            Apple is still working on a next-generation version of the Studio Display, and <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris discovered signs of the new display in Apple code.

<br/>
The upcoming Studio Display 2 has a codename of J427, and references to J427 were tucked away in software code that Apple didn't mean to publish. Rumors suggest that the next-generation Studio Display will come out in early 2026, so it makes sense that Apple is testing it now.
<br/>

We don't know a lot about the next-generation Apple display, but it is possible it will use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-mini-led-studio-display/">mini-LED backlighting</a>.

Apple accidentally leaked some internal information about the upcoming chip, and it turns out it will have the same T8310 architecture as the S9 and S10 chips in the Series 9 and Series 10 Apple Watch models.

It's not unusual for Apple to use the same architecture across multiple versions of the S-series chips for the Apple Watch. The S6, S7, and S8 chips all had the same core technology.

iOS 26.4 is expected to be released in March or April next year, so the software update is still many months away. However, Apple develops both "Fall" and "Spring" versions of iOS each year, with work on both iOS 26.0 and iOS 26.4 underway.
