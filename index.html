            Skechers recently started selling a <a href="https://www.skechers.com/kids/collections-features/find-my-skechers/">line of kids shoes</a> that have a hidden compartment under the insole for inserting Apple's AirTag item tracker.

<br/>
The idea here is that parents can put an AirTag in the shoes, and then track the location of those shoes (and the child wearing them) in the Find My app, which is available across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and on the web at iCloud.com.
<br/>
<br/>
The shoes can provide parents with peace of mind by allowing them to keep track of their child's location in public. If a child gets lost in a busy shopping mall, for example, the parent could view their location in the Find My app. Or, a parent could double check that their child is where they are supposed to be at a certain time, such as s [...]<br>

<br/>
With iOS 18.2, Apple introduced a new Find My feature that lets you temporarily share the location of an AirTag-equipped item – such as a bag – with others, including participating airline staff, to help track it if it's lost or delayed.
<br/>
<br/>
Users running iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, or macOS Sequoia 15.2 and later can generate a "Share Item Location" link in the Find My app. Recipients can view the item's location on a live-updating web map.

            Microsoft has used a variety of tricks to convince people to keep using the defaults of Bing and Microsoft Edge in Windows over the years, including modifying Chrome download sites and using malware-like popups. Now, Opera is fed up of what it calls Microsoft’s “manipulative design tactics” and filed a competition complaint in Brazil today, alleging that Microsoft is [&#8230;]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is running a Summer Deal of the Day promotion in its Apple TV app, offering discounts on movie bundles through the Apple TV Store. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012347" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/apple-summer-deal-of-the-day.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
Today is the first day of the promotion, and Apple is selling The Hangover trilogy for $9.99. The movies are normally priced between $12.99 and $14.99 each.
<br/>
<br/>
The initial Deal of the Day is number 1 of 14, so Apple will presumably be offering a different discounted bundle every day for the next two weeks. The Summer Deal of the Day packages can be purchased from the Store section of the Apple TV app on any platform where the app is available.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple regularly offers discounted movie purchases and bundled deals that are more affordable than buying movies individually, but specific themed promotions are atypical.  <div class="linkback">Relate</div> [...]<br>

Boyle said that using iPhones provided "the ability to work in remote places, very quickly, and very lightly, leaving a light footprint."

"We wanted our landscape to look like it hadn't been touched for 28 years by any human, so it was very advantageous for that," he added.
