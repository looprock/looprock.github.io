A redesign that includes a second camera is said to be one way that Apple thinks it can address user complaints that the iPhone Air, while an impressive design feat, has led to too many hardware compromises, especially given the high price tag.

Apple priced it starting at $999, and that appears to have put off customers, leading to reports of  [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-11-11 01:23:37-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has teamed up with Japanese fashion house ISSEY MIYAKE to launch <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/11/introducing-iphone-pocket-a-beautiful-way-to-wear-and-carry-iphone/">iPhone Pocket</a>, a 3D-knitted limited edition accessory designed to carry an iPhone, AirPods, and other everyday items.

<br/>
The accessory is like a stretchy pocket, not unlike an iPod Sock, but elongated to form a strap made of a ribbed, elastic textile that fully encloses an iPhone yet allows you to glimpse the display through its open structure. ISSEY MIYAKE's design director Yoshiyuki Miyamae said it is inspired by the concept of "a piece of cloth," and described it as exploring "the joy of wearing iPhone in your own way." (For what it's worth, the brand's founder designed Steve Jobs' iconic black mock-turtleneck.)

In person, it's hard to mistake how much it looks like the Apple Vision Pro, but there are minimal design options for an XR headset that straps to your face.

The Galaxy XR is a whole lot cheaper than the Vision Pro at <a href="https://howl.link/d8iqqc63twjhs">$1,799</a>. It's not as premium as the Vision Pro because it's using more affordable materials like plastic, but that also means it's a lot lighter.
