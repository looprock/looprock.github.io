            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple may be getting closer to bringing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> to China, based on an ‌Apple Intelligence‌ feedback form that recently launched on <a href="https://appleintelligencefeedback.care.apple.com">the company's website</a>. The form requires a +86 telephone number for feedback to be submitted, which suggests that it is designed for Apple users located in China rather than those who simply speak Chinese.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Last year, developer Simon Støvring came out with a fun little holiday-themed Mac app <a href="https://festivitas.app">called Festivitas</a>. Festivitas adds colorful string lights to your Mac's dock and menu bar, and this year, it can do even more.

<br/>
Festivitas received a 2025 holiday update today, and now it supports gently falling snow for an even cozier feel. Snow interacts with the mouse cursor, parting around it, and if you have a second or third display, snow expands across all of your monitors. Lights and snow can now be set to start at a specific time with a new Shortcuts integration.

The company claims the OLED panels in its latest phones can reach up to 8,000 nits of peak brightness – a figure that, if independently verified, would make the Mate 80 series the brightest smartphones on the market.

Can Claude &ldquo;remember&rdquo; the lengthy sessions from last month? // Managing that memory has been a huge part of the toolchain for playing D&amp;D with Claude. It often gets the gender of characters wrong, as a simple example. Recently, just have access to previous chat sessions has been great and helpful. If you keep your sessions in one project, it&rsquo;s good at looking at the past chat sessions. We&rsquo;ll see if this claim of memory over longer sessions pans out. It probably will: Anthropic is a trustworthy company when it comes to product.</p>

<p>There is a lot that rings true about this suggestion. Consider the following intuitive, common sense ideas: if we let immigrants come here and work, they’ll take our jobs; we should levy taxes on imports to help protect our economy from foreign competition; crime can only be controlled by getting tough on criminals. These ideas may be true or false, but the point is that they all have populist appeal, and they all seem kind of obvious.</p>
