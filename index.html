<p>nine out of the top 10 AI labs use Google’s infrastructure. He also says that nearly all generative AI unicorns run on Google Cloud, that 60% of all GenAI startups worldwide have chosen Google as their cloud provider, and that the company has lined up $58 billion in new revenue commitments over the next two years, which represents more than double its current annual run rate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(1) Clearly, some comms work in action here, to, (2) get the message out there that Google is kind of a big deal. Unlike with Kubernetes, Google hasn&rsquo;t been able to (effortlessly?) translate it&rsquo;s brand-appeal to AI. Maybe that&rsquo;s because much of AI-frenzy is consumer-focused, not nerd-focused (as was the case with Kubernetes).</p>

<h2 id="copy_just_part_of_a_text_message">Copy Just Part of a Text Message</h2>
<br/>
In ‌iOS 26‌, you can copy just part of a text message, rather than having to copy the whole thing. It's useful if someone sends you a web link, an address, or something else where you only need to copy part of what you're sent.
<br/>
<br/>
To use the selective copy, long press on a text message and then tap on Select. From there, you can drag to choose exactly what you want to copy.
