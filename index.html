            Apple should unveil the iPhone 17 series in September, and there might be one bigger difference between the Pro and Pro Max models this year.

<br/>
As always, the Pro Max model will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/29/iphone-17-display-sizes/">larger than the Pro model</a>:<ul><li>iPhone 17 Pro: 6.3-inch display</li>
<br/>
<li>iPhone 17 Pro Max: 6.9-inch display</li></ul>Given the Pro Max is physically larger than the Pro, it has more internal space, allowing for a larger battery and longer battery life. Nothing new.
<br/>
<br/>
It has been rumored that the Pro Max model will go one step further this year, though.

In March, it was rumored that the iPhone 17 Pro Max will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/iphone-17-pro-max-thicker-larger-battery/">approximately 5% thicker than the </a> [...]<br>

If you have a compatible iPhone model with a LiDAR Scanner (see the list below), you can measure a person's height in Apple's built-in Measure app. This way, you can see how much your nieces and nephews have grown since you last saw them, or find out if your favorite uncle is as tall as he claims he is. This might sound silly (it totally is!), but many people have no idea that iPhones offer this neat little feature.
