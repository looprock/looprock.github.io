<br/>
The <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3453">Digital Markets, Competition, and Consumers Bill</a> (DMCC) that the UK is developing would allow competition authorities to impose conduct requirements on companies and "promote competition" when a company's policies are "having an adverse effect on competition."

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            All first-generation Apple Watch models released in 2015 were added to Apple's obsolete products list on September 30, according to an internal memo obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>.

The list of obsolete models includes the first-generation Apple Watch Edition with an 18-karat gold casing, which cost up to $17,000 in the U.S. when it was available.

As of October 1, customers who send a direct message to the <a href="https://twitter.com/applesupport">@AppleSupport account on X</a> receive an automated reply with links to the Get Support page on Apple's website, and to the Apple Support app for the iPhone and iPad.

            Valve this week released <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, the highly anticipated free upgrade for owners of <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>, but Mac owners were left in the lurch on launch day, with the upgrade breaking the game and seemingly no macOS version forthcoming.

<br/>
The title's release on Wednesday forced a 26GB update for everyone with <em>CS:GO</em>, including Mac users, but after installation those on macOS soon discovered that the update essentially makes the game unplayable because Steam subsequently attempts to launch an executable file for Windows. Some users have had to employ a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/730/discussions/0/3881596897258134490/">workaround</a> to reverse the change and access <em>CS:GO</em>, but it's less than ideal.
