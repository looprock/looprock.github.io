I’ll go over the different methods available (and their issues), starting with the “naive approach” and ending with the best approach.<br>

            I recently decided to take on a personal #buildinpublic challenge where I set out to build and launch a SaaS product in just 10 days. I’ve decided to create the easiest-to-use carousel maker for Instagram and LinkedIn. It’s all about making the design process simpler and more accessible for everyone, regardless of their technical abilities.<br>

WhatsApp calls Channels "a simple, reliable, and private way to receive important updates from people and organizations," and cites hobbies, sports teams, and updates from local authorities as examples.

The personal information of admins is kept hidden from followers, so things like phone number and photo profile aren't shown.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple in iOS 17 has revised several elements of its stock apps, including the Podcasts app. There are a few noteworthy changes to the functionality and design of the app with the update, as detailed below.

<br/>
The biggest change is a slick new design for the Now Playing screen, which allows the podcast's full show page art – or any episode chapter images – to take over the entire screen. 
<br/>
<br/>
The playback controls on the bottom half of the screen have also been rejigged. The play speed button has been moved from the bottom left corner of the screen and now sits next to the rewind button.

I positioned it as input and guidance into doing your own Kubernetes stuff. My theory on Kubernetes is that everyone wants to do it - “it’s the future” - but very few apps are running in production. Gartner estimates that ‘by 2027, 25 percent of all enterprise applications will run in containers, an increase from fewer than 10 percent in 2021.'" If I wet-finger-in-the-wind it, what I get from that is that right now, in 2023, thee’s something like 12%, at best 15% of apps running in Kubernetes. That’s enough to be very meaningful, but it also means that we have many years of trial and error, discover, and benefits ahead.
