<p>I think "community edition" has several problems.  First, it suggests that there is a non-community edition, i.e., an enterprise edition.  While some companies do produce modified enterprise-focused

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The legal dispute revolves around GitHub and OpenAI's Copilot, an AI system trained on public GitHub repositories. Plaintiffs claim copyright infringement and DMCA violations due to Copilot's verbatim reproduction of licensed code and inadequate attribution. The defendants assert fair use and challenge the application of DMCA. The case explores the complexities of machine learning, public data usage, and copyright law in the digital age.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The emergence of AI-driven programming tools like Codex and Copilot has revolutionized the way code is written and reused. Unlike human programmers, these systems lack the ability to understand legal concepts like copyright, attribution, and licensing. This excerpt explores how these AI models are trained on copyrighted data, their probabilistic approach to problem-solving, and the resulting challenges in upholding copyright laws and ethical programming practices. The deliberate choice to prioritize expedited releases over legality raises questions about the responsibility of developers in ensuring lawful output. The AI's statistical pattern recognition, while efficient, stands in stark contrast to human reasoning and decision-making. The excerpt emphasizes the need for a nuanced approach to copyright compliance in the realm of AI-generated content.<br>

<p id="WTjql3">A federal judge has blocked a Texas law that would require age verification and health warnings for pornographic websites, calling it unconstitutional and poorly defined.

Aimed at photography enthusiasts, Obscura has a wide range of features, but it is also simple enough that it can be used casually. The updated design puts the camera controls that you need most front and center so they're easily accessible, with additional tools packed into radial menus.

Exposure, focus, white balance, and other parameters can be dialed in using the control options, and haptic feedback makes it feel similar to using an actual camera. The new layout is meant to make it easy to reach controls  [...]<br>
