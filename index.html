            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In the months leading up to Apple announcing the AirPods Pro in October 2019, the company considered changing the name of the wireless headphones to AirPods Extreme, according to internal information obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>.

<br/>
The name AirPods Extreme was floated by at least one member of Apple's leadership team, but the company ultimately decided to move forward with AirPods Pro branding after many employees objected to the change, we have learned.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple has used "Extreme" branding in the past for its discontinued AirPort Extreme router and wireless card for Macs, first released in 2003.
<br/>
<br/>
In the end, the name AirPods Pro is more consistent with Apple's branding for several product lines. In addition to AirPods, Apple offers both regular and Pro versions of the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and there wi [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Google today announced the launch of a new "Help me Write" feature that is available for the Chrome browser on both Macs and Windows PCs. It is a tool that is able to help users start writing something, or refine something that's already been written.

<br/>
Help me Write uses the Gemini model that Google announced back in December. At the time, Google said that Gemini was its most capable and general model to date, created through large-scale collaborative efforts by teams across Google.
<br/>
<br/>
According to Google, the Help me Write feature can be used for everything from online reviews to support requests to product listings. The AI model is able to understand the context of the webpage that the user is on to provide suggestions for relevant content.
