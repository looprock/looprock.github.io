            <b>Published:</b> 2024-06-08 21:18:55-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 18 will extend Dark Mode to the iPhone's Home Screen app icons, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="light-dark-mode" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-791185" height="622" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/light-dark-mode.jpeg" width="1170"/>
<br/>
Introduced with iOS 13, Dark Mode already darkens some Home Screen elements, such as the dock and folders. iOS 18 will go further by automatically giving app icons a dark/black tint when Dark Mode when is turned on. The feature will initially be limited to built-in Apple apps, but perhaps there will be an API that allows third-party apps to support it.
<br/>
<br/>
We believe that the dark app icons paired with a dark wallpaper will give the Home Screen a full-blown Dark Mode appearance for the first time.

<br/>
This feature will give users the option to lock built-in iPhone apps like Mail, Messages, Notes, Phone, Photos, Safari, Settings, and more, providing an extra layer of privacy and security. Unlocking an app would require Face ID authentication, and it is likely that the feature will also work with Touch ID or an iPhone's passcode.
<br/>
<br/>
We have not confirmed if the feature will work with third-party apps from the App Store.
