            Apple is permanently closing its retail store <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/northbrook/">at the Northbrook Court shopping mall</a> in the Chicago area. The company confirmed the upcoming closure today in a statement, but it has yet to provide a closing date for the location.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Humane today informed customers that it is discontinuing its $700 Ai Pin at the end of February, with the device set to be taken offline less than a year after it launched in April 2024.

<br/>
The Ai Pin will work until 12:00 p.m. Pacific Time on February 28, which is just 10 days from now. At that point, Ai Pin features like calling, messaging, AI queries and responses, and cloud access will stop being available. Humane recommends that Ai Pin users sync their devices over Wi-Fi to download stored pictures, videos, and notes before February 28 because data will be deleted after that.
<br/>

<br/>
Most rumors have referred to the device as a new iPhone SE, since it will succeed the iPhone SE (3rd generation), but there is mounting evidence that the device will be named iPhone 16E instead of iPhone SE (4th generation).

            Over the years, Apple has switched from an aluminum frame to a stainless steel frame to a titanium frame for its highest-end iPhones. And now, it has been rumored that Apple will go back to using aluminum for three out of four iPhone 17 models.

<br/>
In an investor note with research firm GF Securities, obtained by <em>MacRumors</em> this week, Apple supply chain analyst Jeff Pu said the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will all be equipped with aluminum frames. Interestingly, though, he expects Apple's rumored iPhone 17 Air model to have a titanium frame.
<br/>
<br/>
This would be a notable change for the Pro models, as all of the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro models have titanium frames, resulting in the devices weighing less than iPhone 14 Pro models with heavier stainless steel frames.

Alongside the model update, xAI announced Deep Search, which the company describes as a "next generation search engine." The new feature is designed to analyze information from the internet and X (Twitter) to provide comp [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-18 04:17:33-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has stopped signing iOS 18.3, preventing iPhone owners who have upgraded to iOS 18.3.1 from downgrading to that version of iOS. Apple released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/10/apple-releases-ios-18-3-1-with-bug-fixes/">iOS 18.3.1</a> a week ago, two weeks after the company released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/apple-releases-ios-18-3/">iOS 18.3</a>.

<br/>
Apple often stops signing an older version of iOS, usually within a week or two after a new version is released. When an update is no longer signed, it can't be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side software verification check.

This policy encourages users to keep their operating systems up to date. By preventing customers from downgrading to older versions of iOS, Apple ensures that devices [...]<br>
