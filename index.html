<h2>iPhone 17 Models</h2>
<br/>
Last year, Apple chose soft, pastel-inspired finishes for its iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus models. They are available in ultramarine, teal, pink, white, and black. The yellow that the iPhone 15 comes in is notably missing, having been replaced by the darker blue hue of the ultramarine. Together, the iPhone 16 colors appear more saturated and vivid – pink and ultramarine especially show a bolder, more confident hue compared to the pastel washes of the iPhone 15.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today released the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes">latest version of Xcode 26</a>, introducing several new features that developers can take advantage of.

<br/>
ChatGPT in Xcode now supports GPT-5, so developers can choose to start new conversations with GPT-5 or GPT-4.1. GPT-5 is the new default option, with two models to select from. GPT-5 is optimized for quick, high-quality results that Apple says will work for most coding tasks.
<br/>
<br/>
For more difficult tasks, developers can select GPT-5 (Reasoning), which spends more time thinking before providing a response.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is working on a new version of the Powerbeats earbuds called the Powerbeats Fit, and the company shared a teaser video of the upcoming earbuds on its YouTube channel.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The Powerbeats Fit look similar to the Beats Fit Pro, featuring a small in-ear earbud with a silicone wingtip that secures them in the ear. "Fit for every move," reads the tagline of Apple's video.
<br/>
<br/>
The Powerbeats Fit could have some of the same features as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/powerbeats-pro/">Powerbeats Pro</a> 2, such as heart rate sensing and Active Noise Cancellation.
<br/>
<br/>
Little is known about the Powerbeats Fit right now, but Apple says they are coming in fall 2025. Fall 2025 technically begins on September 22, so we could see them sometime after Apple's September 9 iPhone-centric event.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/">Beats</a></div><br/>This article, " [...]<br>

<br/>
Apple's Crossbody Strap reportedly features an unusual magnetic design; it likely has a "flexible metal core" that makes it magnetic along its entire length. At the ends, "rings polarized oppositely to the strap close the system." The design eliminates the need for conventional hooks or loops.
<br/>
<br/>
Samples of the Crossbody Strap are apparently made from a woven nylon material similar to the Apple Watch's Sport Loop bands. Apple may also introduce a silicone variant.

            Our friends at Cult.Repo launched their epic Python documentary on August 28th, 2025! To celebrate, we sat down with Travis Oliphant –creator of NumPy, SciPy, and more– to get his perspective on how Python took over the software world.

Stick around for the twist ending! We set aside Python and dissect Travis' big idea to make open source projects financially sustainable through direct investment.<br>
