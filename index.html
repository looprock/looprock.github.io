            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple maintained its position as the global leader in the wireless headphone market in the first quarter of 2025, achieving 18.2 million shipments and capturing a 23.3% market share, according to new data from <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-tws-market-q1-2025">Canalys</a>.

<br/>
The data suggests that Apple, including its Beats subsidiary, continues to leverage its hardware-software ecosystem to dominate the true wireless stereo (TWS) market. Although its market share declined slightly from 24.4% in the first quarter of 2024, Apple still obtained a 12% year-over-year growth in shipments, contributing significantly to the global market's overall rebound. Total global TWS shipments rose to 78.3 million units—marking an 18% annual increase, which is the fastest growth rate for the category since 2021.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iOS 18.4, Apple added support for robot vacuums to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a>, and some of the companies that make robot vacuums have started offering products with Matter integration. Matter-compatible robot vacuums can be added to ‌HomeKit‌ and controlled via <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> voice commands and the Home app.

<br/>
Roborock is one of the companies that's adopting Matter, and the Roborock Saros 10R now works with ‌HomeKit‌. The Saros 10R is one of Roborock's flagship vacuums and it's relatively new, so like most of these Matter-enabled vacuum options, it does not come cheap. It's $1,600, but it does have Roborock's most advanced feature set.

            Nanoleaf, known for its range of iPhone-connected lighting products, today announced the launch of two new devices. The Nanoleaf Rope Light is a super flexible LED light strip that can be bent into almost any shape.

<br/>
It is more flexible than Nanoleaf's traditional light strips, and it has a silicone cover that diffuses the light so it does not need to be under or behind a TV, display, or other device. It can be crafted into a specific shape, manipulated into an abstract design, or used to outline furniture and decor.
<br/>
<br/>
Each $70 rope light is five meters long (16 feet), and it can display multiple colors at one time. Nanoleaf ships it with mounting clips so that it can be securely mounted to a wall in a myriad of designs. There are 420 total LEDs inside the light, and it is 300 lumens, so more of an ambient  [...]<br>
