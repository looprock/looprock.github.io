            <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/what-apple-didnt-reveal-about-the-vision-pro"><em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma</a> today reiterated several features that Apple apparently developed but did not announce for the Vision Pro at WWDC earlier this month, including various fitness and wellness apps, full-body tracking, and more.

<br/>
Ma said some of the features could remain in development, while others may have been abandoned. Apple is not releasing the Vision Pro until early 2024, and has yet to reveal complete details about the device, so there may be additional features that will be available at launch. Apple can also add features with visionOS software updates.

            The Ethereum protocol is used by a variety of different networks. Each of these networks is effectively its own Ethereum environment, with an underpinning infrastructure made up of machines that are linked together.

There are nodes, which are computers that are connected online, and clients which are software programs that operate on each node.

To keep the protocol’s single canonical state and, hence, its intrinsic security, the Ethereum clients operating on the nodes assist. We may safely and securely utilize the protocol while simultaneously contributing to the Ethereum ecosystem by running an Ethereum client on a node.<br>

            Unlike existing AI systems, Meta's so-called Image Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture, or I-JEPA, is designed to aid users based on what it already knows about the world. While existing models compare nearby pixels to aid in image creation, Meta's I-JEPA is already fed with an internal model of the outside world which it then uses to determine what it needs to produce. The result? A generative model that is less prone to producing people with too many, too few, or impossibly interconnected fingers.<br>
