            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            It was a clear, apple-green evening in May, and Four Winds Harbour was mirroring back the clouds of the golden west between its softly dark shores. The sea moaned eerily on the sand-bar, sorrowful even in spring, but a sly, jovial wind came piping down the red harbour road along which Miss Cornelia’s comfortable, matronly figure was making its way towards the village of Glen St. Mary. Miss Cornelia was rightfully Mrs. Marshall Elliott, and had been Mrs. Marshall Elliott for thirteen years, but even yet more people referred to her as Miss Cornelia than as Mrs. Elliott. The old name was dear to her old friends, only one of them contemptuously dropped it. Susan Baker, the gray and grim and faithful handmaiden of the Blythe family at Ingleside, never lost an opportunity of calling her “Mrs. Marshall Elliott,” with the most killing and pointed emphasis, as if to say “You wanted to be Mrs. and Mrs. you shall be with a vengeance as far as I am concerned.”<br>

            <p>\
To be honest, the TLDR for this entire post is, "It just works,” so I'd more than understand if you stop reading, but like most things in my life, I like to <em>see</em> it working to reassure myself of the fact. So with that out of the way, let's consider a simple example.</p>
<p>\</p>
<h2 id="firstattempt">First Attempt</h2>
<p>I began by defining a super simple Alpine application that just has a list of cats:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">document.addEventListener('alpine:init', () =&gt; {
  Alpine.data('app', () =&gt; ({
        cats:[
            {name:"Luna", age:11},

            {name:"Zelda", age:1},
            {name:"Grace", age:12},
            ]
  }))
});
</code></pre>
<p>\
In the HTML, I iterate over each cat and display it with a web component I'll define in a moment:</p>
<p>\</p>

            <p>Life at a startup can move fast. For founders, this creates both an opportunity and challenge to establish a workplace culture that captivates core company values but takes into consideration employees’ thoughts, values, beliefs, and the way they work.</p>
<p>\
In a remote-working environment, workplace culture can look different than in traditional colocated offices, where employees might share similar values, creativity, and personal experiences.</p>
<p>\
Traditionally, workplace culture is often defined by the reflection of personalities and passions team members share with one another. For in-office companies, this manifests itself into an ecosystem whereby employees can freely communicate, share in creative processes, and benefit from company-related perks.</p>

However, when it comes to remote-first startups, the opportunity to establish a company culture is often hindered by the lack of physical interactions such as office space, premium amenities, and open communication.</p>

            While year-over-year iPhone upgrades are not always significant, new features begin to stack up over multiple generations. For this reason, the iPhone 15 Pro will be a notable upgrade for those who still have a two-year-old iPhone 13 Pro.
