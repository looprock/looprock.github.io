            <b>Published:</b> 2024-03-27 08:13:27-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            TTC subway stations in Toronto recently added support for Apple Pay's Express Mode, allowing riders to simply hold their iPhone or Apple Watch near the reader at the turnstile to pay for their fare. With Express Mode, payment can be completed without waking or unlocking the device, or authenticating with Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode. Express Mode even works for up to five hours after an iPhone has run out of battery power.

<br/>
As noted by <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewe/status/1772056065296752816">Toronto resident Andrew Escobar</a>, it is still not possible to add a PRESTO card to the Apple Wallet app, so Express Mode is limited to credit and debit cards added to the Wallet app for now. Public documents related to recent TTC meetings suggest that the PRESTO card will gain Apple Wallet support later this year.

            Apple supplier BOE has taken the lead in becoming the OLED panel supplier for the fourth-generation iPhone SE, <em><a href="https://www.ithome.com/0/758/418.htm">IT Home</a></em> reports.

<br/>
Samsung Display, BOE, and Tianma have all been in discussions with Apple to supply the OLED panels, but today's report claims that Samung has withdrawn from negotiations due to pricing problems, despite having an existing iPhone 14 OLED inventory to draw from. 
<br/>
<br/>
Apple has reportedly been holding out for $25 per panel, but Samsung's final offer was $30, which is lower than the two Chinese manufacturers. That leaves BOE and Tianma as potential suppliers, however Tianma has not yet met Apple's stringent quality requirements, leaving BOE in pole position to win the majority of the orders, if not all of them.
