            In 2022, Apple updated the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> with a complete redesign and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip, followed by an all-new 15-inch version this year, so how do the two product lines compare to its latest MacBook Pro models with M3 chips?

<br/>
Despite now being similar in appearance, the ‌MacBook Air‌ and the MacBook Pro are very different machines, so should you consider purchasing the 13- or 15-inch ‌MacBook Air‌, which start at $1,099, to save money, or do you need one of the higher-end 14- or 16-inch MacBook Pro models, which cost at least $500 more? Our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these two popular Apple silicon machines is best for you.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WhatsApp has <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2023/11/08/security/whatsapp-calls-enhancing-security/">introduced</a> a new privacy feature that lets you hide your IP address from whoever you call over the encrypted communications platform.

<br/>
As it stands, one-to-one calls over WhatsApp are established as a direct peer-to-peer connection between users. While this ensures the best possible voice quality, it means the connected devices must reveal their IP addresses to each other. 
<br/>
<br/>
According to WhatsApp, the new privacy setting introduced today works differently by relaying all of your calls through WhatsApp's servers to obfuscate your location, rather than connecting you directly to the person you are calling. Meta engineers elaborated on the feature in a &lt;a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2023/11/08/security/w [...]<br>

            Google and European telecom groups have urged EU regulators to designate iMessage a "core" service that would force Apple to make the communications platform interoperable with competing chat services, reports the <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ec2ec699-a91c-4389-b1a9-ae06dca836d5">Financial Times</a></em>.

<br/>
In a letter sent to the European Commission, the EU's executive body, the signatories including Google and some of Europe's largest telecoms operators claimed that Apple's service meets the qualitative thresholds of the act, and should therefore be captured by the rules to "benefit European consumers and businesses."

            Following the unveiling of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-m3-macbook-pros/">new MacBook Pro models last week</a>, Apple surprised some with the introduction of a base 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 chip, which replaced the discontinued M2 13-inch MacBook Pro in Apple's Mac lineup.

<br/>
Starting at $1,599, the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro comes with 8GB of unified memory. That makes it $300 more expensive than the $1,299 starting price of the now-discontinued ‌M2‌ 13-inch MacBook Pro with 8GB. Users can opt for 16GB or 24GB at checkout, but these configuration options cost an extra $200 and $400 at purchase, respectively, and cannot be upgraded at a later date because of Apple's unified memory architecture.
