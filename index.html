            <b>Published:</b> 2024-07-29 12:11:45-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The iOS 18.1 beta that Apple provided to developers today introduces Apple Intelligence, and it includes the feature that allows users to record and transcribe phone calls.

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960199" height="3047" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-call-recording-1.jpg" width="5416"/>
<br/>
With the update, you can tap on the record button in the top left corner after placing a call. Everyone on the call is notified that the call is being recorded through an audible message. There is no confirmation dialogue, so if a person wanted to not be recorded, they would need to hang up.
<br/>
<br/>
Once the call is in progress, the audio is recorded and saved to the Notes app. Recorded phone calls can be opened from Notes, and you can re-listen to the call, view a full transcript, and get a summary from the transcript without having to re-listen to the entire thing.
