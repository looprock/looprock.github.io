            <b>Published:</b> 2025-05-07 16:23:39-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S25 lineup back in January, it teased a "one more thing" announcement, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge/">introduced a super thin Galaxy Edge smartphone</a> slated for release later in the year. The Galaxy Edge is now closer to launching, and Samsung is planning an official debut event <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/beyond-slim-discover-unprecedented-innovation-with-galaxy-s25-edge">on Monday, May 12</a> at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time (or May 13 at 9:00 a.m., for those in South Korea).
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Samsung showed off some limited pictures of the Galaxy Edge earlier this year, and it will be notably thinner than Samsung's current S25 lineup. It won't be as expensive as the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but it will have the same flagship features as the rest of the S25 lineup, suggesting it is a mid-tier device much like Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17</a> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Netflix <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/unveiling-our-innovative-new-tv-experience">today announced</a> the upcoming launch of a new Netflix TV experience that will be available in the Netflix app for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. Netflix has been testing a redesigned version of its TV app <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/netflix-tv-app-redesign/">since last year</a>, and the new look is a notable departure from the current design.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
There is a new home page that has a streamlined, modern design, and Netflix designed it to put content front and center. Shows are organized into different categories as they are now, but each section will feature a large main card that has information like release date and show or movie description. Navigating through each show will display the same information for other content in the section, without the need to click in to a show to get more details.

            It's been nearly two months since the M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> launched, so we thought we'd take another look at the machine now that it's been out long enough to do some serious testing with it.

<br/>
Introduced in March, the ‌MacBook Air‌ is equipped with Apple's latest and greatest M4 chip, so it's more than capable of handling day-to-day tasks from web browsing and watching videos to getting work done. It's even powerful enough for photo editing and some light video editing work.

All Macs have a minimum of 16GB RAM now, so the base M4 ‌MacBook Air‌ that starts at $999 is a really good deal for what you get. You can upgrade the RAM and the SSD, which may be worthwhile depending on what you want to do on your Mac.

For example, Doechii's single <em>Anxiety</em> blew up on TikTok, while Billy Preston's <em>Nothing From Nothing</em> gained popularity after being featured in the season finale of HBO's <em>The White Lotus</em>. These are the sort of songs that will appear in the Viral Charts.

            Google this week targeted the upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> in an ad for the Pixel 9 Pro, mocking Apple's design plans and suggesting that Apple often copies Android features.

<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The ‌iPhone 17‌ isn't released, of course, so Google's ad is based on rumors that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> is going to get a horizontal camera bar at the back, which is a Pixel-esque design. Dummy models and mockups of the ‌iPhone 17‌ depict a thick horizontal camera bar for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> models, and a slimmer, more Pixel-style camera bar for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>.
