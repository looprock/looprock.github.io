            Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed in an interview with <em>CBS Sunday Morning</em>'s John Dickerson that the company's Vision Pro headset remains on schedule for release in early 2024, and revealed that he's already using it on a regular basis.

<div class="center-wrap"></div>

When asked how he uses the upcoming headset, Cook said he watched "the entire third season of 'Ted Lasso' on the Vision Pro," and admitted there are "some things I have access to that other people don't have access to, so I'm doing that, but that I can't talk to you about."
<br/>
<br/>
Cook went on to say that the challenges Apple has faced creating the headset are "more complex" than making something like the iPhone, so it requires "more innovation, not only in the development but also in the manufacturing."

Prior to the launch of the latest ‌Apple TV‌ 4K, there were rumors that Apple would build ‌Find My‌ functionality into the ‌Siri‌ Remote. That didn't happen, but in its latest major software updates, Apple has introduced a new iPhone option that does essentially the same thing.

In early September, Apple quietly released new firmware for its second and third-generation Siri Remotes. With the new firmware, tvOS 17, and iOS 17, if a ‌Siri‌ Remote becomes lost, the ‌Apple TV‌ remote control available in the Control Center on an ‌iPhone‌ can be used to locate the missing remote.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-09-18 07:45:39+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            TLDR: Roblox, a popular virtual platform, is under scrutiny for its exploitation of child labor and questionable business practices. British YouTuber Quintin Smith's investigations revealed that Roblox targets players aged 9 to 15 to create "experiences" (games) on the platform. Roblox takes a hefty 75.5% commission from developers, operates a closed economic system, and discourages fund withdrawals. Despite these practices, it claims not to be profitable, yet went public with a valuation of $41 billion. CEO Dave Baszucki's net worth is estimated at $8.3 billion. Roblox's platform capitalism fosters predatory behaviors and even has an in-game virtual stock market for NFT-like "collectibles." It's positioned to monetize the emerging metaverse, potentially concentrating power and repeating dark chapters in labor history. The metaverse's impact on labor and ethics remains uncertain, as powerful corporations embrace this evolving technology.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            A design system comprises visual language, framework, and guidelines, offering components like color palettes, typography, and UI elements. It accelerates development but requires collaboration between designers and developers. Gradual implementation is recommended. In this context, a Swift-based iOS design system is discussed, starting with color and typography models. These models are integrated into the project via extensions and modifiers, creating a standardized button component. The ButtonKind enum defines button types, and the ButtonModifier customizes their appearance. The result is an easy-to-maintain, iOS-friendly design system using Swift and Pattern Factory for scalable, consistent UI development.<br>

However, he said demand for the iPhone 15 Pro is weaker than it was for the iPhone 14 Pro so far, which he believes could be the result of more customers choosing to buy the Pro Max model this year.

Apple has not commented on why the MagSafe accessories were removed from sale, but the move was not surprising given the company is transitioning away from Lightning. The big question is, will they ever return with USB-C ports?

            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> likely feels considerably lighter than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a>, not just due to the switch from stainless steel to titanium, but also a change to the device's moment of inertia, according to calculations by Dr. Drang's <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-facts-and-estimates/"><em>LeanCrew</em> blog</a>.

The ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ weighs 187g, a 9% reduction of the ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌'s 206g weight.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Google currently offers no official repair procedure for the Pixel Watch, meaning that broken devices simply become e-waste (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23874281/google-pixel-watch-cracks-no-repairs-warranty"><em>The Verge</em></a>).

<br/>
This information was recently confirmed by Google spokesperson Bridget Starkey to <em>The Verge</em>. Starkey stated, "At this moment, we don't have any repair option for the Google Pixel Watch. If your watch is damaged, you can contact the Google Pixel Watch Customer Support Team to check your replacement options." Google Support chats add that the company "doesn't have any repair centers or service centers" for the Pixel Watch.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup noticeably lacks a model with a display size below six inches, just two years after Apple extolled the virtues of a 5.4-inch device. So why did Apple eliminate the "mini" device that some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> customers had come to love?

<br/>
Apple debuted the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12 mini</a> in 2020 following years of calls from ‌iPhone‌ fans for the company to offer a small-screen device with the latest features. When Apple did so, it was assumed that the small form factor would persist for several years, but the device came to a seemingly premature end upon the release of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> li [...]<br>

In a new <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apple-iphone-15-pro-gaming-interview">interview</a>, Jeremy Sandmel, Apple's Senior Director of GPU Software, and Tim Millet, Apple's VP of Platform Architecture, discussed the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌'s more advanced gaming capabilities.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            During Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/everything-apple-announced-fall-2023-event/">"Wonderlust" event</a> earlier this week, Apple claimed that the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ camera system "pushes the limits of what you can capture with a smartphone." It was a reference to the device's support for "spatial computing video," but the mention was brief and lacking detail.

<br/>
For those who missed it, spatial video is Apple's name for what is essentially 3D video. The iPhone 15 Pro is able to record spatial videos natively by combining video captured by the sensors of the Main and Ultra Wide cameras, which results in something akin to stereoscopic video.
<br/>
<br/>
This 3D video can then be played back using Apple's "spatial computing" Vision Pro headset when it's released early next year, allowing users to r [...]<br>
