            <b>Published:</b> 2023-12-06 02:03:17-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's Korean suppliers have begun developing smartphone under-display cameras (UDC), paving the way for the first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> with a true "all-screen" appearance.

<br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=24568">The Elec</a></em>, LG Innotek has entered the preliminary development of the UDC, which sits under the display and does not result in a visible hole in the panel when the camera is not in use.
<br/>
<br/>
A UPC differs from a typical front camera module, since it delivers less light to the image sensor. This is because light loss occurs as it passes through the display area before it reaches the camera lens, which can result in a deterioration in image quality and brightness.

To compensate for this, LG Inn [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Adventure game "Stray," which is designed to let players take on the role of a daring orange cat, is available for download on the Mac as of today.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Though the game was first released in 2022, it has been limited to Windows machines and PlayStation consoles until today.
<br/>
<br/>
In this third-person adventure title, a stray cat's curiosity causes him to get stuck in a walled city filled with robots and mutant bacteria, and the aim in the game is to get back up to the surface using B-12, the cat's drone companion.
<br/>
<br/>
Stray asks players to solve puzzles, bypass obstacles, and complete quests while avoiding security bots and evil bacteria. The game is platform-based, so players will need to climb up various obstacles and interact with the environment to open up new pathways.
<br/>

Since the main character is a cat, players can sneak, sleep, meow at robots, and nuzzle up to NPCs. Stray is limited to Apple silicon Macs, and it uses Met [...]<br>

The first version of the ‌iPhone SE‌ came out in March 2016, which means it has been seven years since it launched.

<br/>
The ‌iPhone SE‌ was sold until September 2018, so it has been five years since it was last available for sale, making it eligible for Apple's vintage designation. Products are marked as vintage five years after the device was last sold by Apple, while products are marked as obsolete at the seven year point.

Vintage devices are not guaranteed to be eligible for repairs through Apple or Apple Authorized Service Providers, though Apple will offer repairs if the parts are available.
