            In traditional business models, retailers handle order-fulfillment processes from start to finish—including inventory management, owning or leasing warehouses, and managing supply chains. But many retailers aren’t set up to carry additional inventory.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has told Apple Watch accessory makers that they will have to switch to its fast-charging module, according to <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/08/07/apple-watch-accessory-makers-have-to-switch-to-newer-costlier-fast-charging-module"><em>AppleInsider</em></a>.

<br/>
Apple Watch fast charging was introduced with the Apple Watch Series 7 in 2021, enabling devices to charge rapidly from 0 percent to 80 percent in about 45 minutes. Apple apparently had shortages of the newer charging module at first, forcing some MFi accessory makers to use the older, slower technology. Going forward, Apple is focusing on production of fast-charging modules only.

Companies can continue to submit plans for accessories that include the original, non-fast-charging variant of the Apple Watch charger module (C162) until  [...]<br>
