            After a four-year absence, <em>Fortnite</em> is making its return to iPhones – but only for users in the European Union.

The return of <em>Fortnite</em> to iOS comes as a result of the EU's Digital Markets Act, which has forced Apple to allow third-party app marketplaces on its platform.

            Apple today stopped signing iOS 17.6, preventing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users from downgrading to that version of iOS.

Apple regularly stops signing older version of iOS, typically within a week or two after a new version is released. When Apple stops signing an update, it can no longer be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side software verification check, so those who have updated to the latest version of iOS cannot downgrade.
