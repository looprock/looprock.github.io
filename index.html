            <b>Published:</b> 2024-07-09 09:00:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Nomad today announced the launch of its latest product, the <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/ac-adapter-65w-usb-c-watch-edition">65W AC Power Adapter Apple Watch Edition</a>. Ideal for travel, the power adapter includes two USB-C ports and an Apple Watch charging puck.

<br/>
Like most modern chargers, Nomad's 65W Apple Watch Power Adapter uses Gallium Nitride (GaN) technology, so it's compact. It's a little thicker than Apple chargers, but it's much smaller than the comparable 61W charger from Apple and overall more portable. The prongs fold down when the charger is not in use, which increases portability.
<br/>
<br/>
The two USB-C ports offer up to 65W total power, so if only one is in use, you get the full 65W. If two are in use, the top port can charge a device at 45W and the bottom port can charge a device at 20W. Ther [...]<br>

The feature, which was previously only available on Google Maps for Android, helps users to stay within the speed limit while driving. Now, when a user begins navigation, the vehicle's speed is shown in miles or kilometers per hour, depending on the region. The icon changes color depending on the speed indicator to subtly encourage drivers to remain within the speed limit.

            Rich Communication Services (RCS) is a messaging standard Apple is adopting in iOS 18 that will revolutionize the messaging experience between iPhone and Android devices. Think of it as SMS 2.0 – a major upgrade to the traditional text messaging we've been using for years.

<h2>Key Features of RCS</h2>
<br/>
Apple's decision to embrace RCS came <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">last year</a> after persistent persuasion from Google, which has been championing RCS adoption worldwide – and with good reason.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is preparing to release a minor iOS 17.5.2 update for the iPhone, according to a post shared today by an anonymous leaker on X, formerly known as Twitter. The leaker has a private account, so we are not identifying it or linking to it, but they have proven to be a consistently accurate source for upcoming iOS updates.

<br/>
Nothing is known about iOS 17.5.2, beyond the leaker claiming that the update will have a build number of 21F101. However, the update will almost certainly be a minor one, especially given that Apple is now focused on iOS 18 beta testing. iPhone users still running iOS 17 can expect the update to include bug fixes and/or security patches.
