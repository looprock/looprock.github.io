            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, currently in beta, your iPhone gains a handy new charging feature that takes the guesswork out of knowing when your device will be fully powered up. Instead of waiting around or checking your battery percentage every few minutes, you can now see exactly how much time remains until your device reaches 100%.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-971681" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/iPhone-16-Battery-Life-Feature.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
A real-time estimate appears right in your Battery settings while your iPhone is plugged in, making it ideal for planning your day around charging cycles or working out if you have enough time for a quick top-up before heading out.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Check Remaining Charge Time</h2>
<br/>
The process is pretty straightforward once you know where to look:
<br/>

<br/>
<li><strong>Open Settings</strong> on your iPhone.</li>

            On its quarterly earnings calls, Apple provides informal financial guidance that helps set expectations for investors and Wall Street analysts. On its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/31/apple-3q-2025-earnings/">latest earnings call</a> yesterday, however, Apple mentioned something that it had not before.

Specifically, Apple's CFO Kevan Parekh said that the company's September quarter revenue outlook was contingent on Apple's revenue-sharing agreement with Google continuing. As noted <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/07/apple-accelerates-the-roadmap-and-ratchets-its-revenue/">by Jason Snell at <em>Six Colors</em></a>, this is seemingly the first time Apple has directly referred to the threat of losing this revenue within its prepared remarks.

The battery apparently has a metal cover, just <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/20/iphone-16-pro-teardown-video/">like the iPhone 16 Pro's battery</a>.

<br/>
The bus-powered Envoy Ultra is priced starting at $330, and it comes in 2TB or 4TB capacities. The SSD has a premium feel, with a black aluminum enclosure and an internal design meant to dissipate heat. It's not the most compact SSD, measuring in at 5.1 inches long, 3 inches wide, and 0.8 inches thick. It weighs 0.75 pounds, so while it tucks away easily in a bag, you're not going to want to haul it around in a pocket.
