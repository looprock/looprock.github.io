            <b>Published:</b> 2026-01-22 08:04:31-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Any iPhone, iPad, or Mac with a ProMotion display is capable of rendering buttery smooth 120Hz animations. However, Apple's Safari browser is locked to 60fps page rendering by default, making scrolling feel noticeably choppier for some users than in Chrome or Firefox. Thankfully, recent versions of Safari include a hidden setting that lets you unlock 120Hz rendering.

<br/>
At 60Hz, your screen refreshes every 16.7 milliseconds, meaning each frame of a scrolling page stays on screen for that duration. At 120Hz, the refresh interval drops to 8.3 milliseconds, so the image updates twice as often. This reduces the perceived blur and judder as content moves across the screen, making motion look more fluid and responsive.

            Apple has long been rumored to be planning a dramatic redesign for the iPhone's 20th anniversary in 2027, ever since <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/20th-anniversary-iphone-all-screen-design/">reported</a> last May that the company is aiming for an all-glass device "without any cutouts in the display." But new comments from respected display industry analyst Ross Young appear to throw cold water on these claims.

            As an Apple Music subscriber, you're able to download songs, playlists, and albums from the Apple Music catalog to your iPhone or iPad for offline listening, but this can gradually eat up your device's storage space over time.

<br/>
Fortunately the Music app includes a handy feature that can spring into action whenever your device's storage space runs low, and automatically offload songs you haven't played for a while in order to make space for newer ones. 
<br/>
<br/>
It's called Optimized Storage, and here's how you can enable it.

<br/>
<ol><li>Launch the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iPhone or iPad.</li>

            Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> will feature a significantly brighter display, according to a Chinese leaker.

In a new post on Weibo, the user known as "Instant Digital" said that Chinese supplier BOE has little hope of making panels for the ‌iPhone 18‌ because Apple's brightness requirements for the next-generation device are unprecedentedly high. This suggests that the ‌iPhone 18‌'s display will see a considerable leap forward in terms of brightness.

            <b>Published:</b> 2026-01-20 07:45:21+01:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>My findings after 3 years on AIs playing games is that they’re just generally bad at it. They’re just good enough to string you along, hoping they’ll get good.</p>
<p>Their lack of new ideas and inability to take action gives you a sort of “it’s just about to be good” feel that keeps you playing. Like that feeling that the next pull of the slot machine will be the jackpot.</p>
<p>Also, the memory required for ongoing RPG is vast, the AIs can’t take it.</p>
<p>AI’s can act like an advanced DM’s screen - a bunch of tools - but I’m starting to doubt that they’re any good at the role playing part of DM’ing.</p>
<p>I’ve been <a href="https://youtu.be/OV_ddU4BFvE?si=EK4V2e_8JMLH-AP3">optimistic for awhile</a>, and done a lot of work to get the AI good at playing D&amp;D. I need to think on all this more.</p>
