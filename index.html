            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> could start with 256GB of storage due to a $50 price increase across the lineup this year, a Weibo leaker has suggested.

<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/appleparkvisitorcenter/">says</a> the rooftop terrace will be receiving some unspecified "improvements," and it will be closed until Monday, September 1 as a result.

The notice was added to the Apple Park Visitor Center page within the past 24 hours.

When open, the rooftop terrace offers a partial view of Apple Park, and there are tables and chairs for sitting around. It can be reached via stairs or an elevator, and there is also a bathroom on that level. It is unclear what changes are planned.

            Apple is planning to launch a "Liquid Silicone" line of cases for iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro models, according to a hit-or-miss leaker known as "<a href="https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1953070043585040883">Majin Bu</a>."

In a <a href="https://majinbuofficial.com/iphone-17-here-are-the-new-liquid-silicone-cases/">blog post today</a>, the leaker shared images of the alleged cases, with some having a ripple effect on the back near the MagSafe charging area. The cases also have multiple cutouts for attaching a lanyard, which may be sold separately.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26 has a new Liquid Glass design. The leaker said the "Liquid Silicone" cases will have a "Liquid Glass effect" of some kind, but it is not entirely clear what that means.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Steam will stop supporting macOS 11 Big Sur on October 15, 2025, <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/659D-A19E-018A-81A6">according to Valve</a>, requiring Mac users to upgrade to macOS Monterey or later to continue accessing the gaming platform.

<br/>
The reason Steam will soon stop working on Big Sur is due to the client's reliance on an embedded version of Google Chrome, which no longer functions on older macOS versions. Future Steam updates will also require security features only available in macOS 12 and above.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple also discontinued security updates for Big Sur in 2023, and that's left legacy systems vulnerable to malware that could compromise Steam accounts and game performance. Valve is strongly recommending affected Mac users upgrade before the October deadline.

            Keeping track of missed calls can be challenging if you're juggling several tasks during the day. Thankfully, iOS 26 introduces a streamlined way to set callback reminders directly from the Phone app, making it less likely that you'll forget to return important calls.

When iOS 26 launches this fall (or if you're already on the beta), you'll be able to create callback reminders in the following way:

<li>Open the <strong>Phone</strong> app.</li>
<br/>
<li>Tap the <strong>Calls</strong> tab, then scroll down to <strong>Recents</strong>.</li>
<br/>
<li>Swipe left across a missed call, then tap the <strong>blue clock icon</strong>.</li>

"Signing" is a server-side verification check that Apple does when a new version of iOS is downloaded on an ‌iPhone‌. An update can't be downloaded and installed unless it passes the verification check, and the unsigning process prevents customers from installing outdated versions of iOS that are less secure.

            Apple has been updating some classic Mac icons during the macOS Tahoe beta, upsetting some longtime Mac users who prefer the original look. In beta 5, Apple changed the design of the built-in Mac storage icon, which you'll notice if you have it on your desktop.

<br/>
The existing icon still resembled a hard disk drive, but the new icon looks like a modern solid state drive. Apple's Macs stopped using hard disk drives starting more than a decade ago. The low-cost 21.5-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> was the last Mac that had a hard drive component, as it used Apple's SSD + HDD Fusion Drive.

            The latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> beta includes imagery that confirms Apple's work on a new version of the Apple Watch Ultra, which is set to come out this fall. <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris found an Apple Watch image with a resolution that does not correspond to any current Apple Watch models.

The image suggests that the upcoming Apple Watch Ultra 3 could have a slightly larger display size, with a display resolution of 422 x 514. The current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> has a 410 x 502 resolution.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-05 08:50:16-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, currently in beta, Apple offers a new Adaptive Power Mode that works alongside the existing Low Power Mode to intelligently extend your iPhone's battery life. Unlike Low Power Mode's heavy restrictions, this AI-powered feature makes subtle adjustments that you're barely meant to notice. Here's how it works.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-971681" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/iPhone-16-Battery-Life-Feature.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
<h2>What Adaptive Power Mode Does</h2>
<br/>
When your battery usage runs higher than usual, Adaptive Power Mode automatically makes small performance tweaks to help your iPhone last longer. Apple says this includes slightly dimming the display brightness or allowing some tasks to "take a little longer" to complete.
<br/>
<br/>
The feature works in the background without the limitations of Low Power Mode, although the latter may still be activated if your device depletes to a 20% charge level.
