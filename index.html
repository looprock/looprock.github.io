The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 17e is expected to be a minor upgrade over this year's 16e, launching in early 2026.

            Apple has <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/apple-security-bounty-evolved/">announced</a> a major overhaul of its bug bounty program that doubles the top reward to $2 million for exploit chains that can match the sophistication of mercenary spyware attacks.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Chinese smartphone maker Vivo has taken some inspiration from Apple's Liquid Glass design language for its latest operating system update, OriginOS 6. Unveiled this week, OriginOS 6 has the same rounded buttons and translucent glass look as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
In a demo video, a Vivo smartphone features an interface that could be easily mistaken for ‌iOS 26‌. There's a Liquid Glass clock, Control Center, squircle icons, glass-like rounded buttons, translucent app folders and dock, translucent notifications, and even wallpapers that shift with a 2D to 3D effect like Apple's Spatial Scenes.
<br/>
<br/>
There is no mistaking the Liquid Glass design influence even though Vivo references water when describing the operating system. "With OriginOS 6, every swipe, scroll, and tap flows like never before. No lags. No stutters. Just effortless motion built for the way you move," reads  [...]<br>

<br/>
The PowerGrip includes a 9,300 mAh battery that can provide a full charge to Apple's iPhones. Included magnets allow it to attach to the back of a MagSafe-compatible <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
It can charge at 7.5W wirelessly, but plugging an ‌iPhone‌ in with the included retractable USB-C cable speeds up charging. With the wireless charging capabilities, the included cable, and an extra USB-C port, up to three devices can be charged at one time. The charger is limited to 15W total, so it's best used to charge an ‌iPhone‌ and smaller devices like an Apple Watch or AirPods.
