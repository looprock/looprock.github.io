            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Nearly three months have passed by since Apple last released new devices, but the AirTag could be receiving an update fairly soon, according to rumors.

<br/>
Last year, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman reported that a new AirTag would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/24/airtag-2-mid-2025-rumor/">released around the middle of 2025</a>.

If these timeframes remain accurate, an AirTag 2 could launch within the next month. If so, perhaps the AirTag 2 will be announced during the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/apple-announces-wwdc-2025-schedule/">WWDC 2025 keynote on Monday, June 9</a>.

In a <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/opus/1070156196370972711">post today</a> on the Chinese social media platform BiliBili, a user who we are not familiar with said that they found code references to unreleased 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with the M3 Ultra chip, in an internal build of iOS 18 running on an iPhone 16 engineering prototype. Specifically, they said that they found J514d and J516d codenames in a file located in the /AppleInternal/Diags/Tests/ folder.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today shared several new short video ads on its UK YouTube channel, highlighting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> features like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, Ceramic Shield, Stolen Device Protection, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Each ad is about 13 seconds in length, and they are all text-based, providing little tidbits of information about the ‌iPhone‌'s capabilities. For the ‌Find My‌ ad, for example, Apple focuses on parents and children. "‌Find My‌ on ‌iPhone‌ lets you view your kid's location if you need to," it reads.
<br/>
<br/>
The Stolen Device Protection video reminds people that additional ‌iPhone‌ security is available. "Stolen Device Protection adds extra layers of security for your Apple Account if your ‌iPhone‌ is lost or taken."

            On iPhone and iPad, Apple's screen recording feature records a video of what you're doing on your screen, which is great if you want to capture gameplay, walk someone through a tutorial in an app, demonstrate a bug, or anything else. You can also include a voiceover in screen recordings. Keep reading to learn how.

If you're making a screen recording to demonstrate something in iOS, chances are it would benefit from some voiceover commentary. Fortunately, Apple enables you to do this by activating your device's microphone for the duration of the recording.
