<h2>Battery Life</h2>
<br/>
Apple says the Vision Pro provides up to two hours of battery life overall, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-vision-pro-battery-life-video-playback/">up to 2.5 hours for 2D video playback</a> specifically. In his review, however, Brian Tong said he achieved nearly 2.5 hours of battery life for general usage, and separately was able to watch the three-hour movie <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> on a single charge.

            Apple today stopped signing the iOS 17.2.1 update, preventing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users from downgrading to that version of iOS going forward. iOS 17.2.1 is no longer being signed following the January 22 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/22/apple-releases-ios-17-3/">release of iOS 17.3</a>, which introduced Stolen Device Protection for the ‌iPhone‌ <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-3-features/">and other changes</a>.

<br/>
It is not unusual that iOS 17.2.1 is no longer being signed. Apple routinely stops signing older versions of iOS after new releases in order to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date and to prevent users from downgrading to older, less secure versions of the ‌iPhone‌ operating system.

            Apple today introduced a new firmware update for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>. The new firmware is 6A324, up from the 6A300 firmware <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-releases-new-airpods-firmware-2/">released in September</a>.

<br/>
Apple does not provide details on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware, so it is unclear what's new. The <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/106340">limited release notes</a> for the update list only "bug fixes and other improvements."

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-01-29 11:34:00-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 17.4 introduces a small but useful change for the Clock app's Stopwatch function, adding the timer to Apple's Live Activities feature. When activated through the Clock app, the Stopwatch will now show up both in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> and on the Lock Screen.

<br/>
The ‌Dynamic Island‌ shows a small to-the-second timer, and the Lock Screen shows the full Stopwatch timer when the screen is being looked at. Pressing into the ‌Dynamic Island‌ shows options for pausing the Stopwatch or starting a new lap, with these controls also on the Lock Screen. After the Stopwatch is paused, swiping on it from the Lock Screen or tapping on the "X" in ‌Dynamic Island‌ will clear it.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Code discovered by <i>MacRumors</i> in the first beta of tvOS 17.4 suggests that Apple's work on "homeOS" is continuing behind the scenes. 
<br/>

<br/>
Back in June 2021, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/03/apple-refers-to-homeos-job-listings/">listed two job postings</a> that mentioned homeOS, but deleted the term when it was noticed by the media. We've seen no sign of homeOS since, except for in the first tvOS 17.4 beta.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple's 2018 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> ran a modified version of iOS 11 when it launched, but Apple transitioned to using the tvOS platform for the ‌HomePod‌ with the release of ‌HomePod‌ Software 13.4.

On Mac, some tracks are providing an error message about the song being unavailable, and the ‌Apple Music‌ app is continually skipping through playlists trying to find a functional song.
