<p id="WAuNrK">For years, Chrome’s Safe Browsing feature has automatically added potentially unsafe URLs to a list Google stores on your device.

The Standard protection for Chrome previously used a list that is stored on device and updated every 30 to 60 minutes, but now websites will be checked against Google's server-side list of known bad sites in real time.

            Apple's first-generation Vision Pro headset is an "over-engineered devkit" that ships with more sensors than is necessary to deliver Apple's intended experience. That's according to Hugo Barra, former VP of Android and head of Meta's phased-out Oculus headset brand.

Keeping a fresh, consistent UI on all these clients is a major challenge. Server-driven UI (SDUI) has become a standard industry technique for managing UI on multiple platforms. At Yelp, many product teams created SDUI frameworks for their features. Though successful, these frameworks were expensive to develop and maintain, and no single SDUI framework supported all our clients.

            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> is once again after Apple, this time accusing the Cupertino company of violating a court ruling that requires Apple to allow developers to offer in-app links to direct customers to third-party purchase options on the web.

<br/>
Apple tweaked its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/us-app-store-alternative-purchase-option/">U.S. App Store policies</a> back in January, and developers are permitted to put one link in their apps that leads to a website where customers can make a purchase without using the in-app purchase system. Apple is still charging commission for these purchases, requiring developers to pay between 12 and 27 percent (three percent lower than the 15/30 standard fee).

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The U.S. House of Representatives today approved legislation that would force TikTok owner ByteDance to sell the social media network or face a ban in the United States. The Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act will now go to the Senate, where its fate is unclear.

<br/>
U.S. lawmakers want TikTok to be sold to a company outside of China due to concerns that the Chinese government could force ByteDance to hand over data from users located in the United States. If China made the request, ByteDance would not be able to refuse. There have also been suggestions that China could use TikTok to spread political propaganda.
<br/>
<br/>
ByteDance has attempted to alleviate these fears by storing data from U.S. users on servers owned by Oracle, but the White House and lawmakers do not believe that is enough.

            What is Engineering Effectiveness Metrics (EE Metrics)? EE Metrics was envisioned as a hub that helps teams manage their technical debt. EE Metrics provides every team with a detailed web page that contains information about technical debt that needs to be addressed. It also serves as a platform to highlight top engineering initiatives at the organization level. EE Metrics empowers infrastructure teams to surface important migrations or metrics that could improve the health of software projects. Organization-wide migrations of technologies can often be difficult to surface and keep track of. General EE Metrics lifecycle Figure 1: Diagram showing how EE...<br>
