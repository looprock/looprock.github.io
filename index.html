            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) at the cluster level has been supported by the Oracle database for many years and has become a requirement of many security specifications and best practices. 
The Oracle <a class="txt2html" href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/12.2/asoag/introduction-to-transparent-data-encryption.html#GUID-769EC29B-0107-40FE-9A9D-BF81A4BBD0E9" style="text-decoration: none;">documentation</a> lists two
practical advantages of the feature:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Encrypted storage which protects data in case of storage media theft
  </li><li>Regulatory compliance
</li></ul>
<p>Interestingly, it does not mention increased protection from data being accessed by database users, database superusers, or operating system users, and that is because it has limited value in protecting
such access.  It does also automatically encrypt file system backups, and provides encrypted storage in environments where the installation of operating system-level encryption is impossible.

Citing industry sources, <em>‌DigiTimes‌</em> highlighted that unlike the 12.9-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, the 12.9-inch ‌iPad Air‌ will not feature a mini-LED display.

            All four iPhone 16 models will be equipped with A18-branded chips, according to Jeff Pu, an analyst who covers Apple and its supply chain. He <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-16-lineup-a18-a18-pro-chips-analyst-says/">first shared this prediction last month</a>, and he touched on the topic again in a research note this week with Hong Kong-based investment firm Haitong International Securities.

<br/>
In his latest note, Pu said "we expect all iPhone 16 models to feature A18," and he expects the chips to be manufactured with chipmaker TSMC's second-generation 3nm process "N3E." Pu referred to the A17 Pro chip in the iPhone 15 Pro models, based on TSMC's first-generation 3nm process "N3B," as a "transition design."

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple plans to start implementing generative AI technology on the iPhone and iPad in late 2024 at the earliest, according to Jeff Pu, an analyst who covers Apple's supply chain for Hong Kong-based investment firm Haitong International Securities.

<br/>
In a research note on Wednesday, Pu said his supply chain checks suggest that Apple is likely to build a few hundred AI servers in 2023, and significantly more next year. He believes Apple will offer a combination of cloud-based AI and so-called "edge AI," which involves more on-device data processing. He added that patience will be required with Apple's rollout of generative AI, as the company considers how to use and process personal data in a way that aligns with its commitment to customer privacy.

<br/>
In the United States, the price of the Basic plan will increase from $9.99 to $11.99 per month, while the price of the Premium plan will increase from $19.99 to $22.99 per month. The ad-supported tier price will remain the same at $6.99 per month, as will the $15.49/month Standard plan.

            ShotSpotter may consider itself to be a solid contributor to the fight against crime, but the facts don&#8217;t really bear that out. What it is capable of doing is sending cops to any place a gunshot is (possibly) detected, but that hasn&#8217;t really shown to have any meaningful impact on solving gun-related crimes, much less [&#8230;]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is investigating an issue where the display brightness briefly flickers or "pulses" on some Apple Watch models when Always On mode is enabled, according to an internal service memo shared with Apple Authorized Service Providers today.

The memo does not indicate which Apple Watch models are affected, but the issue appears to be most prevalent on the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 models released last month. There are complaints from customers about this issue across the <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-9-flickering-when-raising-to-wake-on-10-0-2.2407076/">MacRumors Forums</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/16y6ssa/apple_watch_ultra_2_screen_flickering/">Reddit</a>, and the <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255165682">Ap</a> [...]<br>

<br/>
Not A Bot is being tested in New Zealand and the Phillipines at the current time, and it only applies to new users. The X support account says that existing users are not affected "within this test."
<br/>
<br/>
Charging users $1 per year is meant to "reduce spam, manipulation of [the X] platform, and bot activity." X claims that subscription options have "proven to be the main solution that works at scale" to combat these issues.<blockquote>This new program aims to defend against bots and spammers who attempt to manipulate the platform and disrupt the experience of oth</blockquote> [...]<br>
