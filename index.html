            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WhatsApp is making it easier to catch up on conversations you've missed with a new AI-powered feature that summarizes unread messages. The Meta-owned messaging app now lets users tap on unread message counts to "Summarize privately" and get quick, bulleted summaries generated by Meta AI instead of scrolling through every individual message.

The feature uses Meta's "Private Processing" technology, which the company <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/catch-up-on-conversations-with-private-message-summaries">claims</a> keeps your messages and summaries completely private – even Meta and WhatsApp staff can't see them.

In a previous report, industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said he expects the foldable iPhone (or "iPhone Fold" for short) to include a <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f">dual-lens rear camera</a>, but Kuo provided no other specifics.
