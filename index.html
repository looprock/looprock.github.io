<br/>
At WWDC in June 2024, Apple previewed two of Siri's most anticipated Apple Intelligence upgrades – personal context and onscreen awareness. The features were supposed to arrive as part of iOS 18 and were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/apple-intelligence-siri-lawsuit/">promoted</a> the same year when launching the iPhone 16 models, but Apple is still working on them.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Netflix has dropped out of the takeover battle for Warner Bros. Discovery, putting Paramount Skydance on course to win the whole WBD business.

<br/>
The world's largest streaming service had been pegged to land a deal in which it would acquire Warner Bros., HBO, and HBO Max in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $72 billion in equity and $82.7 billion, including debt. But after Paramount submitted a final offer, valuing WBD at $111bn including debt, Netflix declined to match it.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            After several weeks of testing, Apple today released Xcode 26.3, an update that allows developers to use tools like Anthropic's Claude Agent and OpenAI's Codex for app creation directly in Xcode.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
With support for agentic coding, Xcode can complete more complex app development tasks autonomously. Apple worked with Anthropic and OpenAI to configure their agents for use in Xcode and to ensure that AI models can access a full range of Xcode features.
<br/>
<br/>
Agents are able to create new files, examine code structure of a project, build a project directly and run tests, take image snapshots to check their work, and access Apple's full, up-to-date developer documentation.
<br/>
<br/>
Along with OpenAI and Anthropic models, Xcode 26.3 is compatible with any agent or tool that uses the open standard Model Context Protocol.

In a new post, the Weibo leaker known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fixed-focus-digital/">Fixed Focus Digital</a>" said Apple's scheduled announcements for next week focus on refreshed devices with basic generational chip upgrades, rather than more fundamental redesigns.

            <b>Published:</b> 2026-02-26 03:48:55-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has agreed to pay Samsung twice as much for the LPDDR5X memory chips that it needs for ongoing iPhone 17 production, claims a report from Korean outlet <em><a href="https://dealsite.co.kr/articles/157475">Dealsite</a></em>.

<br/>
According to the report's sources, Apple recently held emergency meetings with Samsung's semiconductor division to negotiate delivery volumes of RAM for the first half of this year. The 12GB LPDDR5X modules used in the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro have already roughly doubled in price since early 2025, rising from around $30 to approximately $70.
<br/>
<br/>
Samsung is said to have originally planned to push for a 60% price increase on LPDDR5X modules supplied to Apple. Instead, however, Samsung opened with a 100% markup as a negotiating tactic – and Apple apparently accepted it on the spot.
