            Apple released the second beta of iOS 26.1 and iPadOS 26.1, introducing useful changes to alarms, multitasking on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and more.

<h2>Alarms and Timers</h2>

Alarms set using the Clock app now have a slide to stop button rather than a tap to stop button on the Lock Screen. To snooze an alarm, you can tap, but to turn it off from the Lock Screen, you need to use a slide gesture.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the second beta of iOS 26.1, Apple updated the design of alarms set on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, making them harder to dismiss than before.

<br/>
Stopping an alarm in iOS 26.1 beta 2 requires a new Slide to Stop gesture rather than a simple tap. You can continue to tap to snooze an alarm, but if you want to turn it off entirely, you need to use a swipe.
<br/>
<br/>
Transitioning from a tap to a slide gesture to stop an alarm could potentially help people who sleepily dismiss an alarm without meaning to. It's easy to accidentally tap Stop instead of Snooze in the current version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, but now if you blindly tap at your ‌iPhone‌ in the morning, you won't be able to disable your alarm entirely.

The updated version of Slide Over works with all of the new ‌iPadOS 26‌ multitasking features. You can have multiple app windows open, and then use Slide Over to quickly get to an app that overlays your windowed apps.

To use Slide Over in iPadOS 26.1, you'll need to tap on the green icon of an app's window to open up the window sizing controls. From there, you can tap on the "Enter Slide Over" button.

            I have a simple question for Senator Ted Cruz: Who was president in 2018? How about 2020? I ask because Cruz just released a “bombshell” report claiming that the Biden administration &#8220;converted&#8221; CISA into &#8220;the Thought Police.&#8221; There&#8217;s just one tiny problem with this narrative: Cruz&#8217;s own report shows that everything he&#8217;s mad about started [&#8230;]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Spam calls have become such a nuisance that many people simply don't answer their phone unless they recognize the number. In iOS 26, though, you can learn about who's calling before you respond, thanks to a clever new feature that intercepts unknown calls and asks the caller to identify themselves before your iPhone even rings.

<br/>
The new "Ask Reason for Calling" feature is kind of like having your own receptionist. When someone who isn't in your Contacts calls, your iPhone automatically answers the call with a polite automated message asking for their name and reason for calling. The caller is placed on hold while their response is transcribed to text and displayed on your screen, letting you decide whether to accept, decline, or ask for more information.

Apple CEO Tim Cook has once again paid tribute to Jobs.

<br/>
<br/>
Cook also reflected on Jobs while opening Apple's first-ever event at Steve Jobs Theater in 2017.

"There is not a day that goes by that we don't think about him," he said then.
