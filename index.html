            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today stopped signing iOS 18.3.2, a week after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/31/apple-releases-ios-18-4/">releasing the iOS 18.4 update</a>. Now that iOS 18.3.2 is not being signed, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users who have upgraded to iOS 18.4 are not able to downgrade to a version of iOS 18.3.

<br/>
It is typical for Apple to stop signing an older version of iOS after releasing an update, and the process keeps ‌iPhone‌ users from installing outdated versions of iOS. "Signing" refers to a server-side verification check that's done when versions of iOS are downloaded onto an ‌iPhone‌. Only software that passes the verification check is able to be installed.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-04-07 14:23:44-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Ahead of when new reciprocal tariffs go into effect on April 9, Apple customers are scrambling to buy devices before prices go up. Multiple Apple employees that spoke to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-07/apple-customers-dash-to-stores-to-buy-iphones-ahead-of-tariffs">Bloomberg</a></em> said their stores have been packed with customers "panic-buying" iPhones. "Almost every customer asked me if prices were going to go up soon," one Apple worker was quoted as saying.

<br/>
The rush at retail stores was comparable to the busyness of a holiday season, with Apple providing no guidance on what employees should tell customers. Apple's retail stores reportedly experienced higher sales on April 5 and 6 than they have in prior years during the same time period.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-04-07 12:41:40-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            To lessen the impact from the tariffs that U.S. President Donald Trump is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/02/apple-stock-trump-tariffs/">putting in place this month</a>, Apple will import more iPhones to the U.S. from India, reports <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-iphone-production-china-tariffs-6cc37f40">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>.

<br/>
The 26 percent tariff on goods imported from India will be less of a hit to Apple's bottom line than the 54 percent tariff on goods from China, the 46 percent tariff in Vietnam, or the 36 percent tariff in Thailand.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple does not plan to make major changes to its supply chain because the tariff situation is "too uncertain." Sourcing more U.S. iPhones from India will offset the cost of the tariffs in China, and Apple is viewing that as a short term solution wh [...]<br>

<br/>
Apple shares opened at $177.24 today, as the company's stock price has continued to drop since U.S. President Donald Trump last week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/02/apple-stock-trump-tariffs/">announced steep new tariffs</a>. The tariffs will significantly impact Apple, which still assembles the majority of iPhones and many other devices in China, which is facing a 54% tariff starting April 9.

            Apple is likely to take a multi-pronged approach to manage the impact of impending tariffs on its products, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-04-06/will-apple-raise-iphone-prices-in-the-us-after-trump-tariffs-iphone-17-details"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

The upcoming tariffs range from 20% to 46% across Apple's global manufacturing hubs. India, where Apple increasingly builds iPhones and AirPods, will face a 26% tariff. Vietnam, which produces AirPods, iPads, Apple Watches and Macs, will be hit with a 46% levy. Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and even Ireland will face tariffs between a 20% and 37%.

            Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models will feature a redesigned rear camera panel that spans the width of the device, but it will be the same color as the iPhone itself, rather than being part of a two-tone design.

            If you have an older Apple device that you've been considering upgrading, you're probably wondering how the newly announced tariffs might impact prices going forward, and whether it's worth buying now before there's a price hike.
