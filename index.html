Last year, the U.S. passed a law that required Chinese company ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok due to potential national security risks, or else the platform would be banned. That law <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/tiktok-january-19-ban-imminent/">went into effect today</a>, and companies like Apple and Google risked enormous fines if they did not remove access to TikTok and other ByteDance-owned apps.
