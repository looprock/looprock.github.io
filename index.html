            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Popular virtual reality rhythm game Beat Saber could be one title that Apple is planning to promote for its upcoming AR/VR headset, according to a tweet shared by Beat Games co-founder Jaroslav Beck.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Beck today shared a tweet about June 5th, saying that the date would be "🍿🕶️," which seems to hint that a version of Beat Saber for the Apple AR/VR headset could perhaps be part of Apple's presentation. Beat Saber for Apple's platform is just speculation at this point, but Beck does not regularly tweet about Apple, and would seemingly have no reason to comment on the event.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            TL;DR: As we move towards a more decentralized web, new and complex security challenges arise. The open-source nature of Web3 means that code vulnerabilities are common and can spread quickly. To address these challenges, we need to prioritize trust and security. We can do this by scanning for Smart Contract vulnerabilities, strengthening IAM for cloud environments, providing visibility into web3 applications, utilizing AI/ML techniques, and regularly auditing and monitoring the system. By continuously testing and monitoring the system, we can stay ahead of potential threats and ensure a secure and reliable digital landscape.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In recent years, consumption or usage (vs subscription) based business models have proliferated in existence as more and more customers demand value and flexibility from their vendors. This trend is easiest to observe in cloud-based software infrastructure companies like Snowflake, Databricks, MongoDB and Confluent - all of whom have implemented the consumption-based model for their cloud product and services.<br>

            After the crypto summer was replaced by the crypto fall, most coins tumbled by 50% and even 90%. But does that mean you can’t make money on crypto today? 
No, it absolutely doesn’t! A successful investor has the ability to profit in the long run. Anyone could earn in the crypto summer, but it definitely takes effort to preserve and increase wealth in the crypto winter.<br>

            Apple is overtly teasing the start of "a new era" and the ability to "code new worlds" at WWDC this year, building anticipation around the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/15/kuo-apple-well-prepared-headset-unveiling/">widely expected</a> announcement of its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ar-vr/">mixed-reality headset</a>.

<br/>
A tweet shared by Apple earlier today made the "new era" remark, seemingly leaning into the high expectations surrounding next week's WWDC keynote. The launch of a major new device and operating system, something that has not occurred since the debut of the original Apple Watch in September 2014, would certainly seem to justify the start of a new era for the company.
