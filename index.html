            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 26.3 is shaping up to be a relatively minor update, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/21/ios-26-3-coming-soon/">only a couple of notable new features</a>, but iOS 26.4 is expected to be much more significant.

<br/>
We are still waiting for the iOS 26.3 Release Candidate to come out, so the first iOS 26.4 beta is likely still at least a few weeks away. Following beta testing, iOS 26.4 will likely be released to the general public at some point in March or April.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today began notifying Apple Cash users about an upcoming fee increase for the Instant Transfer feature. Starting on February 18, 2026, choosing the Instant Transfer option will cost 1.7 percent of the transaction amount, with a minimum of $0.25 and a maximum of $25.

Instant Transfer is the Apple Cash option that allows you to transfer money from Apple Cash to your bank account with no waiting period. The current fee is 1.5 percent of the transaction amount, with the same $0.25 minimum fee and a lower $15 maximum fee.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Popular password management app 1Password today announced the launch of a new phishing protection feature that's meant to "act as a second pair of eyes" before users provide their passwords to scammers.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
1Password will not autofill a username and password on a website that is spoofing another as one layer of protection, but users can get around that by manually retrieving their usernames and passwords.
<br/>
<br/>
To add further protection, when a user attempts to paste their username and password into a website, the 1Password browser extension will display a pop-up warning that prompts them to pause and use caution before continuing. 1Password hopes that the warning will cause users to take a second, more careful look at the website before proceeding.

The phishing protection feature will be turned on by default for individual and family plan users, while 1Password Admins can turn it on for employees. The protection is rolling out starting [...]<br>
