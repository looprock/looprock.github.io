According to Kuo's latest report outlining <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/kuo-iphone-17e-still-on-apple-2026-roadmap/">Apple's roadmap through 2027</a>, the iPhone 19 Air will feature a larger display compared to the iPhone 18 Air model that's expected to debut a year earlier. 
<br/>
<br/>
While specific dimensions weren't disclosed, Kuo specifically noted the device would offer "a larger display vs. 18 Slim" in his product timeline. Kuo presumably uses the "Slim" nomenclature as a placeholder for Apple's rumored ultra-thin device – the first of which is expected this September – which we are calling the iPhone 17 A [...]<br>

            Earlier this year, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-announces-iphone-16e/">released the iPhone 16e</a>, a more affordable iPhone 16 model that starts at $599 in the United States.

<br/>
While the iPhone 16e effectively replaced the iPhone SE, it is also a first-of-its-kind device, so the release cadence for future models has yet to be established. In other words, it is unclear if Apple will release an iPhone 17e next year.

Apple only updated the iPhone SE once every few years, and a new report suggests that trend might continue with the "e" model.
