            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When watching content through the Disney+ streaming service, Vision Pro users can now opt into a new Immersive Environment that launched today.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960807" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/disney-plus-vision-pro-iceland.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
Available from National Geographic, the Immersive Environment features views of the Thingvellir National Park in Iceland. The new environment will allow Disney+ subscribers on Vision Pro to experience the rocky terrain of Thingvellir National Park on a snowy winter day, complete with interactive elements and sounds designed to make the space come to live.
<br/>
<br/>
The site was captured by a team of National Geographic photographers, and it can be set as a backdrop for watching Disney+ content underneath a nighttime aurora. The images for the Immersive Environment were captured using photogrammetry and gigapixel panoramas.
