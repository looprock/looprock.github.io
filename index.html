            <b>Published:</b> 2023-06-13 09:08:34-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The first <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/1578788">Geekbench 6 benchmark result</a> for the new Mac Pro surfaced today, providing a closer look at the M2 Ultra chip's CPU performance in the desktop tower.

<br/>
The result lists a single-core score of 2,794 and a multi-core score of 21,453, compared to 1,378 and 10,390 for the highest-end Intel-based Mac Pro with a 28-core Xeon W processor, a configuration that started at $12,999. This means the new Mac Pro is over twice as fast as the fastest Intel-based model, and given that all configurations include the M2 Ultra chip, this performance can be had for a much lower $6,999.

Bergeron said the 15-inch MacBook Air having the same battery life as the 13-inch model is the result of "thermal control loops and software optimizations."<blockquote>There's definitely thermal control loops and software optimizations that we use.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-06-13 06:31:16-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 17 and macOS Sonoma, turning off iCloud Drive no longer impacts third-party apps that use Apple's iCloud database to sync their data, a notable change that is likely to be welcomed by both developers and users.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900104" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/icloud-drive.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
In previous versions of macOS and iOS, when iCloud Drive is manually disabled in System Settings or the Settings app, this also turns off iCloud (i.e. CloudKit) database access for third-party apps, even if they don't use an iCloud Drive folder. This is despite the fact that iCloud syncing of Apple's own stock apps remains unaffected.
<br/>
<br/>
This behavior is not made clear in Apple's user-facing settings, which confusingly include separate switches to turn iCloud on and off individually for iCloud Drive, system apps, and third-party apps.

<br/>
Moreover, iCloud Drive can take a considerable amount o [...]<br>

Originally spotted by <em><a href="https://news.mydrivers.com/1/915/915819.htm">MyDrivers</a></em>, the trademark was originally granted to Huawei on May 16, 2019, and gives the company exclusive rights to its use in China from November 28, 2021 to November 27, 2031.

Huawei actively uses the trademark in China, and offers a number of products under the Vision name, including smart TVs and smart glasses. If Apple intends to sell its headset in China and call it Vision Pro, it may have to enter into negotiations with Huawei to release the trademark for a price.
