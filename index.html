<br/>
Priced at $100, the speaker has a squat, rounded shape with a 3D knit fabric covering and a colorful light ring at the bottom so you know when the speaker is listening. It comes in Jade, Berry, Porcelain, and Hazel. Google says the speaker offers richer, 360-degree sound, balanced acoustics, and the ability to pair multiple speakers together.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iFixit today disassembled the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a>, giving us a look at what's inside and how the ‌AirPods Pro 3‌ have changed in comparison to the AirPods Pro 2. 
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Apple designed the ‌AirPods Pro 3‌ with a new foam-infused tip, and the design change is mainly visible under a microscope. You can see a small layer of foam at the top of the earbud where it meets the ear. 
<br/>
<br/>
The AirPods have a 0.221 Wh battery cell inside, while the case has a single 1.334 Wh battery. The AirPods Pro 2 had two battery cells inside the case, and the change explains why we're down to 24 hours of battery life from the case instead of 30 hours like the AirPods Pro 2. 
<br/>
<br/>
The case has fewer rare earth magnets inside, but they've been placed in different locations to ensure that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> and Qi 2 charging still works as expected.

<br/>
With its ultra-thin titanium frame, large display, and glass back, the ‌iPhone Air‌ takes a different aesthetic direction from the rest of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> lineup. This year's finishes emphasize lightness and subtle sophistication, reflecting the phone's positioning as Apple's thinnest and most design-focused device. 
<br/>
<br/>
Both Apple's frosted and bumper cases noticeably show the device's color. The Air's full-width camera plateau draws attention to the device's color even with a case, making it all the more important to choose wisely.

            The UK government has issued a new request for Apple to provide access to encrypted <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> user data, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d101fd62-14f9-4f51-beff-ea41e8794265"><em>Financial Times</em></a> reports.

<br/>
<br/>
The report reveals that, in early September, the UK Home Office demanded that Apple creates a way for officials to access encrypted ‌iCloud‌ backups. Unlike its previous order, the latest request focuses on the ‌iCloud‌ data of British citizens specifically. The demand is designed to aid law enforcement with investigations into terrorism and child sexual abuse.

In a Texas filing Tuesday, Apple's lawyers defended the company's decision to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, claiming it did nothing wrong in selecting OpenAI as its initial generative AI partner. The filing says it is "widely known that Apple intends to partner with other generative AI chatbots" beyond OpenAI in the future.

            The United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has seemingly confirmed Apple's work on an updated version of the Vision Pro headset.

One of several documents the FCC shared today references an Apple-designed "Head Mounted Device" with a model number of A3416. An included image confirms the device is a Vision Pro.

The FCC's uploads are transmission tests, SAR test reports, and WLAN test reports, so there's not a lot of additional product information available. We do know that the next Vision Pro will continue to have Wi-Fi 6, as there's no sign of 6GHz Wi-Fi in the testing that the FCC did.
