            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The article discusses the benefits of Platform as a Service (PaaS) in the cloud computing landscape. PaaS empowers developers to build applications without getting entangled in underlying complexities, offering hardware and software tools on dedicated infrastructure. It is compared to Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS), highlighting PaaS advantages. PaaS simplifies management, accelerates deployment, aids scalability, enhances customization, supports innovation, and improves data management. Aptible, a PaaS solution, is featured for its security, vulnerability management, efficient operations, and expert support. While PaaS has significant benefits, it's not without challenges like dependency, customization limits, and vendor lock-in. PaaS remains a preferred choice for businesses seeking streamlined development and scaling processes.<br>

            <p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>\
Today, I would like to highlight a really interesting topic: how to implement an additional authentication layer over a service that does not offer it out of the box. Namely, how to add Azure AD Authentication on your side over a service-side JWT token authentication.</p>
<p>\
It’s a good exercise in case your third-party service does not support SSO authentication (or you just don’t want to pay much for it) - but you would be happy with a simple solution. All you need is <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-quick-and-friendly-python-3-guide-for-beginners">Python</a>, Docker, and, surely, an understanding of what you are going to do. Don’t use this solution in production as it is :)</p>

Like Nomad's other Sport Band options, the Glow in the Dark model is made from FKM fluoroelastomer rubber, and it is waterproof, so it can be worn when swimming, in the ocean, and during sweaty activities.

There's a pin-and-tuck mechanism to close the band for a secure closure, and interior ventilation channels add breathability to keep the watch band from getting too moist underneath, similar to Apple's Nike bands. In our testing, the Sport Band does in [...]<br>
