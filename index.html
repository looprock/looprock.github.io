            <b>Published:</b> 2026-02-02 13:25:17-08:00<p>

Apple's work on a head-mounted device was the subject of rumors for many years before the Vision Pro's announcement. By the early 2020s, those reports had converged around the idea that Apple was preparing a high-end mixed-reality headset positioned as a new form of general-purpose computer.

<p>AI is still stuck in “efficiency mode.” In many organizations, a technology organization leads AI efforts and is treated as a cost center. Those CIOs are incentivized to optimize for efficiency, not growth. The result is predictable: Tech-led AI strategies deliver productivity improvements, but not transformation. Equally concerning is that technology and AI executives tell us their business partners can’t articulate what they want from AI beyond saving money. That leadership gap bleeds over into the measurement of AI value. While most agree that AI boosts productivity, only 13% report positive EBITDA impact, and fewer than a third link AI contributions to P&amp;L. Without financial accountability, AI becomes an endless pilot treadmill — producing activity without outcomes. To shift AI from incremental savings to strategic advantage, business leaders must step in, define value in P&amp;L terms, and own the linkage between AI-driven productivity and financial performance.

According to the paywalled report, demand for smart glasses from the likes of Meta is rising steadily, but the industry now expects Apple's equivalent product to act as the primary catalyst for large-scale commercialization. Multiple suppliers across Taiwan's optical sector have apparently increased capital expenditure to expand capacity and shift research priorities toward AR technologies, citing Apple's expected requirements.

For example, Kinko Optical has positioned itself as a key supplier by opening a new AR, VR, and MR research center, backed by an investment of about $5.6 mil [...]<br>

According <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/the-ai-boom-is-coming-for-apples-profit-margins-4774013d">to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, Apple is exploring whether some of its lower-end processors could be manufactured by a company other than TSMC.
<br/>
<br/>
"Now that TSMC is doing more business with Nvidia and other AI companies, people with knowledge of the chip supply chain said Apple was exploring whether some lower-end processors could be made by someone other than TSMC," the report said.
<br/>
<br/>
The report did not mention any candidates, but previous rumors have indicated that Intel could begin supplying some lower-end Apple processors in 2027 or 2028.

            Introduction Modern advertising platforms are fast-paced and interconnected: even small adjustments can have ripple effects on how ads are shown, how budgets are spent, and the value advertisers get from their ad spend. At Yelp, Ad Budget Allocation means splitting each campaign’s spend between on‑platform inventory (our website, mobile site, and app) and off‑platform inventory (the Yelp Ad Network). We optimize this split to meet advertisers’ performance goals while growing overall revenue. Due to the complexity of the budget allocation system and its feedback loop, even small changes can lead to unexpected system‑wide effects. To help us safely evaluate changes,...<br>

In a new post, the Weibo user known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fixed-focus-digital/">Fixed Focus Digital</a>" says that the foldable's battery could be over 5,500 mAh in size, which would make it the largest capacity of any current or previous ‌iPhone‌.
