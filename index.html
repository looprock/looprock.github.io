            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-28 07:53:58-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Microsoft today announced that it will officially retire Skype on May 5, 2025, concluding its 14-year tenure as the owner of the once-dominant internet calling and messaging service (via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-28/microsoft-msft-to-shut-down-skype-as-zoom-teams-dominate-video-calls"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>).

<br/>
Microsoft acquired Skype in 2011 for $8.5 billion in what was then its largest-ever acquisition. At its peak, Skype had more than 300 million monthly active users and was synonymous with internet-based voice and video calling. The service steadily declined in relevance in recent years, with its active user base shrinking to approximately 36 million by 2023 as competitors such as Zoom, WhatsApp, and Microsoft's own Teams platform gained traction.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-28 07:12:54-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's new entry-level iPhone 16e has inherited the Action button first seen on the iPhone 15 Pro and now found on all iPhone 16 models. The Action button replaces the traditional Ring/Silent switch – a staple of the iPhone since it launched in 2007. For users unfamiliar with the Action button, here's a rundown of its functions – including one that is (currently) exclusive to iPhone 16e.

<br/>
The Action button replaces the single-function switch used to toggle between ring and silent, offering additional options so users can choose between quickly accessing the camera or flashlight, activate Voice Memos, Focus modes, Translate, and accessibility features like Magnifier. Users can also associate it with Shortcuts for more options.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is collaborating with the National Hockey League (NHL) to equip on-ice officials with Apple Watches featuring an app designed to help officiating during games (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/621004/nhl-watch-comms-apple-watch-wearables-smartwatch"><em>The Verge</em></a>).

<br/>
The NHL Watch Comms app allows referees to receive in-game updates by syncing with the NHL's Oasis system. Officials can track the game clock and receive alerts for key game events without diverting their focus. This allows referees to avoid locating video boards while officiating.

The app includes haptic feedback to indicate key moments, such as when a player leaves the penalty box or when the period is about to end. Distinct haptic patterns allow referees to differentiate between different notifications without needing to  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has offered a reason why the iPhone 16e doesn't include MagSafe, one of the more notable omissions from its latest entry-level smartphone.

<br/>
According to Apple representatives who spoke to <em><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/the_iphone_16e">Daring Fireball</a></em>'s John Gruber, MagSafe is not included in the iPhone 16e because "most people in the iPhone 16e's target audience exclusively charge their phones by plugging them into a charging cable."
<br/>
<br/>
These users apparently tend not to use wireless charging at all, and when they do use it, Apple believes the slower 7.5W Qi charging speed compared to MagSafe's faster rates isn't a deciding factor for the customer segment it is targeting with the more affordable device.

Introduced with the iPhone 12 lineup in 2020, MagSafe uses magnets  [...]<br>
