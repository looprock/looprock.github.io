            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iOS 16, iPadOS 16, and macOS Ventura last year, Apple introduced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/06/ios-16-lockdown-mode/">Lockdown Mode</a>, an optional security setting designed to protect the "very small number" of users who may be at risk of "highly targeted cyberattacks" from companies developing state-sponsored spyware, such as journalists, activists, and government employees.

<br/>
Starting with iOS 17 and watchOS 10, enabling Lockdown Mode on an iPhone also turns on Lockdown Mode on a paired Apple Watch. Apple says Lockdown Mode provides an "extreme" level of security, with strict limitations on apps, websites, and features.

At launch, Lockdown Mode included the following protections:<ul><li>In the Messages app, most message attachment types other than images are blocked, and some features</li></ul> [...]<br>

            There are some questions about whether or not Section 230 protects AI companies from being liable for the output from their generative AI tools.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-06-15 09:39:29-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If you change your iPhone's passcode and forget it soon after, iOS 17 has a new option available to help out. Specifically, it is now possible to reset an iPhone's new passcode with the previous passcode for up to 72 hours after the change is made.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-900578" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/iOS-17-Passcode-Reset-72-Hours-Feature.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
If you enter an incorrect passcode, tapping on "Forgot Passcode?" at the bottom of the screen will lead to another screen with a "Try Passcode Reset" option. Tapping this option allows you to enter the iPhone's previous passcode and create a new passcode.
<br/>
<br/>
As a safeguard, an option in the Settings app lets you expire the previous passcode immediately so that it cannot be used to reset the new passcode.
