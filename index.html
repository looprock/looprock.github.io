            It will likely be years before Apple Intelligence has a compelling enough feature set that people will pay for, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said in this week's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-11/iphone-16-preview-bigger-screens-new-colors-camera-button-ai-and-a18-chip-lzpk5495">Power On newsletter</a>. Apple Intelligence is still so new that Gurman expects it will "take three years" for Apple to create a product that's worth charging for, and even that "may be the best-case scenario."

<br/>
The wallpapers feature the sequoia trees that ‌macOS Sequoia‌ is named for. The imagery likely comes from Sequoia National Park, located in the southern Sierra Nevada mountains of California. There are three separate versions of the wallpaper for different times of day: Sequoia Sunrise, Sequoia Morning, and Sequoia Night.
<br/>

Each wallpaper is animated and will shift slightly at the Lock Screen when you unlock your Mac, plus there is an option to set it as a screen saver.
