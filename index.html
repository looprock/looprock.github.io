            Apple is facing a new lawsuit from consumers who allege that its claim that the Apple Watch Series 9, SE, and Ultra 2 are "carbon neutral" is misleading, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-sued-over-carbon-neutral-claim-watches-2025-02-27/"><em>Reuters</em></a> reports.

<br/>
Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the lawsuit argues that Apple misrepresented the environmental impact of these three Apple Watch models by relying on carbon offset projects that did not provide genuine carbon reductions. The plaintiffs claim they would not have bought their devices or would have paid less had they known this.

The complaint centers on two carbon offset projects Apple uses to support its carbon neutrality efforts: Kenya's Chyulu Hills Project and China's Guinan  [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-26 12:44:38-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iOS 18.4, Apple made a small tweak to Safari that could be polarizing because it puts your search history front and center. When you open up a new Safari tab and then tap into the search field, Safari shows your recent search history.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991973" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/ios-18-4-safari-search.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
In iOS 18.3.1, opening up a new tab and then tapping into search does not show your history, and the view remains on the personalized Safari home page. iOS 18.3.1 has no clear view of prior searches at all, except that a recent search will show up in your suggested results if you search for the same thing again.

As noted by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/25/ios-184-makes-your-safari-search-history-way-more-visible/">9to5Mac</a></em>, having Safari search so visible may not always be desirable if you're ever in a situation where you hand your &lt;a href="https://ww [...]<br>

While the average customer is unlikely to care about this change, it is a big deal for Apple, which had been working on its own cellular modem since at least 2018.

<br/>
We are still waiting on C1 modem speed tests, but it is expected that Apple's first modem will provide slower 5G speeds compared to Qualcomm's Snapdragon X71 modem in iPhone 16 models. Apple surely aims to eventually catch up to or even surpass Qualcomm in modem performance, but that goal might take several years.
