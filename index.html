            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-06 07:26:48-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Spam calls have become such a nuisance that many people simply don't answer their phone unless they recognize the number. In iOS 26, though, you can learn about who's calling before you respond, thanks to a clever new feature that intercepts unknown calls and asks the caller to identify themselves before your iPhone even rings.

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012692" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iOS-26-Phone-App-Features.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
The new "Ask Reason for Calling" feature is kind of like having your own receptionist. When someone who isn't in your Contacts calls, your iPhone automatically answers the call with a polite automated message asking for their name and reason for calling. The caller is placed on hold while their response is transcribed to text and displayed on your screen, letting you decide whether to accept, decline, or ask for more information.

Apple CEO Tim Cook has once again paid tribute to Jobs.
<br/>
<br/>
"Steve saw the future as a bright and boundless place, lit the path forward, and inspired us to follow," said Cook, in a <a href="https://x.com/tim_cook/status/1974822379663589796">post</a> today. "We miss you, my friend."
<br/>
<br/>
Cook also reflected on Jobs while opening Apple's first-ever event at Steve Jobs Theater in 2017.
<br/>
<br/>
"There is not a day that goes by that we don't think about him," he said then.

Apple just debuted the ‌AirPods Pro 3‌, adding new features like improved active noise cancellation, the U2 chip, and heart rate monitoring. The AirPods Pro 2 were already more advanced than the ‌AirPods Max‌, which have not been meaningfully refreshed since their introduction in 2020, so the ‌AirPods Pro 3‌ take an even bigger leap ahead of their over-ear siblings. Nevertheless, there is still a good case for buying the ‌AirPods Max‌ against the AirPods Pro.
