            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple often refreshes Apple Watch band colors on a seasonal basis, and code in iOS 17.4 suggests that new spring colors will be coming soon.
<br/>

<br/>
As found by <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveMoser"><em>MacRumors</em> contributor Steve Moser</a>, the spring colors include Light Blue, Ocean Blue, Pink, Raspberry, Soft Mint, and Sunshine (likely a light yellow). There are also two Hermes colors, Bleu Céleste and Jaune de Naples.
<br/>
<br/>
When released, these colors will be available for watch faces that support different color options, and they'll be listed in a Spring 2024 section in the Apple Watch app on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. Right now, the colors are not showing up there.

            Apple is working on an updated version of its popular Beats Solo on-ear headphones, according to code located in the iOS 17.4 release candidate that Apple put out today. <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris found several references to the Beats Solo 4 headphones, including images.

<br/>
The Beats Solo 4 look similar to the Solo 3 headphones, but have design tweaks that bring them in line with the Beats Studio Pro. Spatial Audio is supported according to the code, but we don't know what other features to expect at this time.

<br/>
There are three colors in the files, including black, pink, and blue.
