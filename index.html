            Most <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users are familiar with Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/live-photos/">Live Photos</a>, which capture 1.5 seconds of video before and after you take a picture, with the aim of adding a little bit of life and movement to still images. What some users might not know is that you can also make a Live Photo bounce back and forth like a boomerang.

If you're familiar with Instagram, you probably know what a boomerang is. Since introducing ‌Live Photos‌ in 2015, Apple has added some effects to its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app that let you turn them into fun animated clips, and the Bounce effect is basically the same thing as a boomerang. It rewinds the action backward and forward. Here's how to make one of your ow [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            YouTube channel Phone Repair Guru has shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvW-I8EczZ4">teardown video</a> for the new 13-inch iPad Pro with the M4 chip, providing a first look at the device's internal design changes.

During its iPad event last week, Apple said it was able to improve the thermal performance of the new iPad Pro models by nearly 20% compared to the previous-generation models by adding graphite sheets to the chassis and infusing the rear Apple logo with copper. These changes can be seen towards the end of the teardown video.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-05-17 07:10:45-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Developers who want to develop browsers for iOS with third-party engines can only test their apps on devices physically located in the EU, according to <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/17/apple_browser_eu/"><em>The Register</em></a>.

<br/>
This rule introduces a considerable barrier for developers outside the EU, who are now limited to using simulators instead of actual devices for testing their browsers. This restriction complicates the process of developing and supporting browsers with alternative engines, as on-device testing is essential to accurate performance assessment and troubleshooting. Apple's previous policy, which remains in place in other regions around the world, demands the use of WebKit for all iOS and iPadOS browsers, effectively making every browser on these platforms a variant of Safari.

<br/>
The program allowed university professors and other eligible instructors to create a development team with up to 200 students, who could create and test apps without needing to pay the usual $99 annual fee for Apple Developer Program membership.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple says accredited educational institutions can still enroll in the Apple Developer Program at no cost by submitting a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/fee-waiver/">fee waiver request</a>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The first M4 iPad Pro bend tests are in, and the initial consensus appears to be that Apple has managed to make its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/08/ipod-nano-appears-in-new-ipad-pro-ad/">thinnest device ever</a> just as durable as the previous generation M2 iPad Pro that it replaces.

Two approaches were taken in bend tests by prominent tech YouTubers. <a href="https://youtu.be/GN6ZlssqNAE">JerryRigEverything</a> for example forcibly applied pressure by bending the new device with his hands, while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6LSoVJZfAU">MobileReviewsEh</a> took a different tack by placing the iPad under a force meter and applying gym weights on top to exert pressure within a limited contact area.

            iPhone users often find themselves toggling between different keyboard layouts to type messages, emails, or fill out forms. This can slow down communication and disrupt your flow. But there are ways to streamline the process. If this quick tip is new to you, it could revolutionize the way you type on your iPhone and save you precious time.

<br/>
With the help of some magnet paper, MKBHD <a href="https://x.com/MKBHD/status/1790718481102434503">reveals</a> that Apple has added bigger, more cubic magnets to the M4 iPad Pro that align with a new longer rail of stripe magnets in the Folio Case, thereby achieving a wider range of viewing angle adjustment.
<br/>
<br/>
The magnet paper also reveals that, because of how thin the new iPad Pro is compared to the previous generation model, Apple has had to use flatter, more circular speaker drivers, which appear to be closer to the top of the device.
