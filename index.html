            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Ever searched for something specific, only to be met with results that are <em>close, but not quite</em>? On Etsy’s Search Relevance team, that frustration is exactly what we are tackling. Our goal is simple yet ambitious: to help buyers find exactly what they’re looking for, and to help sellers reach the people seeking their special products.</p>
<p>Search plays a central role in that mission. Historically, Etsy’s search models have relied heavily on engagement signals – such as clicks, add-to-carts, and purchases – as proxies for relevance. These signals are objective, but they can also be biased: popular listings get more clicks, even when they’re not the best match for a specific query.</p>
<p>To address this, we introduce semantic relevance as a complementary perspective to engagement, capturing how well a listing aligns with a buyer’s intent as expressed in their query. We developed a <strong>Semantic Relevance Evaluation and Enhancement Framework</strong>, powered by large language models (LLMs). It</p> [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2026-01-16 09:06:40-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple increasingly has to compete with other companies for chips made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), as surging demand for artificial intelligence reshapes capacity and customer priority.

<br/>
According to a detailed report published by semiconductor analyst Tim Culpan on his blog <em><a href="https://www.culpium.com/p/exclusiveapple-is-fighting-for-tsmc">Culpium</a></em>, Apple is no longer guaranteed preferential access to leading-edge manufacturing capacity at TSMC, marking a notable change after more than a decade in which Apple's chips were central to the foundry's expansion strategy. Apple is now competing directly with AI-focused customers such as Nvidia and AMD for supply, particularly at the most advanced process nodes.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Development of Apple's rumored OLED MacBook Pro took another forward step this month when the next-generation production line responsible for manufacturing its displays commenced operation.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984552" height="1265" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/M6-MacBook-Pro-Feature-1.jpg" width="2250"/>
<br/>
Samsung Display is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/oled-macbook-pro-coming-next-year/">expected</a> to make the panels for Apple's MacBook Pro, and has invested heavily in an 8.6-generation OLED production line located at its Asan campus in South Korea. 
<br/>
<br/>
An 8.6G fab uses much larger glass substrates than the OLED lines used for smartphones, which allows multiple laptop-sized panels to be cut from a single sheet. This improves yields and lowers costs, which is just what Apple needs if OLED is to replace mini-LED in the MacBook Pro.

The line is designed around rigid OLED panels with oxide TF [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2026-01-16 01:58:28-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's foldable iPhone will share the same next-generation A20 Pro chip as the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max models when it debuts this September, according to industry analyst Jeff Pu.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1015809" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/Apple-Foldable-Thumb.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
In his latest investor note, Pu outlined the projected specifications for all three premium devices that will take center stage this fall, with the regular iPhone 18 and more affordable iPhone 18e models not expected to debut until spring 2027 as part of Apple's new split-launch strategy.  
<br/>
<br/>
Powered by the A20 Pro chip, the iPhone Fold and iPhone 18 Pro models will showcase TSMC's new 2nm process, N2, boasting performance improvements that could be up to 15 percent faster and 30 percent more efficient than A19 chips. 
<br/>

<br/>
The browser's AI assistant now uses architecture borrowed from Opera's experimental <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/30/opera-ai-browser-neon-launch/">Neon browser</a>, which the company says delivers 20% faster responses. Notably, the AI can now operate within the context of specific tabs or tab groups, so it doesn't mix up information across different browsing sessions. There's also a new YouTube integration that lets the AI analyze videos to find specific moments or summarize content.

The carrier said affected customers can accept the credit by logging into the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-verizon/id416023011">My Verizon app</a>, but it might take some time before this option shows up in the app. Affected customers will receive a text message when the credit is available.

<p>I can see how it happens. You get an app into production, it runs fine, and then you moveon to the next thing. Meanwhile, the version drifts into “End of Life” territory. OSS support ends (like way back in mid-2023 for the Spring version DaShaun mentioned). If you’re running that today without a commercial contract, you are missing over a dozen essential security patches. Or hoping you can handle it yourself…</p>
<p>Better options are:</p>

<p>Upgrade: Move to the supported versions (Spring Boot 3.x or the new 4.x). We have a tool, the Application Advisor, that automates a massive chunk of this migration.
