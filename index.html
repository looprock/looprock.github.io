<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/">Aaron Perris</a> discovered several references to the ability to load games in the latest version of the Uber app, released on Monday. One line of code says that the gaming feature will require an internet connection.

It is unclear when Uber plans to make the mini games available to the public, and there is no guarantee that the feature will launch. No further details are known at this time, beyond the new lines of code added to the app, so we cannot confirm if the games will be available for free or require in-app purcha [...]<br>

            Folium has become the first Nintendo 3DS emulator for the iPhone <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/folium/id6498623389">available in the App Store</a>, although there are some caveats to be aware of.

<br/>
Foremost, this is the first Nintendo emulator on the App Store that costs money. Folium developer Jarrod Norwell is charging $4.99 for the app, which is a bold choice given that Nintendo recently sued the developers of Yuzu, a Nintendo Switch emulator that made a profit off a subscription-based "early access" tier. Yuzu reached a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">$2.4 million settlement</a> with Nintendo and discontinued its emulator earlier this year.

            Apple is planning a major AI overhaul in iOS 18, but some new features are unlikely to work on older iPhones, even if they do appear on the new operating system's device compatibility list.

Apple's initial AI roadmap for iOS 18 is said to come in two parts: Basic AI features that will be processed on-device, and more advanced capabilities that will require communication with Apple's servers.

As it turns out, Recall might be a security nightmare for Windows users.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today shared a trio of humorous Mac ads that focus on the battery life, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a>, and the performance capabilities of Apple silicon notebooks. The "Charged" ad, for example, shows a serious professor commenting on a student's remaining battery life.

In "Powered," a student in a library is approached by a woman who says that laptops aren't meant to handle big files and multiple apps. "You think it won't crash?" she says. "You're a hot dog in a hurricane." The student lets her know that "it's a Mac," so it's "running fine."

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-06-03 09:10:38-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is unlikely to release a foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> before 2027, but it could significantly disrupt the market when it launches, according to Taiwanese research firm <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20240603-12170.html">TrendForce</a>.

<br/>
The report highlights that foldable phones currently represent a mere 1.5% of the smartphone market, with projections suggesting an increase to 4.8% by 2028. Apple is apparently "still evaluating component specifications and performance, with strict requirements for crease and reliability." Screen creasing is an issue that plagues many current foldable devices, raising concerns about long-term durability and the risk of screen damage from debris.
