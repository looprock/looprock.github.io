            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Foreign-branded smartphone shipments in China, dominated by Apple's iPhone, dropped dramatically in March 2025, plunging 49.6% year-over-year according to data released by The China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT).

<br/>
The steep decline saw shipments fall to just 1.89 million units, down from 3.75 million during the same period last year. That shrinks Apple's share of the Chinese market to approximately 8%, while domestic brands now control 92% of smartphone shipments.

For the entire first quarter, non-Chinese brand shipments declined over 25%, while total smartphone shipments in China actually increased by 3.3%.

            Samsung today introduced the <a href="https://howl.link/chaeu38jiafc4">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, an ultra thin smartphone that will compete with Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> "Air." The Galaxy S25 Edge features a 6.7-inch AMOLED display and it measures in at 5.8mm thick.

Comparatively, rumors suggest that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a> will have a 6.6-inch display and a thickness of 5.5mm, so it may be slightly smaller and thinner than the S25 Edge. The Galaxy S25 Edge weighs 163 grams, so the thin design and the light weight are noticeable when it is compared to a standard Galaxy S25 Ultra or a current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> Max. The Galaxy S25 Ultra weighs 218 grams, while the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max weighs 227 grams.

            Apple is planning to implement a change to pasteboard (aka your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s internal clipboard) that will prevent Mac apps from being able to read the pasteboard without the user being alerted, according to information Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/updates/appkit">has shared with developers</a>.

<br/>
In macOS 16, Mac users will get an alert when a Mac app reads the pasteboard without direct user interaction. This change means apps won't be able to surreptitiously view the things you've copied and pasted.

Mac users won't see an alert with a direct pasteboard-related action, like when copying and pasting text within an app that supports it. Users will be notified if an app tries to view pasteboard data when the paste feature hasn't [...]<br>

The new logo was first noticed by <em><a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/12/google-icon-update/">9to5Google</a></em>, and while it has the same shape and color palette as the original, there is a gradient that blends each of the colors together instead of the previous color block look.

Google is already using the new logo for the Google Search app on iOS and the Android Google app. Google has not updated its full six character logo with the change to the G logo, as that design does not use blended colors.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a></div><br/>This article, "&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/google-logo-desi [...]<br>

            Although originally written in 2018, the following concepts remain essential for developers working with concurrency. This blogpost focuses on concurrency, distinguishing it from parallelism by defining it as &ldquo;out of order&rdquo; execution. It emphasizes the importance of understanding workload types—CPU bound (e.g., summing, sorting) and IO bound (e.g., file reading)—to assess when concurrency is appropriate. Through practical examples and benchmarks, it shows that parallelism boosts performance for CPU bound tasks, while concurrency alone benefits IO bound workloads.<br>
