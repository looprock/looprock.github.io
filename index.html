            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Not only can you give more direction to the AI when you&rsquo;re playing solo D&amp;D with it, you can start to understand how it thinks. I walk through how to use MCP Server tools to enhance solo roleplaying with Claude (and ChatGPT, etc.) and how to get extra information about how the AI is thinking. Also, I show you how to do logging despite the weird setup Claude Desktop requires.</p>
<p>More generally, you get to see why doing more documentation is important for agentic tools like Model Context Protocol. You have to shift from thinking like a programmer making APIs to thinking like a prompt engineer having a conversation with the AI.</p>
<p>I use Spring AI&rsquo;s Model Context Protocol support to write these tools in Java.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is accelerating its manufacturing shift away from China, with plans to assemble all U.S.-bound iPhones in India by the end of 2026, according to a new <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c2be45b8-cfad-4cbb-9a1a-bfd0626be372">Financial Times</a></em> report.

<br/>
The ambitious timeline would require Apple to double its current iPhone production capacity in India. It marks a major acceleration of Apple's supply chain diversification strategy, which has been gradually expanding in recent years.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently, the majority of iPhones are manufactured in China through partners like Foxconn. The U.S. market accounts for approximately 28 percent of Apple's global iPhone shipments, which totaled 232.1 million units in 2024, according to International Data Corporation.

Threads is migrating from Threads.net to Threads.com, and Threads.com will be the new default domain name.

<br/>
When Threads launched in 2023, Meta did not own Threads.com, so it was located at Threads.net. Meta acquired Threads.com in September 2024, and since then, the Threads.com domain forwarded to Threads.net. Going forward, users who type Threads.net into a browser window will be forwarded to Threads.com.

To accompany the name change, Threads on the web is getting several interface updates to make browsing through posts on the social network easier.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When an iPad running iPadOS 19 is connected to a Magic Keyboard, a macOS-like menu bar will appear on the screen, <a href="https://majinbuofficial.com/ipados-19-and-ios-19-new-features/">according to the leaker Majin Bu</a>.

This change would further blur the lines between the iPad and the Mac. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman previously claimed that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/13/ipados-19-more-like-macos/">iPadOS 19 will be "more like macOS,"</a> with unspecified improvements to productivity, multitasking, and app window management, and the addition of a macOS-like menu bar would certainly align with that overall plan.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdR32VJQ6aE">shared a new ad</a> that highlights a key advantage that iPhone 16 models have over Android smartphones: the Ceramic Shield.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Apple says the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max displays are all protected by the latest-generation Ceramic Shield material, which is advertised as being "2x tougher than glass on any other smartphone."
<br/>
<br/>
In the new "Trust Issues" ad, a father hands his iPhone to a stranger and asks them to take a photo of his family at a carnival. Unfortunately, the stranger drops the iPhone, leading to a moment of suspense given the device might have been damaged. However, the display glass remains intact due to the Ceramic Shield.
<br/>
<br/>
"Relax, it's iPhone 16," the video description concludes.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, your mileage may vary.

            While the so-called "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>" is not expected to launch until September, there are already plenty of rumors about the ultra-thin device.

<br/>
Overall, the iPhone 17 Air sounds like a mixed bag. While the device is expected to have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/22/iphone-17-air-thinness-video/">impressively thin and light design</a>, rumors indicate it will have some compromises compared to iPhone 17 Pro models, including only a single rear camera, a single speaker, and an A19 chip instead of a more powerful A19 Pro chip.

While there have been some concerns that the iPhone 17 Air's thin design could result in limited battery life, the device might end up &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/iphone-17-air-price-bat [...]<br>

In a <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/luXVWtplQ9Bokb">blog post</a> today, the well-known Apple supply chain analyst said that the iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will all be equipped with 12GB of RAM. He previously only expected the iPhone 17 Pro Max to have 12GB of RAM, so this is good news for customers who will be purchasing the other models.
<br/>
<br/>
Kuo said even the base-model iPhone 17 might be equipped with 12GB of RAM, but only if supply chain shortages can be overcome. He said that Apple will make a final decision on the amount of RAM it will offer in this device by May.

            <p>Playing D&amp;D with ChatGPT, Claude, or whatever is fun. But sometime you want more control over how it behaves and what it does. Check out this video for a quick tutorial on creating an oracle plugin for Claude. This &ldquo;plugin&rdquo; is a Model Context Protocol Server written in Java using Spring AI. Once you create the MCP Server, you can hook the oracle into Claude which will use it while you play as a simple yes/no oracle. This is a simple example that will show you how to get everything setup with Java and Spring AI to start making MCP Server tools.
