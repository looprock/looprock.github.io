We first learned of Apple's low-cost MacBook plans in late June, when analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the company was developing a "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-to-launch-low-cost-macbook/">more affordable</a>" 13-inch laptop (the analyst did not mention a price) that would with compete with Chromebooks and drive MacBook purchases.

Kuo said the new MacBook is set to use an A18 Pro chip, which debuted in the iPhone 16 Pro last year. That would make it the first Mac powered by an iPhone chip. So far, all Apple silicon Macs have used M-series chips, which feature more cores, greater memory capacity, and improved external [...]<br>

Apple also continues to test the new Siri with its own apps, he said. Apple's own example was an iPhone user asking Siri about their mother's flight and lunch reservation plans based on info retrieved from the Mail and Messages apps.

When it first announced the new-and-improved Siri at WWDC 2024, Apple said it would have better understanding of a user's personal context, on-screen awareness, and deeper per-app controls, with these features to be powered by Apple Intelligence and an upgraded App Intents system.

<br/>
<br/>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-09 17:33:53-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iPhone 17 models will "likely" be more expensive than iPhone 16 models in the U.S., according to Jeff Pu, an analyst at investment firm GF Securities.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-998158" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/iPhone-17-Pro-on-Desk-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
In a research note this week, Pu attributed the potential iPhone 17 price increases to the U.S. imposing tariffs on products imported from countries where the iPhone is assembled, including China and India. Apple is currently paying a 20% tariff on iPhones imported from China, but none on iPhones imported from India, according <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-iphones-india-trump-tariffs-789c7209">to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>. However, the Trump administration's tariff policies frequently change.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, Apple Music introduces playlist folders, bringing the same organizational power that's long been available for photos and notes to your music collection. Whether you're juggling workout mixes, seasonal soundtracks, or genre-specific selections, folders should be a welcome management tool for your most favored collections.

The feature works exactly as you'd expect – simply create the folder, rename it to suit the intended content, and you'll be navigating your music library with newfound efficiency in no time.
