            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-23 16:07:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Anthropic today said it is updating the Claude chatbot with a new memory feature, which will put Claude on par with ChatGPT. With memory enabled, Claude will be able to recall past conversations.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Anthropic first added memory to Claude earlier this year, but with the initial implementation, Claude would only recall details when specifically asked. In August, Anthropic expanded the memory feature to allow Claude to automatically remember conversation details without a specific user request, and that functionality has been limited to Team and Enterprise subscribers.
<br/>
<br/>
Claude's memory functionality is now expanding to all paid users, so Pro and Max subscribers can use the feature. Max users can turn it on now, while Pro subscribers will get access "over the coming days."
<br/>
<br/>
Memory is an opt-in feature that can be turned on in Claude's settings. There are options for "search and reference chats" and "generate memory from chat history."  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is one of several tech companies that will contribute to the construction of U.S. President Donald Trump's 90,000-square-foot ballroom, reports <em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/ballroom-donors-white-house-trump">CNN</a></em>.

<br/>
Construction began on the ballroom this week, and the White House's east wing was partially torn down. Trump claims that the ballroom will cost $350 million, and that it will be privately funded through donations. The cost has already increased $150 million over the figures that Trump previously quoted.
<br/>
<br/>
Other tech companies that have donated to the ballroom construction include Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and HP.

There is no word on the specific amount that Apple donated toward the project.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Earlier this month, IKEA debuted a tiny NFC-enabled bed that's meant to help smartphone users cut down on nighttime usage. The small "Phone Sleep Collection" is modeled after an actual IKEA bed, and it uses the IKEA app to monitor scroll-free sleep time.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Users who hit seven hours of scroll-free time for a week straight are eligible for an IKEA voucher.
<br/>
<blockquote>Every phone bed comes with built-in NFC tech, making sleep effortlessly rewarding. Here's how it works:
<br/>
- Download the IKEA UAE app.
<br/>
- (For iOS users) When prompted, allow Motion &amp; Fitness tracking.
<br/>
- Place your phone on its bed and tap the notification to open the app.
<br/>
- That's it. Your sleep time will track in the background (no counter will appear).
<br/>
- Complete seven nights of seven-hour sleep, and earn your voucher.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Google Cloud suggests using a centralized proxy to mediate all communication between clients and remote MCP servers. This proxy enforces access control, audit logging, secret policies, and secure transport, helping reduce the attack surface by having one enforced point rather than many decentralized servers. In addition, Google emphasizes identifying particular risk vectors like unauthorized tool exposure, session hijacking, and weak authentication, and treating identity, transport, and policy enforcement as foundational rather than optional.</p>

The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macbook-pro/">M4 MacBook Pro</a> and the M5 ‌MacBook Pro‌ models are identical, and there are no changes to the design. Everything new is inside, and even that's limited.

On Geekbench 6 tests, the M5 ‌MacBook Pro‌ earned a single-core score of 4220 and a multi-core score of 16781, while the ‌M4 MacBook Pro‌ earned [...]<br>
