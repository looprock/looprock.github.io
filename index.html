            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            An in-person Live Translation feature could soon be available on the AirPods, according to imagery found in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> beta 6.

<br/>
There's a picture of the AirPods with Hello in several different languages, along with a suggestion that the feature will be activated with a double press. The file itself is named "Translate," which certainly seems to imply that there will be a gesture to activate a Live Translation option.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            It has been more than three years since Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/08/apple-discontinues-27-inch-imac/">discontinued the 27-inch iMac</a>, as part of its move away from Intel processors. Since then, the 24-inch iMac has been Apple's only all-in-one desktop computer, with no larger model available.

<br/>
Will a larger iMac ever make a comeback? Below, we recap the latest rumors.
<br/>
<br/>
In November 2023, Apple announced that it had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/no-27-inch-with-apple-silicon/">no plans to release a new version of the 27-inch iMac</a> with an Apple silicon chip at that time. Instead, Apple recommended pairing its standalone Studio Display with a Mac Studio or Mac mini. But an even larger iMac could materialize one day, if rumors from the past are still accurate.

            With the sixth beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, Apple has added several new ringtones that are alternatives to the classic "Reflection" ringtone.

In addition to the standard Reflection ringtone, there are now six variants: Buoyant, Dreamer, Tech, Pop, Reflected, and Surge.

Reflected is identical to the "Alt 1" ringtone option that was added back in the second beta of ‌iOS 26‌.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's rumored new more affordable MacBook could have a starting price as low as $599 and launch as soon as this year, according to a new report out of Asia.

<br/>
We first learned of Apple's low-cost MacBook plans in late June, when analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the company was developing a "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-to-launch-low-cost-macbook/">more affordable</a>" 13-inch laptop that would compete with Chromebooks and drive MacBook purchases, though he did not mention pricing. 
<br/>
<br/>
Kuo said the new MacBook is set to use an A18 Pro chip, which debuted in the iPhone 16 Pro last year. That would make it the first Mac powered by an iPhone chip. So far, all Apple silicon Macs have used M-series chips, which feature more cores, greater memory capacity, and improved external display [...]<br>

            Apple is testing a revamped version of Siri with select third-party apps, including Uber, AllTrails, Threads, Temu, Amazon, YouTube, Facebook, WhatsApp, and a few games, according to the latest word from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.

Apple also continues to test the new Siri with its own apps, he said. Apple's own example was an iPhone user asking Siri about their mother's flight and lunch reservation plans based on info retrieved from the Mail and Messages apps.
<br/>
<br/>
When it first announced the new-and-improved Siri at WWDC 2024, Apple said it would have better understanding of a user's personal context, on-screen awareness, and deeper per-app controls, with these features to be powered by Apple Intelligence and an upgraded App Intents system.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            It was long rumored that Apple would release the first MacBook Pro models with OLED displays next year, but that timeframe is a little less certain now.
<br/>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-09 17:33:53-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iPhone 17 models will "likely" be more expensive than iPhone 16 models in the U.S., according to Jeff Pu, an analyst at investment firm GF Securities.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-998158" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/iPhone-17-Pro-on-Desk-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
In a research note this week, Pu attributed the potential iPhone 17 price increases to the U.S. imposing tariffs on products imported from countries where the iPhone is assembled, including China and India. Apple is currently paying a 20% tariff on iPhones imported from China, but none on iPhones imported from India, according <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-iphones-india-trump-tariffs-789c7209">to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>. However, the Trump administration's tariff policies frequently change.
