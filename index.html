Netflix and ESPN also remain in negotiations with MLB officials, the report said.

Apple is now looking to pick up those final three seasons, along with NBC, while ESPN might negotiate a new weekday package.

            In case you missed it — this is the post for people who mainly only read headlines — Apple has announced that it will be releasing iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1 later today. Apple shared this information in a press release on its Newsroom website.

The software updates will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/blood-oxygen-monitoring-returning-to-apple-watch/">re-enable the Blood Oxygen feature</a> on Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Ultra 2 models sold in the United States.
<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear if iOS 18.6.1 will include anything else, such as bug fixes or security patches. Overall, it is likely to be a minor update. Apple is now focused on iOS 26, which is deep into beta testing ahead of a general release in September.
