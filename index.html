            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 26 extended pinned conversations in the Messages app to CarPlay, for quick access to your most frequent chats. However, some drivers may prefer the classic view with a list of individual conversations only, and Apple now lets users choose.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple released the second beta of iOS 26.2 this week, and it introduces a new CarPlay setting for turning off pinned conversations in the Messages app. After installing the beta on your iPhone, simply open the Settings app on CarPlay, look for the Pinned Conversations toggle in the main menu, and turn it off if you prefer to.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26.2 will be released to all users in December, according to Apple.

The hearing follows a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/23/apple-loses-uk-app-store-lawsuit/">decision</a> made in October by the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) saying that Apple unlawfully abused its position in the distribution of iOS apps.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Aqara today launched its latest sensor, debuting the Presence Multi-Sensor FP300. Aqara’s sensor is able to determine when someone is in the room, providing a useful way to control HomeKit-connected lights and devices.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There are dual mmWave and passive infrared sensors inside the FP300, and in our testing prior to launch, the sensors worked well to detect presence and keep lights on even when sitting still.
<br/>
<br/>
A wide 120-degree field of view provides coverage of most of a room depending on where the sensor is located, and Aqara added extra sensors for ambient light, humidity, and temperature. It’s handy to have extra sensors for keeping an eye on room conditions or activating scenes based on parameters like light levels.

<blockquote>
<p>Kubernetes started as a way to orchestrate containers, but its true innovation lies in its API model. The declarative resource pattern, with its desired state, actual state and continuous reconciliation, has proven to be a universal abstraction. It works for workloads, infrastructure, policies and more. That universality is why Kubernetes has become the foundation for IDPs. It provides a consistent way to define, extend and enforce platform building blocks. Whether you’re provisioning a cloud database, managing a network policy or applying compliance rules, Kubernetes APIs make platforms programmable, predictable and composable. This API-first foundation also makes Kubernetes uniquely ready for the AI era. Agents and large language models (LLMs) don’t navigate dashboards or tribal knowledge; they interact with APIs. And Kubernetes offers a consistent, structured interface designed from Day 1 for machine-to-machine communication.”</p>
