            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Deebot X9 Pro Omni is the latest flagship robot vacuum from Ecovacs. <a href="https://www.ecovacs.com/us/deebot-robotic-vacuum-cleaner/deebot-x9-pro-omni">At $1,300</a>, it doesn't come cheap, but it is one of the most full-featured automated vacuuming and mopping options on the market right now.

<br/>
I reviewed the X8 Pro Omni <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/ecovacs-x8-pro-omni-matter/">earlier this year</a>, and I've been using the X9 Pro Omni for over three months now. For something this expensive, I wanted to make sure that I extensively tested it before sharing an opinion. The X9 Pro Omni is a Matter-enabled robot vacuum, so it connects to the Apple Home app. It can be controlled with the Home app, the Ecovacs app, or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> voice commands.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iOS 26 update, currently in beta, introduces a striking visual overhaul with its new Liquid Glass design language. However, if the translucent elements are causing readability issues or you simply prefer a more opaque interface, there's a quick accessibility setting that can help tone things down.

<br/>
The Liquid Glass design brings transparency effects throughout the system interface and stock apps. On the Home Screen, you'll notice the search bar, dock, and app folders all feature translucent backgrounds. App icons themselves now sport a new layered glass appearance that adds visual depth and dimension to your device – plus there's a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-make-app-icons-clear-iphone-home-screen/">Clear appearance</a> option that ups the ante even more.

            In this post, we explore how CommSec, Australia's leading online broker, transitioned from a multicloud environment to AWS as their sole cloud provider while implementing Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC) zonal shift to maintain high availability and operational resilience. The consolidation resulted in significant benefits including 25% base capacity reduction, two times faster deployments, and improved failover capabilities through ARC zonal shift, enabling CommSec to continue serving millions of customers while meeting strict regulatory requirements.<br>

Of particular interest is how truthful (and therefore reliable) LLM-generated answers turn out to be in the context of Etsy-specific question answering. Among other insights, we find that asking the LLM to identify specific source snippets is a good way to flag potential hallucinations.</em></p>
