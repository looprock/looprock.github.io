            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Google Maps has gained the optional ability to scan screenshots in your iPhone's photos and save any found locations to a dedicated list.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="google maps" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1000948" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/google-maps-save-screenshots.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
Powered by the company's Gemini AI, the new feature lets Google Maps search for any screenshots in your photos, such as social media posts, news articles, and travel blogs, and capture them in the app under a new Screenshots List under the You tab.
<br/>
<br/>
The feature scans for shots that include location information like names and addresses, and the app finds associated listings in Google Maps. Users can review those captures via a carousel, and Gemini will automatically identify the associated places and offer to save them with additional details. 
<br/>

The feature's Auto-scan option requires that Google Maps is given the "Allow Access to All Photos [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>

Cue's comments, made during the ongoing U.S. Justice Department antitrust lawsuit against Google, triggered a 7.51% drop in Google's stock price on Wednesday.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S25 lineup back in January, it teased a "one more thing" announcement, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge/">introduced a super thin Galaxy Edge smartphone</a> slated for release later in the year. The Galaxy Edge is now closer to launching, and Samsung is planning an official debut event <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/beyond-slim-discover-unprecedented-innovation-with-galaxy-s25-edge">on Monday, May 12</a> at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time (or May 13 at 9:00 a.m., for those in South Korea).

Samsung showed off some limited pictures of the Galaxy Edge earlier this year, and it will be notably thinner than Samsung's current S25 lineup. It won't be as expensive as the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but it will have the same flagship features as the rest of the S25 lineup, suggesting it is a mid-tier device much like Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17</a> [...]<br>

Netflix has been testing a redesigned version of its TV app <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/netflix-tv-app-redesign/">since last year</a>, and the new look is a notable departure from the current design.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
There is a new home page that has a streamlined, modern design, and Netflix designed it to put content front and center. Shows are organized into different categories as they are now, but each section will feature a large main card that has information like release date and show or movie description. Navigating through each show will display the same information for other content in the section, without the need to click in to a show to get more details.

            It's been nearly two months since the M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> launched, so we thought we'd take another look at the machine now that it's been out long enough to do some serious testing with it.

<br/>
Introduced in March, the ‌MacBook Air‌ is equipped with Apple's latest and greatest M4 chip, so it's more than capable of handling day-to-day tasks from web browsing and watching videos to getting work done. It's even powerful enough for photo editing and some light video editing work.

<br/>
All Macs have a minimum of 16GB RAM now, so the base M4 ‌MacBook Air‌ that starts at $999 is a really good deal for what you get. You can upgrade the RAM and the SSD, which may be worthwhile depending on what you want to do on your Mac.
