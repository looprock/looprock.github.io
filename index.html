            iMessage for Android app Beeper Mini is once again having connectivity issues, which it has attributed to Apple. Last night, Beeper Mini <a href="https://twitter.com/onbeeper/status/1735127340357918874">stopped working</a> for some people, and the company confirmed that Apple was "deliberately blocking iMessages from being delivered" to approximately five percent of Beeper Mini users.

In terms of size, the Walden frame is 15.7 inches long, 12.7 inches tall, and 1.2 inches in depth, so it's a little bit thicker than your average photo frame.  [...]<br>

In a slide (via <em>SemiAnalysis</em>'s <a href="https://x.com/dylan522p/status/1734766944774193291?s=20">Dylan Patel</a>) from its Future of Logic panel, TSMC disclosed the official name of its 1.4nm node for the first time, "A14."

<br/>
N2 is scheduled for mass production in late 2025, to be followed by an enhanced "N2P" node in late 2026. As a result, it is unlikely that any A14 chips will arrive before 2027.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-12-14 05:53:54-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple in iOS 17 added inline predictive text for iPhones, but did not include a way to turn it off independently of predictive suggestions above the keyboard. In the latest iOS 17.2 update, that's changed. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926577" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/inline-predictive-text.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
Apple has improved its machine learning technology on iPhones in an effort to make iOS a lot more helpful, and one of the features in which this tech has been deployed is inline predictive text. 
<br/>
<br/>
Predictive text does just what it says - it predicts what you're going to type next, and offers to autocomplete it. As you type, the predicted text appears ahead of the cursor. If it has accurately predicted what you intend to type, all you need to do is tap the spacebar and iOS fills it in for you.
