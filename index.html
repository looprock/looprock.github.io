In the video, a man flexes his muscles in front of a mirror, while a woman takes photos of him with an iPhone. Later, the man realizes that the woman is visible in the mirror in the background of the photos, so he uses the Clean Up tool to remove her. The ad emphasizes the ease of using the feature, but in reality it does not always work perfectly.

Clean Up is an Apple Intelligence feature, meaning that it is only available on the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, or any iPhone 16 model.

They’re also an issue for developers using AI-based tools when building code, including generating names of packages [&#8230;]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When U.S. President Donald Trump levied 145 percent tariffs on goods imported from China, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> started working to score Apple an exemption that would keep <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> costs down.

<br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/04/17/apple-iphone-tariff-exemption-trump/">The Washington Post</a></em>, Cook had a phone call with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick last week, explaining how the tariffs would cause ‌iPhone‌ prices to increase. He talked to senior White House officials about the tariffs, and made sure not to say anything negative in public about Trump's policies that would anger Trump. For Trump's inauguration, Cook also personally donated $1 million.

            Google has an illegal monopoly in online advertising, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema said today. Google is guilty of "willfully acquiring and maintaining monopoly power" in the publisher ad server market that websites use for ads and the open-web display ad exchange market that matches advertisers with websites.
