            Apple will introduce four new iPhones next week, and the standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> will arguably be the least interesting of the bunch. It's not going to get the super slim design like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>, nor will it have the upgraded camera setup like the 17 Pro. There are still a handful of features to look forward to, though, which we've outlined below.

The upcoming device, which he refers to as the "Vision Air," will supposedly be over 40 percent lighter than the current model. The Vision Pro weighs in at round 1.375 pounds, so a version that's 40 percent lighter should come in at under a pound.

Kuo also says the Vision Air will be over 50 percent cheaper, which could make it much more attractive to prospective buyers. The Vision Pro costs $3,499, which means a half-priced version would be $1,750.
