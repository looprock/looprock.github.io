The summarizing it does it good too.</p><p>I’ve done many more, including &lt;a href="https://newsletter.cote.io/p/deep-dive-five-years-of-s</p> [...]<br>

            <h4>The Two Billion Claps Bug</h4><h3>TL;DR</h3><p>A user was able to exploit a race condition in our backend system to manipulate clap counts on posts. Users are supposed to only be able to clap between 0 and 50 times for a given post, but this hack allowed them to go outside those bounds (both above and below). Our fix leverages <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.ConditionExpressions.html">DynamoDB condition expressions</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadConsistency.html">strongly consistent reads</a> to block updates on data that have been manipulated after a read, but before a write. Additionally, we implemented an eventually consistent clap rectification solution for those posts that were already affected by this bug.</p><h3>Catching The Bug</h3><p>We became aware of this problem thanks to a user who brought an extremely detailed writeup of a roundabout way to manipulate claps. We appreciate t</p> [...]<br>

            Despite being released over two years ago, Apple's AirPods Pro 2 continue to dominate the wireless earbud market. However, with the AirPods Pro 3 expected to launch sometime in 2025, anyone thinking of buying Apple's premium earbuds may be wondering if the next generation is worth holding out for.

<br/>
Apart from their audio and noise-canceling performance, which are generally regarded as excellent for such small buds, one of the reasons the AirPods Pro 2 have remained popular is Apple's commitment to updating their feature set with software updates. 
<br/>
<br/>
When iOS 17 was released last year, AirPods Pro 2 got new Adaptive Audio features, mute controls, and faster automatic device switching. And with iOS 18, released last month, Apple added <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-airpods-pro/">head gestures&lt;/</a> [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-10-01 04:57:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When you shoot video on iPhone 16 models, multiple formats like Spatial Audio and Stereo are recorded to allow more audio customization. If you record video with Spatial Audio turned on, you can later edit the video sound — to reduce background noise to focus on the person speaking on camera, for example.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-967656" height="898" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/audio-mix-iphone-16.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
Spatial Audio is automatically enabled on all iPhone 16 models when you record video. Spatial Audio produces a more realistic and immersive audio recording, but it also allows you to edit the sound of your video later in the Photos app using the new Audio Mix feature.
<br/>
<br/>
Audio Mix uses machine learning to identify and separate background audio and speech, allowing you to choose one of the following options to remix your video's sound:

            Apple's budget-friendly iPhone SE is set for a major overhaul with a fourth generation model expected to launch in spring 2025. The upcoming model will mark a significant departure from its predecessors, adopting several features from higher-end iPhones while maintaining its position as the most affordable new model in Apple's lineup.

            Verizon is currently experiencing a major outage that is affecting many customers across the U.S., including iPhone users. Affected users may be unable to send or receive phone calls, send or receive text messages, or use cellular data.
<br/>
<br/>

As a result of the network being down, many affected iPhone users are seeing "SOS" displayed in their device's status bar. In a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120000">support document</a>, Apple says that an iPhone displays "SOS" when the device is not connected to a network, but it should still be possible to make emergency calls in the U.S., Australia, and Canada.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iOS 18 update brings powerful new search functions to the Photos app, allowing you to find specific images with unprecedented precision. Here's how to make the most of its new capabilities.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961382" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-Photos-Feature-Chromatic.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
In iOS 18, the key to effective searching in Photos is using natural language. Instead of simple keywords, try describing the photo you're looking for in detail. The app can now understand complex queries and find images based on specific elements within them.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you've previously identified friends and family using the People and Pets features, you can search for "Dad smiling" or "Snowy sleeping." The more specific you are, the better your results will be. You can even search for actions or emotions, like "kids laughing at swings" or "couple dancing at wedding."

Apple is believed to have initially set aside $1 billion annually to produce big-budget films for cinemas, aiming to compete with traditional Hollywood studios.

Apple last week removed the iPhone apps for Beddit models 3.0 and 3.5 from the App Store, according to <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/">Aaron Perris</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/05/09/apple-acquires-sleep-monitor-beddit/">acquired Beddit in 2017</a>, and it has gradually reduced hardware and software capabilities and support for the accessory since. Apple removed cloud syncing from the original Beddit app in 2018, released an updated version of the accessory <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/apple-beddit-3-5-sleep-monitor/">with fewer features</a> in 2019, and stopped selling the accessory entirely in 2022.

Apple had been in discussions to participate in a funding round for OpenAI that is expected to raise approximately $6.5 billion. However, Apple recently dropped out of the talks for reasons that remain unclear. The funding round is set to close this week.

            Apple last week released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a>, and one version of the new earbuds has Active Noise Cancellation included. ANC means the ‌AirPods 4‌ have a feature set that rivals the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2, so we thought we'd compare the two for those undecided on which to get.

The ‌AirPods 4‌ are Apple's first open-ear earbuds to include ANC, and the major difference between the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 and the ‌AirPods 4‌ is the silicone tips. The ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 have silicone tips for a tighter seal in the ear, while the ‌AirPods 4‌ don't.
