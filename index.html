            <h1>Consumer-grade Chat Gen-AI Churn Update</h1><p>Overall, the generative AI things have been a disappointment for me. For writing, they seem helpful for generating and starting content, but it ends up being more work to fix and, then, rewrite what they do. Over the years, people have ghostwritten things for me. Like, humans! I’d too often have to (<em>want to</em>) go through and inject my voice and style, and also add play around with the core ideas. Now, when “byline” opportunities like this come up, I write just write it all myself. </p><p>Using AI for writing is like that. It’s sort of good for bouncing off ideas.</p><p>And summarizing text is hit or miss. First, it can’t always retrieve web pages. I mean, I get it with people not wanting to give their content to Evil Nerds and stuff. But the result is that <em>I</em> don’t get what I want: a faster way to read text.<a class="footnote-anchor" href="https://cote.io/feed.xml#footnote-1" id="footnote-anchor-1" target="_self">1</a> The summaries are “fine,”</p> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, Apple has added a new "Keep Downloaded" option when browsing items in iCloud, allowing users to designate which files and folders should remain permanently available locally on their device.
<br/>

<br/>
In previous versions of iOS and macOS, users had limited control over which files and folders were kept offline. iCloud's automatic management system would offload files from the device to free up space, potentially removing files that you might want to keep available at all times. 
<br/>
<br/>
Apple offered no straightforward way to prevent this – until now. In macOS Sequoia, when browsing iCloud Drive in Finder, right-clicking a file or folder reveals the new "Keep Downloaded" option. When enabled, the cloud symbol next to the item is opaque instead of transparent, indicating that it wi [...]<br>

<br/>
The site claims that the renders are of a "larger" model featuring a 2-inch display. The current Apple Watch Series 9 has a 1.7-inch display, while the Apple Watch Ultra has a display size of 1.93-inches, so this would be the biggest screen on an Apple Watch so far.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>

The speaker got an upgrade in 2015 with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2015/10/07/apple-debuts-beats-pill-plus-speaker/">launch of the Pill+</a> under Apple's ownership, but over time it appeared to become an afterthought for Beats compared to headphones and earphones, and the Pill+ was eventually <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/10/beats-pill-discontinued/">discontinued in early 2022</a>.
