In the dark ages before TikTok and Instagram entertained us with duck lips and alphabet luxury brands wearing peacocks, car rides used to be very boring – at least for me. I got car sick when reading, so my many five-to-six hour journeys between Buffalo, New York and Detroit, Michigan were bone-crushingly boring. I listened to a lot of banal radio.

Both the MagSafe Battery Pack and MagSafe Duo Charger were equipped with a Lightning port, so it is not too surprising that they were discontinued after Apple introduced four new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-iphone-15-and-15-plus/">iPhone 15 models with USB-C ports</a>.

Apple did not change the price of the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌, and it is still priced starting at $999 for 128GB of storage. 
<br/>
<br/>
The ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max is priced starting at $1,199, but that's only because Apple has eliminated the 128GB storage tier for that device. It now starts at 256GB, and $1,199 is the same price Apple charged for the 256GB <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a> Max.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-09-12 12:54:51-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            While the new standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are equipped with a USB-C port, data transfer over a cable remains limited to USB 2.0 speeds of up to 480 Mbps, which is equal to the Lightning port on previous iPhones. Apple confirmed this detail in its tech specs for the devices posted on the company's website.

<br/>
The higher-end iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are also equipped with a USB-C port, but those devices support USB 3 data transfer speeds of up to 10 Gbps over a cable. Unlike recent iPad Pro models, this means that the Pro models unfortunately do not support Thunderbolt, which theoretically supports speeds up to 40 Gbps.
<br/>
<br/>

On December 5th, 2022, I deactivated my Instagram, Facebook (you'll still see my account as I am selling some things on Marketplace, lol), and Twitter accounts.</p>
<p>\
Two years ago, I underwent an experiment in which I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEIypZw8zQs">quit social media for two months</a>. This time, I doubled the ante.</p>
<p>\
I have stopped participating in Reddit (which was difficult for me because it was the default place I would go to scroll). I do believe that there is a benefit to Reddit, but with ChatGPT, I have been using that far more for programming stuff. Reddit is still my go for opinions on various topics, but far less so than even a year ago.</p>
<p>\
YouTube has been severely limited by removing most of my subscriptions and using an RSS reader to see when new videos are out (taking the thumbnail and clickbait out of the equation).</p>
