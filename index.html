            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If you have an old Apple Watch and you're not sure what to do with it, a new product called <a href="https://thetinypod.com">TinyPod</a> might be the answer. Priced at $79, the TinyPod is a silicone case with a built-in scroll wheel that houses the Apple Watch chassis.

<br/>
When an Apple Watch is placed inside the TinyPod, the click wheel on the case is able to be used to scroll through the Apple Watch interface. The feature works through "carefully mechanized components" that make direct contact with the Digital Crown on Apple Watch.

The TinyPod website suggests that a cellular version of the Apple Watch could be placed inside the TinyPod and used as a miniature phone, without the need to carry an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. The case leaves the back of the Apple Watch exposed [...]<br>

            With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, Apple added some useful iPad-specific features in the Notes app, including Smart Script and Math Notes. Both of these additions are designed to work with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>, and they're some of the neater new features on Apple's tablets. Apple product manager Ty Jordan and engineering manager Jenny Chen recently did an interview with Chris Lawley to discuss the work that went into the ‌iPadOS 18‌ updates.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Smart Script is one of the ways that Apple is using machine learning in ‌iPadOS 18‌. It refines handwritten text, making your handwriting look neater without losing the personal flare that makes it <em>your</em> handwriting rather than generic writing. Smart Script learns your handwriting style, which Jordan said makes it as useful as typed text.
