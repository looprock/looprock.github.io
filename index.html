            <b>Published:</b> 2025-07-16 20:35:46-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The AirPods market appears to be flatlining in the United States, but the launch of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a> later this year could boost sales, a new report claims.

<br/>
According to a <a href="https://cirpapple.substack.com/p/airpods-succeed-yet-need-to-succeed">new report</a> from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP), approximately 44% of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owners in the United States now report owning Bluetooth earbuds, up from 41% in the previous year. Of those, 59% say they use AirPods. This represents a small gain from 57% the year before, effectively bringing the figure back to its 2023 level. This means AirPods are used by roughly 26% of all ‌iPhone‌ owners in the United States today.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/08/iphone-17-air-dummy-model-video/">iPhone 17 Air</a> will have a titanium frame, according to Apple analyst Jeff Pu.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010921" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iPhone-17-Air-Thumb-2-Blue-Electric-Boogaloo.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
In an investor note with equity research firm GF Securities this week, Pu also said the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will have aluminum frames, so the iPhone 17 Air will apparently be the only new model to use titanium.
<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear why the iPhone 17 Air would have a titanium frame, as aluminum is lighter than titanium, which would be fitting for the device's rumored ultra-thin and lightweight design. Titanium is generally stronger than aluminum, however, so perhaps the material is necessary to ensure that the iPhone 17 Air's thin chassis is durable.

<br/>
Sleep apnea is a disorder where a person's breathing repeatedly stops and starts again during sleep, preventing rest. Sleep apnea detection on Apple Watch uses the device's accelerometer to monitor tiny movements at the wrist that are linked with interruptions in respiratory patterns. Disturbances that occur multiple times over several nights can indicate sleep apnea.
