            For decades, the FCC has maintained an arguably pathetic definition of “broadband,” allowing the telecom industry to under-deliver substandard access. After some industry lobbying to ensure it wasn&#8217;t too stringent, the agency is finally getting around to an update, and has announced that they&#8217;ll soon classify &#8220;broadband&#8221; as anything faster than 100 Mbps downstream, 20 [&#8230;]<br>

<blockquote>"There are things that we take a keen interest in, for instance, if the new Apple fee structure will de facto not make it in any way attractive to use the benefits of the DMA. That kind of thing is what we will be investigating," </blockquote> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple plans to maximize the display size on the upcoming iPhone 16 series by using a new ultra-thin bezel technology, claims a new report out of Korea. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927877" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPhone-16-Pro-Sizes-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.sisajournal-e.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=401354">Sisa Journal</a></em>, Apple will use Border Reduction Structure (BRS) technology to minimize the bezel at the bottom of the display. BRS achieves this by rolling up the internal copper wiring into a more compact package.

<br/>
Apple reportedly plans to apply the borderless display technology to all four iPhone 16 models, which are due to be released in the second half of this year.

The company is said to have attempted to apply the technology to iPhones before, but previous attempts were curtailed due to heat issues. Apple's reinvigorated efforts to a [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's latest ad for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models focuses on the device's storage, highlighting the 128GB of available storage space for the entry-level device.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The ad features a man looking through his photos, and each photo on the device sings "Don't Let Go" by Terrace Martin, Mr. Talkbox, and PJ Morton. He ultimately decides not to delete his images. The spot ends with the tagline "Lots of storage for lots of photos."

Far from just a title and description, a price and a few images, over the years the listing screen has come to aggregate ratings and reviews, seller and shipping and stock information, and gained a variety of personalization and recommendation features. As information-rich as it is, as central as it is to the buying experience, for product teams the listing screen is an irresistible place to test out new methods and approaches. In just the last three years, apps teams have run nearly 200 experiments on it, often with multiple teams building and running experiments in parallel.</p>
