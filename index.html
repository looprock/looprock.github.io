            <b>Published:</b> 2023-08-30 14:41:20+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>\
Module Design Pattern is a way to encapsulate and organize code in a self-containing module that can expose certain functionalities while keeping the rest of the code private.</p>
<p>\
This helps prevent variable and function name clashes, improves code maintainability, and promotes the concept of separation of concerns.</p>
<p>\
Here's an example of how you can implement the Module Design Pattern in JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code>// Module using the Module Design Pattern
var Module = (function() {
  // Private variable
  var privateVariable = "I am a private variable";

  // Private function
  var privateFunction = function privateFunction() {
    console.log("This is a private function");
  }

  // Public function
  var publicFunction = function() {
      console.log("This is a public function");
  }
  // Public interface
  return {
    publicFunction:publicFunction,
    // Public variable accessing private variable
    publicVariable: privateVariable
  };
})();

// Usage of the module
