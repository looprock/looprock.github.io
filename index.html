            Following the Apple Card savings account's recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/apple-card-savings-account-apr-increase/">rate increase to 4.35%</a>, we have put together this guide comparing the annual percentage yields (APYs) of some popular high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs) available to U.S. residents.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Apple's rate now matches that of popular HYSAs offered by the likes of American Express, Capital One, and Discover, but there are a handful of other options that offer even higher APYs in the 4.5% to low 5% range, such as Marcus by Goldman Sachs and Wealthfront. Balance limits and other requirements vary.

<br/>
There are many other HYSAs not listed in our chart, so be sure to do your research before deciding which option is best suited for you.

            Apple will be reopening its <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/baystreet/">Bay Street retail store</a> in Emeryville, California on Monday, January 8 at 10 a.m. local time, according to the company's website.

The store had been closed for renovations since early September, according to <a href="https://michaelsteeber.substack.com/p/clearing-the-table"><em>Tabletops</em></a>, a weekly newsletter about Apple retail published by <a href="https://departmentmap.store/">Michael Steeber</a>.

<br/>
<br/>
The store originally opened in 2002, becoming Apple's 50th retail location in the U.S., and moved to its current location on Bay Street in 2016.
