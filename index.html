            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-26 04:08:53-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WhatsApp is making it easier to catch up on conversations you've missed with a new AI-powered feature that summarizes unread messages. The Meta-owned messaging app now lets users tap on unread message counts to "Summarize privately" and get quick, bulleted summaries generated by Meta AI instead of scrolling through every individual message.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1008245" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/whatsapp-message-ai-summaries.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
The feature uses Meta's "Private Processing" technology, which the company <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/catch-up-on-conversations-with-private-message-summaries">claims</a> keeps your messages and summaries completely private – even Meta and WhatsApp staff can't see them. Other chat participants won't know you've used the summary feature either.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            A new rumor today surfaced about Apple's book-style foldable iPhone, set to be released next year, and this time it's about the cameras.

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1008228" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/foldable-iphone-mockup.jpg" width="1920"/><div class="center-wrap"><em>Mockup of foldable iPhone in its unfolded state (Image: Digital Chat Station)</em></div>

In a previous report, industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said he expects the foldable iPhone (or "iPhone Fold" for short) to include a <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f">dual-lens rear camera</a>, but Kuo provided no other specifics. Now, prolific Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PyjLapQqg">Digital Chat Station</a> claims that those dual lenses will be 48 megapixels each.

            If you own an iPhone or iPad with a USB-C port, the port can be used to charge AirPods, an Apple Watch, or even another iPhone, which is handy for times when you don't have a spare charger or power outlet available. Here's how it works.
<br/>

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910412" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-USB-C-Port-Event-Still.jpg" width="1600"/>

If your AirPods or Apple Watch run out of battery while you don't have access to a charger, you can use the battery in your iPhone or iPad for a little extra juice rather than carrying around an additional battery pack.

Additionally, if you plug an ‌iPhone 15‌ or newer into another ‌iPhone 15‌ or newer, the two devices will communicate with one another, determine which ‌iPhone‌ has the lower battery, and transfer power in the direction that needs it most.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-25 04:21:51-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is expected to release new iPad Pro models powered by its latest M5 chip later this year, and both Samsung Display and LG Display have reportedly begun mass production of the devices' OLED panels in preparation.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
For last year's iPad Pro models which debuted OLED displays, Samsung handled supply for the 11-inch panels, while LG dealt with the 13-inch panels. This year, <em>ZDNet Korea</em> reports that the two manufacturers will share supply for both panel sizes, likely as a result of Apple's efforts to diversify its supply chain.
<br/>
<br/>
The change is also likely related to Apple's need to deepen OLED adoption across its suppliers. Reports suggest plans to introduce OLED panels for the iPad mini in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/2026-ipad-air-oled-panels-supplied-samsung/">2026</a> and the iPad Air [...]<br>
