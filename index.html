<br/>
<br/>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-22 04:01:56-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is no longer signing iOS 18.6, making downgrades from iOS 18.6.2 or iOS 18.6.1 to iOS 18.6 impossible. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/apple-releases-ios-18-6-1/">iOS 18.6.1</a> was released a little over a week ago, swiftly followed by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/20/apple-releases-ios-18-6-2-with-security-fixes/">iOS 18.6.2</a> on Wednesday.

<br/>
Apple often stops signing an older version of iOS, usually within a week or two after a new version is released. When an update is no longer signed, it can't be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side software verification check.
<br/>
<br/>
By no longer signing a software version, Apple ensures that customers have the latest security improvements and are not vulnerable to known attacks.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-22 03:41:46-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            An established Chinese leaker has pushed back against recent rumors suggesting Apple plans to eliminate the Camera Control button from the iPhone 18, instead claiming the company is working to simplify the component to reduce costs.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964713" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-capture-button.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
According to Weibo leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/Q11QMAvPN">Instant Digital</a>, the Camera Control's pressure-sensitive modules for the iPhone 18 series currently remain in trial production. However, Apple is reportedly removing the capacitive sensor from the current dual-sensor design, and opting instead to rely solely on pressure sensing to achieve all button functions.
<br/>
<br/>
The current Camera Control button on iPhone 16 models uses both capacitive and pressure sensors beneath a sapphire crystal surface. The capacitive layer detects touch gestures, while the forc [...]<br>

Chu was involved with managing Apple's cloud-based large language models (LLMs), and was also influential in developing search features for Siri and Apple's entertainment services. For Meta, Chu will work on a new team called MSL Infra, responsible for AI infrastructure development.

            The Deebot X9 Pro Omni is the latest flagship robot vacuum from Ecovacs. <a href="https://www.ecovacs.com/us/deebot-robotic-vacuum-cleaner/deebot-x9-pro-omni">At $1,300</a>, it doesn't come cheap, but it is one of the most full-featured automated vacuuming and mopping options on the market right now.

I reviewed the X8 Pro Omni <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/ecovacs-x8-pro-omni-matter/">earlier this year</a>, and I've been using the X9 Pro Omni for over three months now. For something this expensive, I wanted to make sure that I extensively tested it before sharing an opinion. The X9 Pro Omni is a Matter-enabled robot vacuum, so it connects to the Apple Home app. It can be controlled with the Home app, the Ecovacs app, or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> voice commands.

            Apple's iOS 26 update, currently in beta, introduces a striking visual overhaul with its new Liquid Glass design language.

The Liquid Glass design brings transparency effects throughout the system interface and stock apps.

Perhaps getting started quickly like this is easy for me because I’ve listened to myself and others podcast for 20 years. Maybe it will work for you.</p><p>If you have a presentation already, that is likely a good structure. Go slide by slide and write out what you would say for each slide.</p><p>Setup a “dead pool” document for text you delete.

The consolidation resulted in significant benefits including 25% base capacity reduction, two times faster deployments, and improved failover capabilities through ARC zonal shift, enabling CommSec to continue serving millions of customers while meeting strict regulatory requirements.<br>
