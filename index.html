            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is surveying its employees about smart glasses as it continues to consider releasing its own version of Meta's Ray-Ban glasses, reports <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/01/meta-ray-bans-ai-training/">Bloomberg</a></em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>. Apple has launched an internal study of products that are on the market, and is currently gathering feedback from Apple employees.

In an email sent out to employees, Apple's Product Systems Quality team called for participants for "an upcoming user study with current market smart glasses." According to Gurman, it is common for Apple to use focus groups when it is deciding on whether to enter a new market. Using employees for the focus groups allows Apple to keep its plans secret, something that wouldn't be po [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today stopped signing iOS 18.0.1, preventing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users who have upgraded to iOS 18.1 from downgrading to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-releases-ios-18-1/">released iOS 18.1</a> a week ago on October 28.

<br/>
It is not unusual for Apple to stop signing older versions of iOS shortly after a new version of iOS is released. When Apple stops signing an update, it can no longer be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side software verification check that happens before new software is installed, so those who have upgraded to the latest version of ‌iOS 18‌ cannot downgrade to iOS 18.0.1.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iPadOS is now under formal scrutiny by the European Commission to determine whether it complies with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA).
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-949489" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/Apple-Pencil-Pro-Newsroom.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
The announcement by the European Commission marks the next step in its regulatory oversight of Apple, following the iPadOS designation as a "gatekeeper" platform in April 2024. The classification was part of a broader effort to apply the newly enforced DMA, aimed at limiting the dominance of major tech firms and promoting fair competition across the European Union.
<br/>
<br/>
The regulations outline obligations for "gatekeepers," mandating these companies to open up their software ecosystems to ensure a level playing field.

            If you're concerned about hearing loss and own AirPods Pro 2, Apple in iOS 18.1 offers a convenient new clinical-grade hearing test that's easy to use. Here's everything you need to know about checking your hearing health with this new feature.

Note that Apple's Hearing Test feature is not available in all regions, likely due to differing regulatory laws.
