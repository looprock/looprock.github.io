            Award-winning iPhone camera app <a href="https://halide.cam">Halide</a> was today updated to version 2.15, which includes a new feature that allows users to take photos devoid of all image processing for a more natural look.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Halide's new image processing pipeline is called "<a href="http://www.lux.camera/introducing-process-zero-for-iphone/">Process Zero</a>," which uses "zero AI, no computational photography whatsoever – offering photographers a counter to the increasingly AI-heavy processing and tooling on smartphones," according to app developer Lux Optics.

<br/>
Process Zero uses a fast process based on a single exposure RAW file. The file itself is a 12 megapixel image plus a RAW DNG file for additional editing.

            Sessions, Where Everything Started For the past few years, Yelp has been using dbt as one of the tools to develop data products that power data marts, which are one stop shops for high visibility dashboards pertaining to top level business metrics. One of the key data products that’s owned by my team, Clickstream Analytics, is the Sessions Data Mart. This product is our in-house solution to understand what consumers do during their session interaction with Yelp products and provide insights on top of it.

Here’s three examples of approaches I’ve come across recently.</em></p><p>You’re trying to convince your organization to put an app platform in place (probably either buying one or building one on-top of Kubernetes), to shift your ops team to platform engineering (just after HR finally changed titles from “Systems Analyst II” to “DevOps Engineer”!), or, if you’re like me, sell people a platform.</p><h1><strong>ROI</strong></h1><p>“Yeah, but what’s the ROI for it?” the Director of No responds. What they mean by that is “convince me that this change is going to have benefits that we can represent as money, either saved or gained.” A variation is “show me that what you’re proposing is cheaper than the alternatives, including the alternative of doing nothing.” That’s probably more of a “Total Cost of Ownership” (TCO) analysis. Indeed, ROI and TCO models are often used the same way, if not the same spreadsheets. This kind of analysis is also often c</p> [...]<br>
