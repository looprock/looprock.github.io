            Sonos has ended work on a high-end streaming set-top box that was expected to launch sometime in 2025, reports <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/628297/sonos-pinewood-streaming-box-canceled">The Verge</a></em>. Sonos informed employees of the streaming box's cancelation in a meeting today, and has reassigned those that were working on the product to other teams.

The set-top box was supposed to be Sonos' major product for the second half of 2025, and Sonos spent considerable resources on it. It was almost completed, and was even beta tested for months, but interim CEO Tom Conrad has decided to reprioritize Sonos' roadmap, and a push into video is no longer happening at the current time.

            The new Mac Studio models with M4 Max and M3 Ultra chips support Low Power Mode, according to an <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/101613">Apple support document</a> updated today.

<br/>
Apple says turning on Low Power Mode reduces the Mac Studio's fan noise, which is useful for tasks that require a quieter environment, and it also allows for reduced power consumption if the computer is left running continuously.
<br/>
<br/>
The reduced fan noise aspect of Low Power Mode requires macOS Sequoia 15.1 or later. The new Mac Studio ships with macOS Sequoia 15.3.

If you've seen the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> or M3 ‌MacBook Air‌ models, then you know exactly what the M4 version looks like. Apple didn't change the design one bit, though there is a new Sky Blue color that replaces Space Gray. It's a subtle blue that doesn't even look blue depending on the lighting, so it's not the most exciting update.

What's new is inside, and it's primarily the M4 chip. The M4 chip is Apple's latest, and you don't need us to tell you that it's fast. CPU performance is up to 30  [...]<br>

In a subscriber-only post shared on X last month, Young said the new Studio Display will feature the same 27-inch screen size as the current model, but add mini-LED backlighting. This upgrade would result in increased brightness and higher contrast ratio compared to the current model, which has traditional LED backlighting.

Young did not share any further details, so it is unclear if any other Studio Display specifications would change, such as the refresh rate.

Specifically, CarPlay now shows a third row of icons, up from two rows previously. However, this change is only visible in vehicles with a larger center display.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's new M4 MacBook Air is now being delivered to customers worldwide following the pre-order period that began on March 5. The same goes for Apple's new versions of the iPad, iPad Air, and Mac Studio. For those who didn't pre-order or chose to wait, the new models are currently readily available, and select Apple Store locations globally are offering same-day or next-day pickup options.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is expected to replace the iPhone "Plus" model in its upcoming iPhone 17 lineup with an all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air, and so a lot of the rumors about the device have naturally concerned its thickness. Today, we may have learned one more detail in that regard.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993585" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iPhone-17-Air-Size-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
<em>The Information</em> has said the iPhone 17 Air will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/iphone-17-air-features-reported/">around 6mm thick</a>, while Jeff Pu thinks it will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/18/iphone-17-air-could-be-thinnest-iphone-ever/">6mm thick</a>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models will utilize vapor chamber cooling technology to improve thermal performance, according to the Chinese leaker known as <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/PibBvE4I7">Instant Digital</a>.

<br/>
Vapor chamber technology is already common in many premium Android smartphones. By dispersing heat across a larger surface area, it helps prevent thermal throttling and keeps performance stable, which is a major advantage in thinner, more compact devices.
<br/>
<br/>
This isn't the first time we have heard rumors about Apple's use of vapour chamber heatsinks in the iPhone 17 series. In January, Chinese tech news site <em>MyDrivers</em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/iphone-17-major-thermal-upgrade/">claimed</a> that the entire iPhone 17 lineup, including the regular iPhone 17,  [...]<br>
