            In select U.S. states, residents can <a href="https://learn.wallet.apple/id">add their driver's license or state ID to the Wallet app</a> on the iPhone and Apple Watch, providing a convenient and contactless way to display proof of identity or age at select airports and businesses, and in select apps.

<br/>
Unfortunately, this feature continues to roll out very slowly since it was announced in 2021, with only nine U.S. states and Puerto Rico offering it so far.
<br/>
<br/>
During its WWDC 2025 keynote last week, Apple reiterated that more states plan to offer the feature in the future, but it did not provide a timeframe.

            In iOS 17 and later, Apple includes an accessibility setting that makes the haptic feedback feature activate faster than in previous versions of its mobile operating system. If you fondly hearken back for the days of 3D Touch, you might just prefer it.

As many iPhone users might remember, ‌3D Touch‌ was an interactive haptic feature that Apple introduced in 2015 with the ‌iPhone‌ 6s. When the iPhone XR was released in 2018, Apple kiboshed 3D Touch‌ to the dismay of some users, and instead implemented the simplified ‌Haptic Touch, which offers less functionality‌.

‌3D Touch‌ supported multiple levels of pressure for different interactions depending on how hard you pressed, with Apple implementing "Peek and Pop" gestures. In contrast, ‌Haptic Touch‌ supports just a single level of pressure for the long pre [...]<br>

"Generative AI techniques have a high potential in getting more design work in less time, and it can be a huge productivity boost," Srouji said.

            Apple won't change the display size of next year's iPhone 18 Pro models, but they'll still look pretty different to what we've generally become accustomed to, rumors are increasingly suggesting.
