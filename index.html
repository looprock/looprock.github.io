            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In the latest beta of tvOS 18.4, there are new hints of Apple's work on a smart home hub accessory that's rumored to be coming as soon as this year. <em>MacRumors</em> found that Apple has added ChatKit framework to the tvOS code, which is curious as there is no Messages app available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> or the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>.

<br/>
The ChatKit framework added to tvOS 18.4 includes reactions and notifications for tapback reactions added to iMessages, like "[person] disliked this" or [person] reacted with [emoji]," which would not be applicable to Apple's current devices that run tvOS.

            The seventh-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> arrives just ten months after the previous model.

<br/>
The ‌2024 ‌iPad Air‌ models have now been discontinued by Apple, but they may still be found refurbished and with third-party resellers for lower prices. As such, some customers may be weighing up whether to buy the 2024 ‌‌iPad Air‌ or the new 2025 models. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> Airs from 2024 and 2025 share most of their key features, so should you consider buying or sticking with the older model to save money?

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> contains the M3 chip, upgraded from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip in the previous generation, so how much better really is M3?

With the introduction of the M3 series in 2023, encompassing the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips, Apple once again set new benchmarks in performance, efficiency, and hardware-accelerated capabilities. The transition from ‌‌M2‌‌ to M3 is marked by Apple's move to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> process, among other key architectural improvements such as a completely redesigned GPU.

The new machine is expected to be equipped with the M4 Max chip that we first saw in the 2024 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> models, but Apple apparently does not have an M4 Ultra chip ready to go.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-03 13:25:52+01:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Hemingway saw in Cézanne a kindred spirit—a man who stripped nature down to its essentials and reassembled it into something honest and uncompromised. Here are a few reasons for his admiration:</p>
<ol>
<li>Structural Purity: Cézanne’s work revolves around reducing forms to their geometric fundamentals. His method of breaking objects down into simple shapes and planes resonated with Hemingway’s own drive for clarity and precision in language. Hemingway’s lean, unadorned prose sought a similar kind of structural integrity—a means to get at the truth beneath the surface.</li>
<li>Minimalism and Truth: Both Cézanne and Hemingway valued the power of minimalism. Cézanne’s deliberate brushstrokes and reduced color palette, which stripped away the nonessential, paralleled Hemingway’s sparse writing style. For Hemingway, art was about capturing the bare reality without extraneous flourish, a quality that Cézanne exemplified in his canvases.</li>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-03 13:24:45+01:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>At its core, “a huevo” is an enthusiastic “hell yeah!” or “damn right!” in Mexican slang. It comes from huevo (which literally means “egg” but is also slang for testicles), but the phrase itself is more about confidence, excitement, or inevitability.</p>
<h1 id="how-its-used">How It’s Used</h1>
<ul>
<li>Agreement or excitement → ”¿Vamos por tacos?” / ”¡A huevo!” (Hell yeah, let’s go!)</li>
<li>Confidence or certainty → “Ganamos el partido.” / “A huevo.” (Of course we won.)</li>
<li>Going all in on something → “Se aventó el proyecto de a huevo.” (He went all out on the project.)</li>
<li>Something being unavoidable → “Es a huevo.” (It’s mandatory.)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="is-it-like-balls-out-in-english">Is It Like “Balls Out” in English?</h1>
<p>Kind of! “A huevo” carries the same bold, all-in energy as saying someone went “balls out” or was “ballsy” in English. The difference? It’s mostly positive—it’s about confidence and enthusiasm, not risk or recklessness.</p>
