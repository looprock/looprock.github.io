            Well, that didn't last long. Less than a day after TikTok became temporarily unavailable in the U.S., the app is now functional again. In an in-app notice, TikTok says the app has been restored "as a result of President Trump's efforts."

<br/>
Last year, the U.S. passed a law that required Chinese company ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok due to potential national security risks, or else the social media platform would be banned. That law <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/tiktok-january-19-ban-imminent/">went into effect today</a>. TikTok is still owned by ByteDance, so <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/18/apple-removes-tiktok-from-app-store-in-us/">Apple removed the app from the App Store in the U.S.</a>, pursuant to the law.

Below, we recap iOS 19 rumors so far.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Redesigned Camera App</h2>
<br/>
A new leak has allegedly revealed a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/ios-19-redesigned-camera-app-visionos-rumor/">redesigned Camera app coming with iOS 19</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
On his YouTube channel Front Page Tech this week, Jon Prosser <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaP_q9W3AQE">shared a video</a> showing what the new Camera app will apparently look like, with the key change being translucent menus for camera controls. Overall, the design of these menus looks similar to visionOS, the software platform for Apple's Vision Pro headset.

Going forward, there will be a new Reels feed that includes videos that your friends have liked or commented on, so you can see what your friends have watched and what they like. Your friends will also be able to see the videos that you have liked, which is something to be aware of.

In this new Reels feed filled with friend recommendations, there will be an option to "start a conversation" with someone over a reel that they've liked.

            On Sunday, January 19, Apple will need to remove TikTok from the U.S. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, because the app will be officially banned in the United States. On the 19th, app distributors and websites will be prohibited from distributing, maintaining, or updating the TikTok app, though the app itself could continue to function on devices where it has already been downloaded. TikTok has said, however, that it plans to shut down the app when the ban begins.
