            Change, those small coins jingling in our pockets, was once an integral part of everyday transactions. As technology continues to reshape the financial landscape, one cannot help but wonder if change, much like its predecessor, cash, is gradually disappearing. This article aims to examine the relevance of change in today's society and explore the idea that people may be phasing out cash.<br>

            “I do like a road, because you can be always wondering what is at the end of it.”
The Story Girl said that once upon a time. Felix and I, on the May morning when we left Toronto for Prince Edward Island, had not then heard her say it, and, indeed, were but barely aware of the existence of such a person as the Story Girl. We did not know her at all under that name. We knew only that a cousin, Sara Stanley, whose mother, our Aunt Felicity, was dead, was living down on the Island with Uncle Roger and Aunt Olivia King, on a farm adjoining the old King homestead in Carlisle. We supposed we should get acquainted with her when we reached there, and we had an idea, from Aunt Olivia’s letters to father, that she would be quite a jolly creature. Further than that we did not think about her. We were more interested in Felicity and Cecily and Dan, who lived on the homestead and would therefore be our roofmates for a season.
But the spirit of the Story Girl’s yet unuttered remark was thrilling in our hearts that morning,  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The house in the hollow was “a mile from anywhere”—so Maywood people said. It was situated in a grassy little dale, looking as if it had never been built like other houses but had grown up there like a big, brown mushroom. It was reached by a long, green lane and almost hidden from view by an encircling growth of young birches. No other house could be seen from it although the village was just over the hill. Ellen Greene said it was the lonesomest place in the world and vowed that she wouldn’t stay there a day if it wasn’t that she pitied the child.
Emily didn’t know she was being pitied and didn’t know what lonesomeness meant. She had plenty of company. There was Father—and Mike—and Saucy Sal. The Wind Woman was always around; and there were the trees—Adam-and-Eve, and the Rooster Pine, and all the friendly lady-birches.
And there was “the flash,” too. She never knew when it might come, and the possibility of it kept her a-thrill and expectant.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>To understand the concept of BRC-20, we might first need to start with <strong>ERC-20</strong>. If you are familiar with Java, you can think of ERC-20 as something like an <strong>Interface</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="whatisaninterfaceyouask"><strong>What is an Interface, you ask?</strong></h2>
<p>It is a skeleton (blueprint) that defines the structure of classes that will implement it. \n E.g., let’s say we want to create a class that defines a <strong>car</strong>. What are the attributes that you can come up with?</p>
<p>\
A car can have different features, such as color, model, speed, etc. <strong>But a car also has common behaviors, such as starting, stopping, accelerating, etc</strong>. These behaviors are what an interface can define. <strong>An interface is like a contract that says what a class can do but not how it does it</strong>.</p>

            <p>I launched my first Unity mobile game back in April 2013. At the time, Unity was starting to gain traction as the framework of choice for mobile game development. I happened to choose it because the developer I outsourced to suggested it.</p>
<p>\
Since then, I have self-published 10+ games; all created using Unity. In addition, I’ve gone on to work for a major mobile games publisher managing million-dollar ad budgets.</p>
<p>\
Here are ten lessons I've learned from designing, creating, and marketing mobile games.</p>

A fair warning: it’s long.</p>

But I promise if you read it all the way through, you’ll save a few years by learning from the mistakes I’ve made.</p>

<p>Prior to launching my first game, I was studying the App Store for months. I read books, watched YouTube videos, and generally blocked out everything else. I was a bit extreme and told my friends, “If it’s not about apps, I don’t want to hear it.”</p>

            While the 13-inch MacBook Air with the M2 chip initially supported Bluetooth 5.0 when it was released in July 2022, the laptop now supports the faster and more reliable Bluetooth 5.3 standard, according to <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-air-13-and-15-m2/specs/">Apple's tech specs</a>.

<br/>
Apple updated the 13-inch MacBook Air's tech specs page to say Bluetooth 5.3 after introducing the 15-inch MacBook Air with Bluetooth 5.3 at WWDC earlier this month. The latest standard offers faster and more reliable connectivity with Bluetooth accessories, and improved power efficiency, which can contribute to longer battery life.

Apple's $3,500 headset is set to go on sale early next year, but analysts have suggested the lengthy gap between its unveiling at WWDC in June and official launch could be more to do with supply chain problems than a way to give developers time to create apps for the device.
