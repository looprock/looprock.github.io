The two key rumors for the Magic Mouse 3 so far include a relocated charging port, along with a more ergonomic design.

It was briefly rumored that the Magic Mouse 3 would also feature voice control, but that was <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1873831058065809689">misinterpreted information</a>.

            Apple's big developer event is a little over two months away, and rumors about what we can expect to see in Apple's next major operating system updates are becoming increasingly frequent.

<br/>
A public release of iOS 18.4 is also imminent with a number of updates and improvements, although we won't be getting the major Apple Intelligence Siri upgrades that had reportedly been planned for this update. This week also saw updated rumors about the iPhone 17 Pro models coming later this year and the first foldable iPhone likely coming as soon as next year, so read on below for all the details!

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>In the past, sellers were responsible for managing and fulfilling their own tax obligations. 
However, more and more jurisdictions are now requiring marketplaces such as Etsy to collect the tax from buyers and remit the tax to the relevant authorities. Etsy now plays an active role in collecting tax from buyers and remitting it all over the world. In this post, I will walk you through our tax calculation infrastructure and how we adapted to the ongoing increase in traffic and business needs over the years.</p>
<p><strong>The tax calculation workflow</strong></p>
<p>We determine tax whenever a buyer adds an item to their Etsy shopping cart. The tax determination is based on buyer and seller location and product category, and a set of tax rules and mappings. To handle the details of these calculations we partner with Vertex, and issue a call to their <a href="https://www.vertexinc.com/">tax engine</a> via the Quotation Request API to get the right amount to show in our buyer's cart. </p>

            Resizing images in macOS is easily done in the Preview app, but if your daily workflow requires you to scale images to a specific size – for uploading to a blog, for example – then using an image resize Quick Action is a much faster way of getting the job done.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-28 05:28:30-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            An iPhone sculpted from a single seamless sheet of glass... It's a vision that was once pursued by former Apple design chief Jony Ive. While the dream was never realized, Apple could take its first tangible step toward it with an all-glass Apple Watch. Or at least that's what one leaker has today suggested. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-965089" height="898" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-Jet-Black.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
According to the Weibo account <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/PkEqB8dkU">Instant Digital</a>, before an all-glass iPhone ever hits the market, we could see an Apple Watch with a touch-interactive, fully-glass frame that blurs the boundaries between screen and enclosure. 
<br/>
<br/>
The Chinese leaker provided no evidence to back their claim. However, the concept appears in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/18/apple-researching-all-glass-designs/">existing Apple patents</a> that describe we [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-28 04:12:11-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Instagram has introduced a new fast-forward feature for Reels that allows users to speed through videos by holding down on either edge of the screen. The action plays content at double speed, similar to a feature already available on TikTok.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The Meta-owned platform initially limited Reels to 15-second clips but has since expanded the maximum duration to three minutes, making playback controls increasingly necessary for users who want to quickly navigate through longer content.
<br/>
<br/>
To use the new feature, simply press and hold on the right or left side of their screen while watching a Reel. The video will then play at 2x speed, enabling you to skip to the parts that interest you most.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's upcoming "iPhone Fold" will feature a foldable screen with a 4:3 aspect ratio, according to a Chinese leaker who previously leaked the book-style device's display dimensions.

The Weibo-based account <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PkBXPoR6V">Digital Chat Station</a> claims that Apple will adopt a "roughly" 4:3 aspect ratio on the inner display in order to achieve consistency between the outer display, as well as to ensure parity with existing iPad software.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple's iPad and iPad Pro models have maintained a 4:3 aspect ratio across generations. The ratio offers a balanced experience in both portrait and landscape orientation, making it particularly versatile for reading/browsing and split-screen multitasking.

            In the mid-to-late 2000s, Facebook was all about staying connected with friends and family. However, as the social media platform added new features and grew over time, that core experience began to get drowned out.

<br/>
That changes starting now, according to Meta, which today <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/03/bringing-magic-of-friends-back-to-facebook/">introduced</a> a new feature that will "bring back the joy" of classic Facebook.
<br/>
<br/>
Specifically, Meta has redesigned the Friends tab on Facebook to focus on the "magic of friends." The page now shows content from only your Facebook friends, with no recommended content or other distractions. The tab will show your friends' posts, reels, birthdays, and more, and it will continue to show your friend requests too.
