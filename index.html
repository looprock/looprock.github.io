Center Stage is a feature that automatically keeps you centered in the camera's view as you move around, while Desk View can show others on a video call both a view of your face and an overhead view of your desk at the same time.

Center Stage is available in video calling apps like FaceTime and Zoom. The feature was previously limited to newer iPad models and Macs connected to Apple's external Studio Display. The new MacBook Pro and iMac models are the first [...]<br>
