After working with numerous enterprise customers implementing AI agents across various industries, a pattern has emerged: The companies finding real success aren’t the ones building the biggest, most ambitious agents — they’re the ones treating agents as microservices.  As of [&#8230;]<br>

The finding comes from leaked kernel debug kit files used by Apple engineers. These kernel debug kit files enumerate unreleased Apple hardware by internal identifiers, such as codenames and platform names, and they can also include separate references that map platform identifiers to chip codenames and marketing names. Secondary summaries and screenshots referencing the same internal code have also circulated in the Chinese tech community over the past week, including posts on Weibo and BiliBili.

The software contains references to an ‌iMac‌ with the identifier J833c running platform H17C. H17C is associated with the code [...]<br>

            Apple and Samsung are best equipped to handle rising memory chip costs that could drive down global smartphone shipments by 2.1% in 2026, according to new data from <a href="https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/2026-smartphone-shipment-forecasts-revised-down-as-memory-shortage-drives-bom-costs-up">Counterpoint Research</a>.

In its latest projection for the smartphone market next year, the firm has downgraded its forecast from a previously expected 0.45% growth, citing a memory shortage that has pushed component costs up 10% to 25%. Chinese brands like Honor and Oppo are said to face greater pressure due to lower profit margins, particularly in the entry-level segment where costs have jumped 20% to 30% since early 2025.

The Weibo-based account claims Apple is adopting this strategy – foldable first, 20th anniversary iPhone second – to gauge consumer reaction to the under-screen camera, where the lens is literally concealed behind the panel with no visible cutouts in the display.

Apple's foldable is also understood to be utilizing side-button integrated Touch ID over Face ID for biometric authentication due to internal space constraints. This means the "iPhone Fold" will have the first all-screen display of any Apple device – a d [...]<br>

<br/>
In some cases, it's obvious what the feature flags are referring to, while some are more vague and harder to interpret. We've included the feature flag and a short explanation of what it might reference, but keep in mind that Apple doesn't provide full explanations because this is all internal code. We're working off of titles and internal organization, but there are still hints of what may be coming in the future.

            Last week, details about unreleased Apple devices and future iOS features were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/10/ipad-12-a19-chip/">shared by <em>Macworld</em></a>. This week, we learned where the information came from, plus we have more findings from the leak.

<br/>
As it turns out, an Apple prototype device running an early build of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> was sold, and the person who bought it shared the software. The OS has a version number of 23A5234w, and the first developer beta of ‌iOS 26‌ was 23A5260n, so it dates back to before that initial beta. Apple was still calling it iOS 19 internally at that time, so the software is labeled iOS 19 rather than ‌iOS 26‌.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 26.3 adds a new "Notification Forwarding" setting that allows incoming notifications on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to be forwarded to a third-party device.

<br/>
The setting is located in the Notification section of the Settings app under a new "Notification Forwarding" option. Apple says that notifications can only be forwarded to a single device at a time, so if Notification Forwarding is enabled with a third-party wearable, the Apple Watch won't able to receive and display notifications.
<br/>
<br/>
Users can choose to have a device receive notifications only from selected apps rather than all apps, and notifications will include the name of the app and all content contained in the notification. This is a feature that is only available to those living in Europe.

The latest version of the Apple Sports app includes images for the men's PGA Tour and the women's LPGA hidden within the app's code, according to <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris. While users cannot yet follow the PGA Tour or LPGA in the app, the addition of the images suggests that support is coming soon.

The app already supports the NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, Premier League, NASCAR, F1, Premier League, and more, and golf will further expand the selection.

            X (Twitter) has rolled out a <a href="https://x.com/X/status/1999910734692757654?s=20">set of widgets</a> for its iOS app, enabling users to add feeds to their Home screen as well as a real-time notification count to their Lock Screen.

<br/>
The Home screen widget offers only one kind, called "X News Highlights," which displays headlines of what's trending on the social media platform. The widget is available in three sizes.
<br/>
<br/>
There's more to be said for the Lock Screen widgets, which all come in larger and smaller kinds. "X Notifications" shows the user's notification count, while "X Messages" displays the number of unread messages in X Chat (encrypted DMs). There are also two Grok AI widgets, one for jumping straight into chat and one for voice conversations.

While this process introduced complexity by layering authorization, the resulting gains in speed and efficiency are highly transformational.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Eventually, software is very hard to change. There are numerous reasons for this, and they often don’t even involve the software. The systems that run the software are old, regulators don’t let you change things, security controls, people have just forgotten how to program COBOL. There is so much code that it’s hard to know what the code does.</p>
<p>So when you want to change it, you don’t know what to do. The ultimate sign of legacy software is that you don’t know how to test it after making changes. If you can’t test software, you can’t safely make changes, the Michael Feathers definition of legacy code.</p>
<p>I could get distracted by discussing the reasons, but we all know that <a href="https://cote.io/legacytrap/">software just becomes “legacy” at some point</a>.</p>
