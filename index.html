<p id="xYOMJF">Google’s latest update for its Meet video conferencing software is designed to make its picture-in-picture mode more useful, allowing you to work (or, perhaps, slack off) in other windows on your desktop without giving up crucial Meet controls. According to <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/06/enhanced-experience-picture-in-picture-google-meet-chrome.html">Google’s announcement</a>, the features will be available when using Google Meet via its Chrome browser, and will be rolling out to everyone over the next couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I wanted to include the things I put in are.na here, on <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a>, but finding their RSS feed is elusive.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://fraidyc.at">Fridaycat</a>, I found how. If you <a href="https://github.com/kickscondor/fraidycat/blob/master/defs/social.json">look in their source code</a>, you can see that all you have to do is append /feed/rss to the end of an are.na channel page and you get an RSS feed.</p>

            WhatsApp today <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com">introduced</a> Channels, a feed-style one-way broadcast service coming to the popular chat platform where admins can send text, photos, videos, stickers, and polls to followers.

WhatsApp calls Channels "a simple, reliable, and private way to receive important updates from people and organizations," and cites hobbies, sports teams, and updates from local authorities as examples.
<br/>
<br/>
The personal information of admins is kept hidden from followers, so things like phone number and photo profile aren't shown. Likewise, following a channel won't reveal your phone number to the admin or other followers. Admins will also have the option to block screenshots and forwards from their channel.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-06-08 01:34:51-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple in iOS 17 has revised several elements of its stock apps, including the Podcasts app. There are a few noteworthy changes to the functionality and design of the app with the update, as detailed below.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The biggest change is a slick new design for the Now Playing screen, which allows the podcast's full show page art – or any episode chapter images – to take over the entire screen. 
<br/>
<br/>
The playback controls on the bottom half of the screen have also been rejigged. The play speed button has been moved from the bottom left corner of the screen and now sits next to the rewind button.

            With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> not set to launch until 2024, there's a lot that we don't know about it. Apple has given us a rough overview of the hardware that's inside, but hasn't gone into detail on the different components or specifications.

            Apple in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> is adding a new feature to iOS that is designed to automatically block incoming messages and files that may have sensitive content like nudity.

Opt-in blurring can be applied to sensitive images sent in Messages, AirDrop, Contact Posters for the Phone app, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> messages, and third-party apps. The feature will prevent adult <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users from being subjected to unwanted imagery.

            Apple's new Vision Pro headset is controlled with eye and hand movements by default.
