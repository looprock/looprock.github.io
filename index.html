While the Mac Pro is configured with SSD storage, it has SATA ports for connecting internal hard drives, and some can disconnect due to a bug.

"Certain models of internal SATA drives might unexpectedly disconnect from your computer after your Mac wakes from sleep," said Apple. "This can occur if your Mac automatically goes to sleep or if you manually put your Mac to sleep. If you see a message that your disk was not ejected properly, you can restart your Mac to reconnect to the drive."

<p>Changes to the Reddit API are forcing beloved apps like Apollo to shut down, and Redditors aren’t happy.</p> <p id="AJ5y1Q">Reddit’s new API updates announced in April could change the platform forever — but maybe not in a good way. Ever since Apollo for Reddit developer Christian Selig revealed he’d be on the hook for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/31/23743993/reddit-apollo-client-api-cost">$20 million per year</a> due to the changes, Redditors have been furious over how the updates might affect third-party apps. </p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In macOS Sonoma, currently in beta, you can create individual web apps for any website that you frequent in Safari, and have them sit beside other apps in your Dock. Let's take a closer look at how it all works by turning MacRumors.com into a virtual Mac app as an example.

<br/>
In macOS Sonoma, any website viewed in Safari can be turned into a web app, thanks to a new "Add to Dock" option in the File menu. In other words, no work is required on the part of web developers to make a site web app compatible, although there are some elements of web apps that developers can have control over (see below).

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-06-13 20:46:18-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In a pair of support documents, Apple has listed various external display combinations that <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213681">can be used with the new Mac Studio</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213665">Mac Pro</a>. For example, both Macs support up to eight 4K displays at 60Hz when configured with the M2 Ultra chip.

<br/>
The new Mac Studio has an HDMI 2.1 port, and the new Mac Pro has two. These ports each support an 8K display at 60Hz, or a 4K display at 240Hz. Apple says the M2 Ultra chip also supports up to six Pro Display XDRs.
<br/>
<br/>
The previous Mac Studio supported up to five external displays when configured with the M1 Ultra chip, so the new model supporting up to eight is a considerable improvement. Apple silicon has come a long way in this area since the first Mac [...]<br>
