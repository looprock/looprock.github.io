If you're familiar with Instagram, you probably know what a boomerang is.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Developers who want to develop browsers for iOS with third-party engines can only test their apps on devices physically located in the EU, according to <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/17/apple_browser_eu/"><em>The Register</em></a>.

<br/>
This rule introduces a considerable barrier for developers outside the EU, who are now limited to using simulators instead of actual devices for testing their browsers. This restriction complicates the process of developing and supporting browsers with alternative engines, as on-device testing is essential to accurate performance assessment and troubleshooting. Apple's previous policy, which remains in place in other regions around the world, demands the use of WebKit for all iOS and iPadOS browsers, effectively making every browser on these platforms a variant of Safari.
