<p><blockquote>
When I started focusing on TDE, it was going to require changes to buffer reads/writes, WAL, and require a way to store secret keys.  I thought those changes
would be acceptable given TDE's security value.  Once file I/O changes were required, I think the balance tilted to TDE requiring too many code changes given
its security value (not policy compliance value).</blockquote></p> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has confirmed that its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-unveils-c1/">custom-designed C1 modem</a> in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-announces-iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a> has nothing to do with the device's lack of MagSafe support, <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2614585/iphone-16e-without-magsafe-apple-modem-c1-is-the-reason.html">according to <em>Macworld</em></a>.

<br/>
Following the launch of the iPhone 16e, there was some speculation online about how MagSafe magnets might have interfered with the C1 modem's cellular connectivity performance, and this was considered to be a potential reason for the device not supporting MagSafe. But, that explanation is not true, according to Apple.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has withdrawn its Advanced Data Protection iCloud feature from the United Kingdom following government demands for backdoor access to encrypted user data, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/apple-removes-end-to-end-encryption-feature-from-uk-after-backdoor-order"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. The move comes after UK officials secretly ordered Apple to provide unrestricted access to encrypted iCloud content worldwide.

<br/>
Customers who are already using Advanced Data Protection, or ADP, will need to manually disable it during an unspecified grace period to keep their iCloud accounts, according to the report. Apple said it will issue additional guidance in the future to affected users and that it "does not have the ability to automatically disable it on their behalf."

            Earlier this week, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said all four iPhone 17 models will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/kuo-iphone-17-models-apple-designed-wi-fi-7-chip/">equipped with Apple's first-ever custom-designed Wi-Fi chip</a>.

All four iPhone 17 models will feature an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip, according to Jeff Pu, an analyst who covers companies within Apple's supply chain. He shared this information in a research note with GF Securities earlier this month.

<br/>
The entire iPhone 16 lineup already supports Wi-Fi 7, so this is not much of a surprise, but the fact that the chip will be designed by Apple is notable. Apple recently debuted its &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/2 [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>I’d like to thank everyone who’s been reaching out and expressed support for another Monitorama event. Like many of you, I truly enjoy the community and environment we’ve created together, and look forward to each upcoming event with a palpable sense of excitement (and panic).</p><p>Unfortunately, we’re going to take a pause this year. The short story is that things just didn’t click into place like I’d hoped, and rather than deliver a compromised experience, I figure it makes more sense to just step back, regroup, and plan for an even more amazing event in the not-too-distant future.</p><p>If you have any questions or would just like to chat, feel free to connect at <a href="mailto:info@monitorama.com">info@monitorama.com</a> (or in the community Slack if you’re already a member). In the meantime I hope you’ll keep us in mind for 2026.</p><p>Yours truly,<br/>Jason Dixon</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*c8xKg-A0nok_LxUTMfpfmQ.jpeg"/></figure>&lt;img alt="" height="1" sr [...]<br>
