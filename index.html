            OpenAI has updated the <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt/download/">ChatGPT app for macOS</a> with the ability to directly edit code in popular development environments including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains tools.

<br/>
The new feature allows the AI chatbot to make changes to code without requiring users to copy and paste between applications. ChatGPT can now read code from these environments and make edits directly within them.

<br/>
An optional "auto-apply" mode enables ChatGPT to implement changes without additional clicks.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has increased the thickness of the upcoming iPhone 17 Pro Max compared to the current generation iPhone 16 Pro Max, claims the Chinese leaker known as <a href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/PhqFQjY5b">Ice Universe</a>.

<br/>
Apple is said to have increased the depth of the iPhone 17 Pro Max to 8.725mm, up from 8.25mm on the iPhone 16 Pro Max, which would be a 0.475mm difference in thickness. The increase "surely means a larger battery," according to the leaker. Apart from depth, the iPhone 17 Pro Max's frame reportedly <a href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/PhqQrs9PB">remains unchanged</a>, and is otherwise identical to the iPhone 16 Pro Max.

<br/>
Posting to their <a href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/PhqSED0hS">Weibo account</a>, the Chinese leaker today claimed that the iPhone 17 Air and iPhone 17 Pro Max have identical body length, width, screen size, and bezels.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Popular password management app 1Password <a href="https://blog.1password.com/add-locations-to-items/">today announced</a> a new feature that allows you to view logins, passwords, alarm codes, PINs, and more based on your location.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-846338" height="1266" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/1password-deal-blue.jpg" width="2250"/>
<br/>
You can now assign locations to items stored in your vault, and those items will show up in the 1Password app for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> when you're near those physical locations.
<br/>
<br/>
So, for example, if you have work-related passwords in the app, you can set it up so those passwords will be surfaced first when you're at work. Or, if you're at the Starbucks, you can have it surface your Starbucks Rewards number. Or your medical record number if you're at the doctor's office.
