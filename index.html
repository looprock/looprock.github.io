Chat is rolling out on iOS now via the X app, and it includes support for video and voice calls, disappearing messages, and file sharing, as well as the ability to edit and delete previously sent messages. 
<br/>
<br/>
Any old messages should be carried across to Chat from the old DM system on X (formerly Twitter). Users also have options to block screenshots and get notified of attempts to take them. However, it's worth noting that the E2EE support doesn't encrypt message metadata, and this can include information about the sender as well as the recipient.

X also says that its system lacks safeguards against man-in-the-middle attacks, meaning an encrypted chat could be intercepted without either partic [...]<br>

<p>The McKinsey survey shows one clear signal of progress – workflow redesign. The companies with more success in using effectively using AI, about half say they’re using technology not just to do things faster, but to essentially rewrite how their business works.
