The service will officially cease operating on February 16, 2026. Setapp Mobile <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/17/macpaw-launches-setapp-mobile-eu/">launched in open beta</a> in September 2024.

In a <a href="https://support.setapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/13690464925212-About-Setapp-Mobile">support page</a>, MacPaw said Setapp Mobile is being closed because of app marketplaces' "still-evolving and complex business terms that don't fit Setapp's current business model," suggesting it was not profitable for the company.

<p>I can see how it happens. You get an app into production, it runs fine, and then you moveon to the next thing. Meanwhile, the version drifts into “End of Life” territory. OSS support ends (like way back in mid-2023 for the Spring version DaShaun mentioned). If you’re running that today without a commercial contract, you are missing over a dozen essential security patches. Or hoping you can handle it yourself…</p>

            Apple's upcoming iPhone 17e will feature a Dynamic Island instead of a notch at the top of the screen, but unlike the rest of the iPhone 17 lineup, the display itself will still refresh at 60Hz, according to a known Weibo leaker.

Apple made major improvements to the iPhone 17's display last year, introducing ProMotion display technology with up to a 120Hz refresh rate, similar to recent iPhone Pro models. 120Hz maximum refresh rates allow for smoother scrolling when viewing webpages and improvements for video, but it looks like the iPhone 17e is not getting the upgrade to keep costs down.

            <p>Winning in AI is now defined as having a great chat app, not the AI infrastructure running that app. Amazon (AWS) has no chat app (that I know of, which is the point!), so people don’t think they’re winning. If AWS did have an app, and evolved it as a product, they would be at the AI table.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter that AWS might have the “picks and shovels.” That’s not where the definitional power and attention and leaderboard is.</p>
<p>Analogously, Dell doesn’t define much at all (anything?) in the market despite how many apps and workloads run on Dell laptops, servers, etc. Neither does Cisco, etc.</p>
<p>In new, all-consuming tech categories, like AI, you have to chase the use case, deliver apps for it, and constantly churn out new features. And in AI, that’s currently a chat app.</p>
<p>In contrast to AWS, look at Google. If Google didn’t have Gemini Chat, NotebookLM, Nano Banana…we wouldn’t think they were “winning"AI.</p>
