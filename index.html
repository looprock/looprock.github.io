As noted by David Tesler (via <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/30/screenshots-suggest-tiktok-is-circumventing-apple-app-store-commissions/">TechCrunch</a></em>) TikTok has been offering a limited number of TikTok app users an option to purchase coins on TikTok.com instead of in the app. "Try recharging on tiktok.com to avoid in-app service fees," reads the text. "You can save the service fee and get access to popular payment methods."

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iOS 17.5, Apple is adding a "Repair State" feature that is designed to allow an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to be sent in for service without deactivating <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> and Activation Lock. The fourth iOS 17.5 beta that came out today adds a "Remove This Device" option for all devices in ‌Find My‌, and using it with an ‌iPhone‌ puts that ‌iPhone‌ into the new Repair State.

            Apple today released a firmware update for the USB-C <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> that came out last year.

<br/>
There is no word on what features, fixes, or updates might be included in the new firmware, and Apple does not offer release notes for ‌Apple Pencil‌ software releases.
<br/>
<br/>
The USB-C ‌Apple Pencil‌ is nearly identical in design to the ‌Apple Pencil‌ 2, but it is shorter and has a hidden USB-C port for charging and pairing. It cannot wirelessly charge, and it lacks some of the features available with the more expensive ‌Apple Pencil‌ models such as pressure sensitivity.

            Introduction: Delving into the critical issues of overflow and underflow, Herbert&rsquo;s insights offer valuable takeaways for Rust developers:
Rust&rsquo;s static analysis capabilities enable early detection and prevention of overflow and underflow errors, allowing developers to address potential issues before they manifest in runtime environments.
Through Rust&rsquo;s emphasis on safety and correctness, developers can leverage built-in mechanisms to handle overflow and underflow situations gracefully, reducing the likelihood of software crashes and unexpected behavior.<br>
