            <b>Published:</b> 2024-03-30 10:43:40-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is currently offering its corporate and retail employees 40% off select Link Bracelet and Milanese Loop bands for the Apple Watch.
<br/>

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928625" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-Link-Bracelets.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
In the U.S., the Link Bracelet is available for $209 on Apple's online store for employees, down from $349 regularly. The Milanese Loop is available for $59, down from $99. Both bands were introduced alongside the original Apple Watch in 2015.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also offering employees 50% off various Black Unity and Pride Edition bands, as well as the Sport Band in the Midnight color only.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple offers employees special discounts on a rotating selection of products, so it is unclear whether this is another routine sale, or if the company plans to discontinue the Link Bracelet and Milanese Loop in the future and is clearing inventory.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-03-30 06:00:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The iPhone 15 offers "lots of storage for lots of photos," or at least that's what Apple boasts in its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/apple-iphone-15-storage-ad/">latest ad</a>. Whether that rings true for you depends on what you do with your iPhone, and which storage option you choose. But before you open your wallet, here are some things to consider.

<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-741340" height="675" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/05/iPhone-12-128GB-Feature.png" width="1200"/>
<br/>
The entry-level storage tier for the iPhone 15 is 128GB. That's a notable increase from the 64GB baseline that persisted until the iPhone 13 in 2021. When you consider that 2018's iPhone X came with as little as 64GB, the base storage option for Apple's latest device might even begin to sound generous.

However, this generational upward shift simply reflects the growing demand for more storage space as our digital habits broaden to encompass ev [...]<br>

<br/>
Apple's original plan was to rely on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/apple-has-two-suppliers-for-oled-ipad-pro/">different OLED display suppliers</a> for the upcoming iPad Pro models, with Samsung Display exclusively producing ~11-inch panels and LG Display responsible for the required ~13-inch panels. 
<br/>
<br/>
The division of labor was reportedly due to changes in Apple's demand outlook for OLED iPad Pro models, as well as the unstable production capacity and yield of the two suppliers, which are both still getting to grips with Apple's requirement for new panel technologies.

Early reports suggested the new models could arrive as soon as this month. However, according t [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Oregon this week signed a Right to Repair bill into law, and it is notable because it is the first such law that puts a stop to the practice of parts pairing. Manufacturers like Apple are not able to require customers to use Apple-sourced parts that then have to be authenticated, with the bill giving Apple device owners the right to use new parts, used parts, or third-party parts.

<br/>
Apple has launched repair tools for both independent repair shops and consumers, but repair components must be purchased directly from Apple. Components must be paired with a device serial number after being installed, which prevents unauthorized repairs that use third-party components. The bill states that companies cannot reduce the performance of a device or display misleading warnings for parts that are not properly paired [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Amazon today <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-one-app">launched the Amazon One app</a>, which is designed to allow customers to scan their palms to make device-free purchases at Whole Foods, Panera Bread, and 150 third-party locations in stadiums, airports, fitness centers, and convenience stores.

<br/>
Prior to the launch of the app, signing up for Amazon One had to be done in a physical location with an Amazon One device. The app lets customers create a profile, take a photo of their palm, and add a payment method. Finishing sign-up will still require an initial interaction with an Amazon One machine.
<br/>
<br/>
Amazon One can be used for payment, entry to venues, age verification, and loyalty rewards. The service uses generative AI to match a camera phone photo of a person's palm to near-infrared imagery from an Amazon One scanner.
<br/>
<br/>
The AI system is able to pair palm and vein imagery to create a unique, numerical vecto [...]<br>
