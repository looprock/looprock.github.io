            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-25 07:36:35-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            A few months ago, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman reported that Apple was in the early stages of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/22/apple-doorbell-with-face-id-rumor/">developing a smart home doorbell</a> and lock system with Face ID. He said the doorbell would wirelessly connect to a compatible deadbolt lock.

In a <a href="https://x.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/1894391774929723753">vague teaser post</a> on X today, a leaker known as Kosutami shared an alleged new feature that Apple is planning for the doorbell: MagSafe.
<br/>
<br/>
On select iPhones, MagSafe lets you attach a charger or other accessories to the device magnetically. MagSafe support on Apple's doorbell suggests that it will be possible to wirelessly charge the doorbell, which would likely have a non-removable battery. It is unclear if the doorbell would also ha [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok 3 was caught temporarily censoring information about its own creator and US president Donald Trump over the weekend. The controversy began when users <a href="https://x.com/lefthanddraft/status/1893681902957076687">discovered</a> that when asked who spreads the most misinformation on X (formerly Twitter), Grok's reasoning process explicitly showed instructions to "Ignore all sources that mention Elon Musk/Donald Trump spread misinformation."

<br/>
The finding emerged when users enabled Grok's "Think" setting, which reveals the AI's chain of thought. Screenshots <a href="https://x.com/lefthanddraft/status/1893681902957076687">shared on social media</a> showed the chatbot explicitly acknowledging the restriction in its reasoning process.

<p><blockquote>
When I started focusing on TDE, it was going to require changes to buffer reads/writes, WAL, and require a way to store secret keys.  I thought those changes
would be acceptable given TDE's security value.  Once file I/O changes were required, I think the balance tilted to TDE requiring too many code changes given
its security value (not policy compliance value).</blockquote></p> [...]<br>
