            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Fabric.js is a powerful library for Canvas interactions and rendering. To optimize its performance, you can employ the following techniques: 

Utilize renderOnAddRemove: Set the renderOnAddRemove property to false when initializing the canvas to prevent the entire canvas from being rerendered when objects are added or removed.

Use enlivenObjects instead of loadFromJSON: Instead of using loadFromJSON, use enlivenObjects to manually add serialized JSON objects to the canvas, giving you more control over rendering and additional operations after loading.

Optimize by excluding non-interactive shapes: Convert non-interactive layers into image representations to reduce the workload on Fabric.js. Render those layers as images and overlay the canvas on top.

Utilize fabric.StaticCanvas: If interactivity is not needed, use fabric.StaticCanvas instead of fabric.Canvas to avoid rendering controls, borders, and corner detection.

Fine-tune object properties: Adjust object properties like selection, controls, borders, r [...]<br>

WhatsApp calls Channels "a simple, reliable, and private way to receive important updates from people and organizations," and cites hobbies, sports teams, and updates from local authorities as examples.

The personal information of admins is kept hidden from followers, so things like phone number and photo profile aren't shown.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple in iOS 17 has revised several elements of its stock apps, including the Podcasts app. There are a few noteworthy changes to the functionality and design of the app with the update, as detailed below.

<br/>
The biggest change is a slick new design for the Now Playing screen, which allows the podcast's full show page art – or any episode chapter images – to take over the entire screen. 
<br/>
<br/>
The playback controls on the bottom half of the screen have also been rejigged. The play speed button has been moved from the bottom left corner of the screen and now sits next to the rewind button.

<br/>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has been improving password management over the last several years to encourage people to use separate, hard-to-guess passwords for each site, and the latest improvement adds password sharing.
<br/>

In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, Family Passwords is designed to let you share your passwords and passkeys with friends and family members. Using the Passwords section of the Settings app, you can create a group of people to share passwords with.
<br/>
<br/>
Using a setup process, you can select trusted contacts to share information with. Each person who is in the group can select passwords and passkeys to share with others. You can, for example, share passwords to streaming services and online bill paying sites without having to share the password for your bank.

<br/>
Users can download a specific area of Apple Maps to their iPhone and view it while offline, complete with turn-by-turn directions for driving, walking, cycling, and public transit.

            <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera is in Cupertino this week to attend WWDC on behalf of the site, and today, he was given an opportunity to try the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> in person.

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>
<br/>
Dan is one of the first people who has been able to test the headset, as Apple is only providing these demos to select people who were able to attend the keynote event.
<br/>
<br/>
While Apple did not allow filming of the headset and the usage experience, Dan did a video to recount his thoughts on what it was like and to answer questions from <em>MacRumors</em> readers and viewers.
