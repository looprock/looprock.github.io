            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Here is something that Apple TV HD owners probably didn't expect when they purchased the device all the way back in 2015: it continues to receive software updates.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-870258" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/apple-tv-4k-yellow-bg-feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Apple's developer website confirms that the tvOS 18 update unveiled today is compatible with all Apple TV HD and Apple TV 4K models.

tvOS 18 compatibility list:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>Apple TV HD (2015)</li>

<li>Apple TV 4K (2nd Generation) (2021)</li>
<br/>
<li>Apple TV 4K (3rd Generation) (2022)</li></ul>
<br/>

tvOS 18 introduces a new InSight feature, includes updates to Enhance Dialogue and subtitles, adds new screen savers, supports 21:9 video playback for playing movies and shows on projectors, and more, as outlined in &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/tvos-gaining-insi [...]<br>

            With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple is expanding the Emergency SOS via satellite feature to introduce Messages via satellite, a feature that will let you send texts even when you don't have a Wi-Fi or cellular connection.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954617" height="1252" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/messages-via-satellite.jpg" width="2226"/>
<br/>
Available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> or later, you can send and receive iMessages or SMS messages using a satellite connection. The feature works with all iMessage features such as emoji and Tapbacks, plus with iMessage, conversations are end-to-end encrypted.

<br/>
Messages via satellite will work on the ‌iPhone 14‌ and later, aka the same devices that support Emergency SOS via satellite. Apple did not specify whether there will be a cost for Messages via satellite, but Emergency SOS via satellite [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today confirmed that it plans to implement support for Rich Communication Services, or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a>, in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> this fall.

<br/>
We've known about Apple's plans to adopt ‌RCS‌ since last November, but Apple only gave a vague "later in 2024" timeline for adoption so it was unclear exactly when the feature might roll out. ‌RCS‌ replaces SMS/MMS as the default communication protocol on the ‌iPhone‌.

‌RCS‌ has already been adopted by Google, U.S. smartphone carriers, and other companies,  [...]<br>

            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia feature a new, dedicated Passwords app for faster access to important credentials.

<br/>
The Passwords app replaces <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Keychain, which is currently only accessible via a menu in Settings. Now, passwords are available directly via a standalone app for markedly quicker access, bringing it more in line with rival services.
<br/>
<br/>
The Passwords app consolidates various credentials, including passwords, passkeys, and Wi-Fi passwords, into a single, easily accessible location. Users can filter and sort their accounts based on various criteria, such as recently created accounts, credential type, or membership in shared groups.

Less crass: be easy/instant to install and run, and have good docs that explain how to do [I&rsquo;d say 2 to 3 example apps/uses]. Even better: be a SaaS, at least have that as an option. All of this advice is pretty difficult for a full on, private cloud platform to do. You can&rsquo;t just &ldquo;install a cloud&rdquo; in a few minutes and mess around with it. Let alone, like, multi-region, etc. I think. Maybe someone could figure it out? That would actually be a good sign: if your platform is easy to install for demo&rsquo;ing, it will probably be easy to install for reals.<!-- category:link --></p><br>
