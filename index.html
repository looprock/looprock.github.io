            Google Maps now lets you talk to Gemini while following walking or cycling directions. The <a href="https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/maps/gemini-navigation-biking-walking/">latest update</a> is an extension to the AI chatbot's existing conversational navigation feature in driving mode that rolled out in November.

<br/>
You can now ask Gemini hands-free questions without leaving the navigation screen. While walking, for example, you can ask things like "Tell me more about this neighborhood" or "Are there cafes with a bathroom along my route?" Cyclists can also check their ETA without taking their hands off the handlebars.

Postgres?</a>  It's an unusual talk because it explains the missing features of Postgres, and why.  One thing I learned in writing the talk is that the majority of our missing features
are performance-related, rather than functionality-related.  I took many questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>some pointed out that extensions supply much of this missing functionality
  </li><li>some supported the lack of features because the features are either unnecessary or harmful
  </li><li>some features are in-progress (<a class="txt2html" href="https://momjian.us/main/writings/pgsql/missing.pdf#page=31" style="text-decoration: underline dotted;">slide 31</a>)

<blockquote>
<p>AI is still stuck in “efficiency mode.” In many organizations, a technology organization leads AI efforts and is treated as a cost center. Those CIOs are incentivized to optimize for efficiency, not growth. The result is predictable: Tech-led AI strategies deliver productivity improvements, but not transformation. Equally concerning is that technology and AI executives tell us their business partners can’t articulate what they want from AI beyond saving money. That leadership gap bleeds over into the measurement of AI value.</p>
<p>While most agree that AI boosts productivity, only 13% report positive EBITDA impact, and fewer than a third link AI contributions to P&amp;L. Without financial accountability, AI becomes an endless pilot treadmill — producin</p></blockquote> [...]<br>
