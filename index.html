Below, we recap rumors about the next-generation HomePod mini.

            Apple's latest macOS Sequoia 15.2 update has introduced a critical bug that prevents the popular backup utility <a href="https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper</a> from creating bootable backups, according to the app's chief developer, Shirt Pocket's <a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/youre_a_mean_one/">Dave Nanian</a>.

The issue stems from a "Resource Busy" error that occurs during the final stages of the backup process when attempting to copy system preboot or recovery files.
