            Apple's big week is almost here, with WWDC 2025 kicking off on Monday with what we're expecting to be a jam-packed look at the company's software platforms, including some redesigns and rebranding.

<br/>
While we're not expecting any imminent hardware launches to come out of WWDC, we're just three months away from the debut of the iPhone 17 lineup and we've got fresh details on not only some of those models but also what's in the works for the iPhone 18 lineup in 2026, so read on below for all the details on these stories and more!

<h2>WWDC 2025 Preview: Apple's iOS 26 Design Overhaul, macOS Tahoe, and Much More</h2>
<br/>
Just a week ahead of the WWDC keynote, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/apple-sleek-peek/">updated the teaser tagline for the event</a> from "On the horizon" to "Sleek peek [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            macOS 26 will drop support for several older Intel-based Mac models currently compatible with macOS Sequoia, according to a private account on X with a proven track record of leaking information about Apple's software platforms.

<br/>
macOS 26 will be compatible with the following Mac models, the account said:<ul><li>MacBook Air (M1 and later)</li>
<br/>
<li>MacBook Pro (2019 and later)</li>
<br/>
<li>iMac (2020 and later)</li>
<br/>
<li>Mac mini (M1 and later)</li>
<br/>
<li>Mac Studio (all models)</li>
<br/>
<li>Mac Pro (2019 and later)</li>
