            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has quietly tweaked its Home app webpage to indicate that its upcoming robot vacuum control feature will now arrive in early 2025 rather than later this year, as previously advertised. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955897" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Roomba-and-HomeKit-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
When support is added, Apple device users will be able to start a robot vacuum via HomeKit automations and scenes, or ask Siri to clean a specific room. Apple says the Home app will support the "core functionality" of robot vacuum cleaners, such as vacuuming, mopping, power control, cleaning mode, and charge status.

Apple said at WWDC in June that the iOS 18 feature would arrive <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/14/ios-18-preferred-home-hub/">later in 2024</a> – presumably with iOS 18.2, due this month – but that's apparently no longer the case.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-12-02 02:57:23-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WhatsApp is set to end support for iOS versions older than iOS 15.1 from May next year, removing the chat platform's compatibility with several iPhone models in the process.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786421" height="1266" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Whatsapp-Feature.jpg" width="2250"/>
<br/>
From May 5, 2025, WhatsApp will no longer be compatible with iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus models. Users with those devices won't be able to access the encrypted chat service after the specified date unless they upgrade their iPhone.
<br/>
<br/>
Users who intend to upgrade can back up their WhatsApp chats to iCloud, and restore their full chat and media history to a newer, supported device using using WhatsApp's Chat Transfer feature. Instructions on how to do so are outlined in WhatsApp's <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/209942271778103/?cms_platform=iphone&amp;helpref=platform_switcher">Help Center</a>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has ordered M5 chips from TSMC as the company begins production development of its next-generation processor for future devices, reports Korean-language outlet <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=30847">The Elec</a></em> citing Taiwanese media.

<br/>
The M5 series is expected to feature an enhanced ARM architecture and will reportedly be manufactured using TSMC's advanced 3-nanometer process technology. Apple's decision to forgo TSMC's more advanced 2nm process for the M5 chip is believed to be primarily due to cost considerations. Despite this, the M5 will feature significant advancements over the M4, notably through the adoption of TSMC's System on Integrated Chip (SoIC) technology.
