            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iPhone development roadmap runs several years into the future and the company is continually working with suppliers on several successive iPhone models at the same time, which is why we often get rumored features months ahead of launch. The iPhone 18 series is no different, and we already have a good idea of what to expect for the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1018297" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/iPhone-17-Pro-Cosmic-Orange.jpg" width="1960"/>
<br/>
One thing worth noting is that Apple is reportedly planning a major change to its iPhone release cycle next year, adopting a two-phase rollout starting with the iPhone 18 series. That means the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and iPhone Fold will be released in September 2026, followed by the iPhone 18 and iPhone 18e in spring 2027.

<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/29/forrester_ai_rehiring/">Forrester’s analysis</a> found that using AI for financially driven layoffs can backfire: 55 percent of employers regret laying off workers because of AI. More people in charge of AI investment expect it to increase headcount (57 percent) than to decrease it (15 percent) over the next year.</p>

<p>Either that, or start by replacing the executives with an AI. A more retention friendly alternate would be to give staff a month long sabbatical and require executives to only use AIs for a month. If they wanted to be really 9-9-6, make that quarter sabbatical .</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple researchers have released <a href="https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19808">Pico-Banana-400K</a>, a comprehensive dataset of 400,000 curated images that's been specifically designed to improve how AI systems edit photos based on text prompts.

<br/>
The massive dataset aims to address what Apple describes as a gap in current AI image editing training. While systems like GPT-4o can make impressive edits, the researchers say progress has been limited by inadequate training data built from real photographs. Apple's new dataset aims to improve the situation.
<br/>
<br/>
Pico-Banana-400K features images organized into 35 different edit types across eight categories, from basic adjustments like color changes to complex transformations such as converting people into Pixar-style characters or LEGO figures. Each image went throu [...]<br>

            IPv4 scarcity drives widespread use of Carrier-Grade Network Address Translation, a practice in ISPs and mobile networks that places many users behind each IP address, along with their collected activity and volumes of traffic.

            Many products at Cloudflare aren’t possible without pushing the limits of network hardware and software to deliver improved performance, increased efficiency, or novel capabilities such as soft-unicast, our method for sharing IP subnets across data centers. Happily, most people do not need to know the intricacies of how your operating system handles network and Internet access in general. Yes, even most people within Cloudflare. But sometimes we try to push well beyond the design intentions of Linux’s networking stack. This is a story about one of those attempts.<br>
