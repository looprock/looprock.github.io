            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> can be used as a display for a connected Mac, but it is bulky, heavy, and uncomfortable. The <a href="https://www.sightful.com">Spacetop G1</a>, a new laptop from former Magic Leap employees, promises to solve those problems by pairing a computer with a set of lightweight AR glasses that look more comfortable to wear for long periods of time.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Priced at $1,700, Spacetop is basically a keyboard with an attached set of glasses. There is no display, but there is a top case that the glasses can be stored in when the device is not in use. Videos featuring the device show users typing on the keyboard while viewing a set of AR windows that are placed around them.
<br/>

The Spacetop runs SpaceOS, which the company says is a spatial operating system built for productivity. It focuses on web tasks, which provides content without the company having to recruit developers [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-06-04 15:22:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Popular Mac app Bartender appears to have been quietly sold approximately two months ago, with neither the prior owner nor the current owner providing customers or potential customers with information on the sale.

The transaction came to light after some Reddit users saw a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1d7zjv8/bartender_5_not_safe_anymore_warning_from/">warning from MacUpdater</a> letting them know that the company behind Bartender had been silently replaced. MacUpdater warned users that updates to the app from version 5.0.52 could be potentially unsafe due to the lack of transparency surrounding the situation.

Bartender's new owners replied to the Reddit thread and confirmed that Bartender had been acquired, but did not explain why customers had not been notified nor why there had been a certi [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-06-04 14:20:59-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple could soon launch its annual Back to School promotion for university students in the United States and Canada, based on ads that have been popping up on social networks.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-851334" height="1224" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/2022-back-to-school-apple-feature.jpg" width="2178"/>
<br/>
On Instagram, Apple is promoting Macs to college and university students. The ad in question depicts a Back to School image with the following text: "Buy Mac for university or college with education savings. Plus get a gift card for up to $200." The screenshot of the ad is from a Canadian user, and that price point suggests we will see the same $150 discount in the United States that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/06/apple-launches-2023-back-to-school-promotion/">provided last year</a>.

            Uber appears to be planning to offer mini games that can be played within its <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/uber-request-a-ride/id368677368">iPhone app</a>, according to hidden code in the app.

<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/">Aaron Perris</a> discovered several references to the ability to load games in the latest version of the Uber app, released on Monday. One line of code says that the gaming feature will require an internet connection.
<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear when Uber plans to make the mini games available to the public, and there is no guarantee that the feature will launch. No further details are known at this time, beyond the new lines of code added to the app, so we cannot confirm if the games will be available for free or require in-app purcha [...]<br>

            Folium has become the first Nintendo 3DS emulator for the iPhone <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/folium/id6498623389">available in the App Store</a>, although there are some caveats to be aware of.

Foremost, this is the first Nintendo emulator on the App Store that costs money. Folium developer Jarrod Norwell is charging $4.99 for the app, which is a bold choice given that Nintendo recently sued the developers of Yuzu, a Nintendo Switch emulator that made a profit off a subscription-based "early access" tier.

            Apple is planning a major AI overhaul in iOS 18, but some new features are unlikely to work on older iPhones, even if they do appear on the new operating system's device compatibility list.

<br/>
Apple's initial AI roadmap for iOS 18 is said to come in two parts: Basic AI features that will be processed on-device, and more advanced capabilities that will require communication with Apple's servers.
<br/>
<br/>
At the heart of these features is a redesigned Siri. To that end, Apple engineers have had to rearchitect ‌Siri‌'s underlying software using large language models (LLMs), the algorithm that underpins generative AI.
