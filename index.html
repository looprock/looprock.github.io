            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-13 16:57:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is still working on a next-generation version of the Studio Display, and <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris discovered signs of the new display in Apple code.

<br/>
The upcoming Studio Display 2 has a codename of J427, and references to J427 were tucked away in software code that Apple didn't mean to publish. Rumors suggest that the next-generation Studio Display will come out in early 2026, so it makes sense that Apple is testing it now.
<br/>
<br/>
We don't know a lot about the next-generation Apple display, but it is possible it will use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-mini-led-studio-display/">mini-LED backlighting</a>. If the Studio Display does indeed adopt mini-LED technology, we can expect improved brightness, a higher contrast ratio, and better color quality.

            Apple is working on a next-generation version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> (codename J510/J511) that features an A19 chip, according to information found in code that Apple mistakenly shared.

<br/>
It looks like the next-generation ‌iPad mini‌ will get the A19 Pro chip that Apple plans to use in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> models. 
<br/>
<br/>
Apple is developing the A19 chips for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> series that's set to come out this September. The Pro version of the A19 will have more GPU cores than the standard A19, and rumors suggest there will also be an in-between version that's a binned A19 Pro with one fewer GPU core.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The upcoming Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch Ultra 3, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> 3 will have an updated S11 system in package (SiP), but it may not bring much in the way of processor performance improvements.
<br/>

<br/>
Apple accidentally leaked some internal information about the upcoming chip, and it turns out it will have the same T8310 architecture as the S9 and S10 chips in the Series 9 and Series 10 Apple Watch models. 
<br/>
<br/>
It's not unusual for Apple to use the same architecture across multiple versions of the S-series chips for the Apple Watch. The S6, S7, and S8 chips all had the same core technology. 
<br/>
<br/>
The S9 and S10 chips use two "Sawtooth" performance cores like the A16 Bionic chip, so while it is older technology, it's still a lot of pow [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's software engineers are testing an internal version of iOS 26.4, according to the <em>MacRumors</em> visitor logs this week.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005033" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/iOS-26-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
iOS 26.4 is expected to be released in March or April next year, so the software update is still many months away. However, Apple develops both "Fall" and "Spring" versions of iOS each year, with work on both iOS 26.0 and iOS 26.4 underway.
<br/>
<br/>
There are two expected iOS 26.4 features so far, with more to follow.

Apple first released the MacBook Air with the M1 chip in November 2020, as one of the first Macs with an Apple silicon chip, instead of an Intel processor. The configuration being sold for $599 includes the M1 chip, 256GB of storage, and 8GB of RAM, with Gold, Silver, and Space Gray color options all available as of this writing.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Rumors continue to surface about Apple launching an affordable MacBook as early as this year.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1008940" height="1508" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/Low-Cost-MacBook-Feature-A18-Pro.jpg" width="2680"/>
<br/>
Below, we recap all of the reports and rumors so far.
<br/>
<br/>
Taiwanese supply chain publication <em>DigiTimes</em> expects the laptop to have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/11/new-12-9-inch-macbook-launch-this-year-599-price/"><strong>starting price of between $599 and $699</strong></a> in the United States.
<br/>
<br/>
The publication said the lower-cost MacBook will be equipped with a <strong>12.9-inch display</strong>, and a version of the <strong>A18 Pro chip</strong> that debuted in the iPhone 16 Pro models last year. It would become the first Mac to ever use an A-series chip from an iPhone.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-13 08:05:16-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, Apple has a helpful new feature that notifies you when your iPhone's camera lens needs cleaning – something Android devices have offered for years. Here's how to turn on this smart notification system.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1014400" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/clean-back-camera-hint.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
Whenever your iPhone's camera is active, iOS 26 monitors the incoming light for signs of reduced clarity or smudging that could indicate a dirty lens. When triggered, you'll see a discrete alert suggesting you clean your camera lens to improve image quality.
<br/>
<br/>
To benefit from the feature, you'll need an iPhone running iOS 26 (currently in beta). It's currently unclear which models support Lens Cleaning Hints, but you can check by looking for the following toggle:
<br/>
<ol><li>Open <strong>Settings</strong> on your iPhone.</li>
<br/>
<li>Scroll down and tap <strong>Camera</strong>.</li>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Netflix appears to have finished deploying its redesigned interface for Apple TV with version 3.0 of the app now available, bringing a months-long rollout that began with other TV platforms earlier this year to a close. Netflix has been testing a redesigned version of its TV app since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/netflix-tv-app-redesign/">last year</a>, and the new look is a notable departure from the previous design.

<br/>
There is a new home page that has a streamlined, modern design, and Netflix designed it to put content front and center. The redesigned interface loses the left-hand sidebar navigation that Netflix has used since 2018 and replaces it with a top menu bar that relocates Search, Home, Shows, Movies, Games, and My Netflix.
