            If you open up Spotify's desktop app on a Mac or PC today, things should look a lot more "mobile." That's because the company has redesigned the "Your Library" and "Now Playing" interfaces to make them more aligned with Spotify's smartphone app.

"Your Library" is now located in the sidebar to let you access saved music and podcasts. Spotify says its research has shown that the new library helps users save time by providing a better overview, while making it easier to switch between playlists.  Users can also now move and pin the playlists in the Library, as well as drop songs into the editable listed playlists.

Elsewhere, the "Now Playing" view takes up the right-hand side of the app, showing the currently playing song or podcast. &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-06-20/spotify-desktop-experien [...]<br>

But along with the promise of increased productivity from new code generation tools comes increased risks. Here are a few guidelines that may help minimize the risks while providing productivity benefits.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In this chapter we have to ask ourselves whether, in any sense at all, there is such a thing as matter. Is there a table which has a certain intrinsic nature, and continues to exist when I am not looking, or is the table merely a product of my imagination, a dream-table in a very prolonged dream? This question is of the greatest importance. For if we cannot be sure of the independent existence of objects, we cannot be sure of the independent existence of other people's bodies, and therefore still less of other people's minds, since we have no grounds for believing in their minds except such as are derived from observing their bodies. Thus if we cannot be sure of the independent existence of objects, we shall be left alone in a desert—it may be that the whole outer world is nothing but a dream, and that we alone exist.<br>

Understanding these elements and how they relate to each other is crucial for tasks such as video summarization and highlights detection, content-based video retrieval, dubbing quality assessment, and video editing.
