Available in version 25.25.74 of WhatsApp, the feature allows you to long press on any message in a conversation thread and select a new "Remind me" option in the popup menu.

Autonomous reasoning, access to the oracle, comprehensive code editing, and complex task execution. That's nearly verbatim from their homepage, but it's also exactly what Adam has experienced.

Overall, the iPhone 18 Pro models will feature a similar design as the iPhone 17 Pro models, <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/Q4WIggihJ">according to Digital Chat Station</a>, a previously-accurate leaker with more than three million followers on Chinese social media platform Weibo.

<br/>
In a post today, the leaker said the devices will have the same rear camera system design as the iPhone 17 Pro models, with a "plateau" housing three lenses in a triangular arrangement. He also expects the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max to have the same 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch display sizes used since the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max.
