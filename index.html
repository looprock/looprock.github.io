First, just like the new iMac, the base-model Mac mini with the M4 chip starts with 16GB of RAM, which is double the 8GB of RAM included in the equivalent previous-generation model.

            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> received a major update today, with Apple introducing a slimmed down design that shaves more than two inches off of the size so it takes up less space on a desktop or in a rack.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-mini/">M4 Mac mini</a> has an overhauled design that adds more ports in a slimmed down package, and to make everything fit, Apple needed a new place for the power button.

<br/>
As it turns out, the power button for the device is located on the bottom, so as <a href="https://x.com/ClassicII_MrMac/status/1851296326278918511">Mr. Macintosh</a> pointed out, you'll need to tip the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> up in order to turn it on (or off, using the physical button).
<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been criticized for questionable button and port placement with other devices <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/magic-mouse-usb-c-port-on-bottom/">such as the Magic Mouse</a>, but accessing the power button is probably not something most peop [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple dropped a surprise today with the announcement of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/apple-announces-redesigned-mac-mini/">new redesigned Mac mini</a> when it revealed that the M4 Pro model comes with three Thunderbolt 5 ports, making it the first Mac to support the next-generation connectivity standard.

<br/>
The newest specification of Thunderbolt offers 80 Gb/s of bi-directional bandwidth, and with Bandwidth Boost it will provide up to 120 Gb/s, enabling triple the maximum bandwidth of Thunderbolt 4 for an optimal display experience. 
<br/>
<br/>
Given that the current 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M3 Pro and M3 Max chips only support the older protocol, you can almost consider it a given that Apple's upcoming MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max will support Thunderbolt 5.

            Apple just unveiled the first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> redesign in over a decade. The previous major updates to the device were the transition to Apple silicon in 2020 and the option of a Pro-grade chip in 2023, so how does the latest model compare to its two immediate predecessors?

<br/>
The new ‌Mac mini‌ looks dramatically different to previous models thanks to a markedly smaller enclosure and two front USB-C ports, but it is also much more powerful thanks to the M4 and M4 Pro chips.

It was already pretty obvious that Apple plans to announce new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips this week, after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-promises-two-more-mac-announcements/">promised multiple Mac-related announcements this week</a>.

The paywalled report said this iPhone 17 model has already passed an early development stage, as Apple evaluates whether India-based engineers can develop iPhone prototypes that match the quality of those built at its California headquarters. Apple's goal is to start developing new iPhones as early as possible in locations closer to where final assembly takes place, which could result in lower operating costs for the company.

            Say you've captured a stunning sunset at the beach, but there's a trash can ruining the foreground. Or maybe you've taken the perfect family portrait, only to later realize there's a stranger in the background. With iOS 18.1's new Clean Up tool, Apple aims to make such photo frustrations a thing of the past. Here's how it works.

<br/>
Clean Up uses Apple Intelligence to analyze your photos and intelligently remove unwanted elements while preserving the natural look of your images. Granted it's not quite as powerful as desktop editing tools, but it brings impressive object removal capabilities right to your iPhone, letting you fix photo distractions in seconds rather than spending time and money on complex editing software.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iPhone exports from India reached nearly $6 billion in the six months through September, representing a 33% increase compared to the same period last year, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-29/apple-ships-6-billion-of-iphones-from-india-in-big-china-shift">Bloomberg</a></em>.
