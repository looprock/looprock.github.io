            <b>Summary:</b><br>

<br/>
Of course, things can always change before the software makes its way to the general iPhone-owning public, but here are five new things iOS 26 can do on the Lock Screen as of the current developer beta.

WhatsApp <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/helping-you-find-more-channels-and-businesses-on-whatsapp">announced</a> on Monday it will display ads through three new features, all contained within the Updates tab. Users will see promoted content in Status updates, discover promoted channels, and encounter subscription-based channel content.
<br/>
<br/>
The ads won't appear in personal chats or use encrypted message content for targeting. Instead, WhatsApp said it will rely on basic information like location, language, and channel follows to serve relevant ads.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iPhone sales climbed 15% year-over-year during April and May, signaling Apple's strongest two-month performance for the period since the pandemic, according to preliminary data from Counterpoint Research's <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/report/market-pulse-early-look-oem-sales-may-2025">Market Pulse Global Monthly Smartphone Sales Report</a>.

<br/>
The growth was driven mainly by the United States and China, Apple's two largest markets. Both regions returned to positive year-over-year growth after three years of declines during what is typically a less seasonal period. China sales were particularly notable, with Apple capturing the top spot in May. It's quite the turnaround, after Apple only recently sustained market share losses to Huawei and other local mobile vendors.

The analyst expects both the Apple Watch Series 11 and Apple Watch Ultra 3 to arrive this year (likely alongside the new iPhone 17 lineup, if previous launches are anything to go by), according to his latest product roadmap shared with investors.
<br/>
<br/>
It's been a long wait for Ultra fans. Apple skipped updating the rugged smartwatch entirely in 2024, choosing instead to simply add a black titanium color option to the existing Apple Watch Ultra 2. That means it will have been nearly two years when September rolls around since we've seen any meaningful changes to the Ultra lineup.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has lost a legal challenge in the Netherlands after a Dutch court ruled that the company abused its dominant market position by imposing restrictive payment terms on dating app developers (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/dutch-court-confirms-apple-abused-dominant-position-dating-apps-2025-06-16/">Reuters</a></em>).

<br/>
<br/>
The ruling was issued earlier today by the Rotterdam District Court, confirming a 2021 decision by the Dutch Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM), which found that Apple violated European Union competition laws by forcing dating app developers to use its proprietary in-app payment system, prohibiting them from directing users to alternative payment methods, and charging commissions of up to 30% on transactions.
