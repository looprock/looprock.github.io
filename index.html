            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Introduced in iOS 16, Live Activities changed the way users interact with their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. Instead of getting multiple notifications when tracking a delivery or a sports score, for example, users see a single, dynamically updating Live Activity with real-time information right on their Lock Screen.

Starting in watchOS 11, when a Live Activity begins on your ‌iPhone‌, it now automatically shows on your Apple Watch at the top of the Smart Stack, allowing you to keep tabs on it just by raising your wrist.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-06-13 03:05:09-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iPadOS 18, Apple has redesigned the tab bar experience in apps like Clock, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news-plus/">Apple News</a>. Previously, tabs sat at the bottom of the standard app interface. When in portrait orientation, tab bars now sit at the top of the app interface to be closer to other navigation controls.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Apple says having the tab bar at the top of the app and between other navigational controls reduces the amount of horizontal and vertical space used up by the interface, and allows users to focus more on the content. 
<br/>
<br/>
To accompany the new tab bars, sidebars in apps have also been updated to help users navigate apps and provide quick access to top-level destinations.

When enabled, Game Mode optimizes the gaming experience by giving the game the highest priority access to your ‌iPhone‌'s processor, while lowering usage for background tasks.

Apple says Game Mode also improves the responsiveness of connected AirPods and game controllers by reducing input latency and audio latency.

            Alongside its Apple Intelligence feature set, Apple on Monday announced a partnership with OpenAI that will allow Siri to access ChatGPT directly in iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia to provide better responses in relevant situations.

iOS 18 allows the Action button to be assigned to one of the dozens of controls available in the new Control Center gallery, allowing the Action button to invoke Dark Mode, Airplane Mode, Personal Hotspot, and more. Options like Low Power Mode and Orientation Lock do not appear to be available as of iOS 18 beta 1, but the Shortcut action already allows the Action button to be assigned to those options if desired.

Safari's headline feature in macOS 15 is something called Highlights, which aims to make it easier to discover information on the web.

<br/>
As of writing this, Highlights does not appear to work outside of the United States, so it is likely to be region-specific at this early state. However, there are other changes to Safari that are live [...]<br>

            Apple's stock price continues to surge following its WWDC keynote this week, where it introduced an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-generative-personal-ai-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">Apple Intelligence suite of AI features</a> coming to the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. In intraday trading today, Apple overtook Microsoft to become the world's most valuable company again, but the two tech giants may trade places throughout the day.

            Apple in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> has added a new multicolor swatch to the Font &amp; Color customization options on the Lock Screen, so now you can display the time in rainbow colors against your chosen wallpaper.

<br/>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-06-12 04:21:43-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, Apple has introduced a new window tiling management feature that aims to make it easy to arrange open windows into a layout that works best for you. 
<br/>

<br/>
PC users have had tiling since at least Windows 7 and Aero Snap, and if you've ever used those, the new window tiling feature in ‌macOS Sequoia‌ will be familiar. In the absence of the feature, Mac users have relied on several third-party tools like Magnet, Moom, and Rectangle to achieve similar results, but as things stand, in beta 1, window management in macOS still needs some work before it can approach the utility of those apps.
