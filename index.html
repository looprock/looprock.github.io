James Weldon was accustomed every season to send his whalers both to the Arctic regions beyond Behring Straits, and to the Antarctic Ocean below Tasmania and Cape Horn; and the "Pilgrim," although one of the smallest, was one of the best-going vessels of its class; her sailing-powers were splendid, and her rigging was so adroitly adapted that with a very small crew she might venture without risk within sight of the impenetrable ice-fields of the southern hemisphere: under skilful guidance she could dauntlessly thread her way amongst the drifting ice-bergs that, lessened though they were by perpetual shocks and undermined by warm currents, made their way northwards as far as the parallel of New Zeal [...]<br>

            TypeScript is a programming language which is presented as a package in Node.js ecosystem.

By using this package, you can:
1. Make concise (absolute) imports in your project.
2. Create custom types for your request & response payloads.
3. Use intellisense & type checking features to make less syntax mistakes in your code.

Custom types also act as a documentation for your payload data - you won't have to check with your external collections/tools for this anymore!<br>
