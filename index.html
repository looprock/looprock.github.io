            <b>Published:</b> 2023-09-22 15:56:18-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers are able to individually repair the bottom-right microphone on the lower-end iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, according to information obtained by <em>MacRumors</em> today from multiple sources.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910412" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-USB-C-Port-Event-Still.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
The new procedure of replacing this microphone on its own should make these repairs cheaper for customers, and also less wasteful, as part of Apple's focus on environmental responsibility. As for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, and other iPhone models, repairing this microphone still requires replacing the entire mid-frame chassis. 
<br/>
<br/>
For repairs of all other microphones on iPhones, including next to the earpiece and rear camera, a mid-frame replacement is still required.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup</div> [...]<br>

            Law enforcement officers rarely care about enforcing traffic laws. Moving violations may produce a little extra revenue for the city or state, but it doesn&#8217;t do much for the officers performing the stops. Pretextual stops? The leveraging of any perceived moving violation in hopes of performing a vehicle search? That&#8217;s where the money is, thanks [&#8230;]<br>

            In a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207123">support document</a> updated today, Apple indicates that fingerprints might "temporarily alter the color" of the titanium frame on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.
