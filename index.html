            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-17 07:09:19-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is set to "significantly change" the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s design language later this year, according to a Weibo leaker.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-990003" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-17-Roundup-Feature-2.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
In a new post, the user known "<a href="https://weibo.com/u/6048569942">Digital Chat Station</a>" said that the ‌iPhone‌'s design is "starting to change significantly" this year. The "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>" reportedly features a "horizontal, bar-shaped" design on the rear, likely referring to an elongated camera bump. On the other hand, the Pro models purportedly adopt a "large horizontal matrix design."

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-17 07:05:00-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In macOS, the Hot Corners feature turns each of the four corners of your screen into a designated action, allowing you to quickly access certain functions built into the system, such as Mission Control, Notification Center, the Screen Saver, QuickNote, and more. Many Mac users would agree, there's something satisfying about bringing up these commonly used functions with a simple, swift cursor movement. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990363" height="2064" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/hot-corner-controls-macos.jpg" width="2752"/>
<br/>
What isn't so satisfying, however, is accidentally triggering a Hot Corner, which can lead to all kinds of unintended desktop behavior - like application windows flying all over the place. This can happen when you lose track of the mouse cursor, or when you're working within the confines of a smaller MacBook screen. Thankfully, there's a way to tame wayward Hot Corners using modifier keys. Here's how.

            Apple's upcoming budget iPhone might not be called the iPhone SE 4 after all, with <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman lending credence to rumors of a potential name change for the device being unveiled this Wednesday.

In his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-16/apple-and-meta-are-set-to-battle-over-new-area-humanoid-robots-m77mwid3">Power On newsletter</a>, Gurman mentions Apple CEO Tim Cook's recent social media announcement about a new product unveiling on February 19, in which Cook teased the "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-launch-february-19/">newest member of the family</a>." According to Gurman, this phrasing seems to imply that Apple plans to position the device as a fresh addition to the lineup rather than a continuation of the SE series.

            Apple will bring its next-generation M5 chip to the MacBook Pro in the fall, followed by the iPad Pro in the first half of 2026, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-16/apple-and-meta-are-set-to-battle-over-new-area-humanoid-robots-m77mwid3"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.</a>

<br/>
Gurman's latest claim flips the previously expected order of devices to transition from M4 to M5 chips, which was based on last year's M4 product launch order. Apple first introduced its M4 chip in an updated iPad Pro in May 2024, followed by the MacBook Pro in October, but it sounds like Apple will deviate from that timeline this time around.

Back in 2022, Gurman said software engineering was "already underway" to display ads in the Apple Maps app, but Apple did not move forward with the idea at the time. Today, he said Apple is "giving this notion more thought" again.

<br/>
This time around, he said Apple has yet to start engineering work, so ads in the Apple Maps app might still be a ways away.

Jobs <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2006/01/10Apple-Introduces-MacBook-Pro/">announced</a> the ‌MacBook Pro‌ at the Macworld Conference &amp; Expo in 2006. It was the first Mac notebook to transition from PowerPC processors to Intel's Core Duo architecture. Designed to be an Intel-based replacement for the PowerBook line, the ‌MacBook Pro‌ took a similar aluminum chassis and added an Intel Core processor, a webcam, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> power connector.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Earlier today, some Netflix users in the United States began seeing Netflix content in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app's Continue Watching queue, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/14/netflix-shows-in-apple-tv-app-for-some-users/">which prompted speculation</a> that Netflix was rolling out ‌Apple TV‌ integration.

<br/>
As it turns out, Netflix content showing up in new places in the ‌Apple TV‌ interface was a bug, and Netflix is not introducing expanded ‌Apple TV‌ functionality. In a statement to <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/613307/netflix-apple-tv-app-support-mistake">The Verge</a></em>, a Netflix spokesperson confirmed that temporary support for the Continue Watching feature was an error, and it has been rolled back.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Instagram is testing a "dislike" button that can be used for comments, Instagram head Adam Mosseri <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/DGD12NZPjwb">confirmed today</a>. The dislike button is designed to give people a "private" way to signal that they don't feel good about a particular comment.

<br/>
Mosseri says that the feature is just a test at the current time, but the goal is to help "make comments more friendly." If the test goes well, the dislike signal could be integrated into comment ranking to move disliked comments lower down in the comment section of an Instagram post or reel.

There is no dislike count for posts, nor can the post creator or other commenters see if a user has disliked a post. Dislikes are an internal signal hidden from users. In a statement to <em>TechCrunch</em>, an Instagram  [...]<br>
