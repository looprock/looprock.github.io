Apple first entered Major League Baseball in March 2022 with a seven-year agreement valued at roughly $85 million per year, which granted it exclusive global streaming rights to two Friday night games each week on ‌Apple TV‌+. The deal was originally scheduled to run through 2029, but <em>Yahoo Sports</em>' Kendall Baker <a href="https://x.com/kendallbaker/status/1957930701086679514">now says</a> that Apple has exercised an early opt-out provision, allowing the company to end its involvement before the contract's planned expiration.

The aluminum enclosure features a finned heatsink design that means no fans are required to maintain performance. Bus-powered through its included USB4 cable, the drive also works across multiple platforms including PCs, iPad Pro, Chromebooks, and Surface devices.
