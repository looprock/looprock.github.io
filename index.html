            <b>Published:</b> 2024-01-04 10:29:07-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple last night stopped signing the iOS 17.2 update, preventing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users from downgrading to that version of iOS going forward. iOS 17.2 is no longer being signed following the December 19 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/19/apple-releases-ios-17-2-1/">release of iOS 17.2.1</a>, an update that brought bug fixes.

<br/>
It is not unusual that iOS 17.2 is no longer being signed. Apple routinely stops signing older versions of iOS after new releases in order to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date and to prevent users from downgrading to older, less secure versions of the ‌iPhone‌ operating system.

            Samsung this week announced its 2024 Unpacked event, which is set to be held on January 17 in San Jose, California.

Samsung's event announcement teases a "new era of mobile AI," so it's safe to say that Samsung's new smartphones will have enhanced AI capabilities on par with ChatGPT and other AI products. In fact, Samsung says that the new Galaxy S series will feature the "most intelligent mobile experience yet."

Galaxy S24 rumors have suggested that the high-end Ultra model will include a 200-megapixel <a href="https://twitter.com/universeice/status/1736910942318084347">AI-enhanced camera</a> that is able to identify 12 kinds of objects and optimize them for improved image qual [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple will likely acquire the fitness company Peloton this year, a new hedge fund manager forecast claims.

<br/>
Deepwater Asset Management's <a href="https://deepwatermgmt.com/deepwaters-2024-predictions/">annual forecast</a> for 2024 (via <em><a href="https://connectthewatts.com/2024/01/03/deepwater-predicts-apple-acquisition-of-peloton/">Connect the Watts</a></em>) says that Apple is likely to acquire Peloton sometime this year. The move would help Apple bolster its Fitness+ subscription service, adding workout equipment to compliment the Apple Watch and its existing activity tracking software. Absorbing Peloton's subscriber base of three-million users would ostensibly add about $1.7 billion to Apple's subscription revenue and line up with its continued investment in health and wellness, the company claims.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Three hours after releasing the second betas of iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3, Apple has pulled the updates from the Developer Center and over the air, meaning they are no longer available to download and install.

<br/>
Apple has removed the iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 betas after a number of people reported that the software is bricking devices. According to reports on <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-3-beta-2-bug-fixes-changes-and-improvements.2415339/">the <em>MacRumors</em> forums</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/BrandonButch/status/1742628347002204350">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@_inside/111693591558795389">Mastodon</a>, some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owners who updated found their devices stuck in a boot loop.

            Last month, many Apple Music subscribers reported that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/04/apple-music-add-playlist-songs-to-library-bug/">"Add Playlist Songs" setting was broken</a> on the iPhone, iPad, and sometimes the Mac.

<br/>
Fortunately, it appears that Apple quickly addressed the bug with a server-side fix, and users are no longer impacted by this issue. Given it was a server-side fix, users do not need to update their devices to a newer software version for it to apply.
