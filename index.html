            Popular repair site iFixit today disassembled one of Apple's new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-mini/">M4 Mac mini</a> machines for a teardown video that gives us a more complete look at the inside of the device.

<br/>
Compared to the prior version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, the M4 model is densely packed with little space between components, which is how Apple slimmed down the size so much. The ‌M4 Mac mini‌ measures in at 5x5 inches, down from 7.5x7.5 inches, a size reduction that makes a major difference.
<br/>
<br/>
The power supply module is a board that extends across the top of the case, a design that Apple has previously used for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>. The power supply normally takes up a lot of space, so that's how Apple shrunk it down without compromising performance.

The Smart Lock Ultra is one-third the size of previous Nuki models. This has been achieved through a new built-in battery design that eliminates the need for a bulky battery compartment, according to the company.

            Apple TV+ today shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceYm0eDw7tg">recap video</a> for the first season of "Silo. The hit series returns for a second season starting later this week.
<br/>
<br/>
Warning: The video contains major spoilers, obviously.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
"Silo" follows the last 10,000 people on Earth, all of whom live in a massive underground bunker to escape the seemingly toxic and deadly world outside. The people are unaware of why the silo was built, and those who seek the truth face deadly consequences. Rebecca Ferguson stars as Juliette Nichols, an engineer who attempts to unravel the mysteries surrounding the silo following a loved one's murder. The sci-fi series is based on Hugh Howey's best-selling book trilogy "Wool." Ferguson and Howey both serve as executive producers.

The 10-episode second season of "Silo" begins this Friday, November 15, and one new episode will follow every Friday through January 17.

The expensive price tag is partly due to the fact that luxury company Assouline is only selling 1,500 copies of the book, each with a hand-printed number.
