            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Popular audio company Sonos recently updated its U.S. privacy policy to make a small but notable change that seemingly puts customer data at risk. As noted by Louis Rossmann (via <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178433/sonos-privacy-policy-customer-data-controversy">The Verge</a></em>), the new Sonos privacy policy removes a line about not selling customer data.

<br/>
In the 2023 version of its privacy policy, Sonos had this sentence: "We do not and will not sell your personal data to third parties." The statement has been removed from the 2024 version of the privacy policy in the United States, though it is still present in privacy policies in other countries.

Emergency SOS now supports live video, which means once the SOS feature is activated, streaming video and recorded media can be sent to emergency personnel.

Video is sent over a secure connection to the emergency dispatcher. The option could allow those in emergency situations to send key information for location purposes, to assess injury or risk, or to be us [...]<br>

            One of the Apple Intelligence features coming in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> is Genmoji, which will allow <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users to use AI to generate all-new emoji characters based on text input.

Emoji are not images, but are instead pictographs that are encoded in the Unicode Standard and rendered by each platform. Emoji are added by the Unicode Consortium, which raised some questions about how Apple's Genmoji solution will work.

<br/>
In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> and earlier, there has been no way to select a home hub, and ‌HomeKit‌ has picked randomly.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple plans to overhaul the design of its TestFlight app that is available to developers for beta testing their apps, and the updated design was highlighted in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkeUvZ4NRhg">WWDC session on App Store Connect</a>.

<br/>
TestFlight in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> features a new invitation experience that will better showcase the app by highlighting key information including app name and icon, screenshots, developer name, build expiration date, and app description.

            Apple today shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkafMX3viGE">Beats Solo Buds unboxing video</a> on YouTube, providing a closer look at the wireless earbuds before they launch next week.

<br/>
Priced at $79.99, the Beats Solo Buds feature up to 18 hours of battery life, a USB-C carrying case, and Find My support on both iOS and Android. However, they lack active noise cancellation, and the carrying case does not have a built-in battery and can only charge the earbuds when a USB-C cable is connected to an external power source.
<br/>
<br/>
More details about the earbuds can be found in our initial <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-buds-announced/">coverage of the Beats Studio Buds announcement</a> back in late April.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple this week previewed a new system that will allow iPhone users who update to iOS 18 to use Apple Pay in any desktop web browser, such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and others. The computer running the browser can even be a Windows PC.

<br/>
Any website that implements the latest version of Apple Pay will support this new system. When a customer checks out with Apple Pay in a desktop browser other than Safari, a code will appear on the screen that can be scanned in the Camera app on an iPhone running iOS 18 or later, allowing them to complete the purchase on the iPhone.

Overall, there is not a whole lot new for CarPlay on iOS 18, with changes seemingly limited to the Messages and Settings apps so far.

Below, we recap everything new for CarPlay on iOS 18.

iOS 18 adds contact photos next to names in the Messages app, making it easier to identify conversations at a glance.

            First introduced in April, spatial Personas in Apple Vision Pro are designed to feel as if they are in the same physical space, and to enhance the experience, the lifelike avatars will soon be able to interact directly with each other using some new gestures in visionOS 2.

<br/>
Previewed at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/07/vision-pro-spatial-personas/">WWDC last year</a>, spatial Personas allow Vision Pro users to "break out of the familiar FaceTime tile and feel more present, like they are gathered in the same physical space," according to Apple. They feature a transparent background and are able to show body language and additional movement such as hand gestures for a more lifelike experience.
