<p>The Feature Systems team at Etsy is responsible for the platform and services through which machine learning (ML) practitioners create, manage and consume feature data for their machine learning models. We recently made new real-time features available through our streaming feature platform, Rivulet, where we return things like “most recent add-to-carts.” While timeseries data itself wasn’t new to our system, these newer features from our streaming feature service would be the first timeseries inputs to be supplied to our ML models themselves to inform search, ads, and recommendations use cases.</p>
<p>Not too long after we made these features available to users for ML model training, we received a message from Harshal, an ML practitioner on Recommendations, warning us of "major problems" lying in wait.

"There's never been a wedding in this house," she said, half apologetically, to Mrs. Rachel Lynde. "When I was a child I heard an old minister say that a house was not a real home until it had been consecrated by a birth, a wedding and a death. We've had deaths here—my father and mother died here as well as Matthew; and we've even had a birth here. Long ago, just after we moved into this house, we had a married hired man for a little while, and his wife had a baby here. But there's never been a wedding before. It does seem so strange to think of Anne being married. In a way she just seems to me the little girl Matthew brought home here fourteen years ago. I can't realize that she's grown up.

<br/>
It's worth noting from the off that widgets can still be parked in Notification Center, but now they can also be dragged out onto the desktop. The first widget can be placed anywhere, then Apple provides placement guidance for subsequent widgets by displaying a widget-shaped outline, indicating where they can be snapped into position in relation to the others.
