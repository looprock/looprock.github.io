            AT&amp;T <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2025/wireless-account-lock.html">today said</a> that customers can activate Wireless Account Lock, a new feature that will prevent unauthorized changes to a wireless account. With Account Lock turned on, account changes like billing updates and wireless number transfers are disabled.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Account Lock will protect AT&amp;T users from SIM swapping, a technique that scammers employ to gain control of a smartphone user's phone number, and by extension, two-factor verification codes sent to that number. With SIM swapping, an attacker calls the carrier's support staff, pretends to be the smartphone user, and asks for a number transfer.

Postpaid AT&amp;T customers can activate Wireless Account Lock from the myAT&amp;T app. Locked features will not be accessible until th [...]<br>

The man was stuck above 10,000 feet on Snowmass Mountain, which is one of many snowy mountains in Colorado. It can be a dangerous hike due to the potential for rockfall and because of ice.

On the trip, the unnamed 53-year-old man summited the mountain and was using a technique called glissading to slide down the mountain. Sliding down a snow-covered mountain can result in injury, and the man suffered damage to his wrist that prevented him from continuing.

Trump this week said that he identified a buyer to purchase TikTok from ByteDance, and according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-30/tiktok-buyer-cited-by-trump-is-same-investor-group-as-before">Bloomberg</a></em>, Trump's pick is an investor consortium that includes Oracle, Blackstone, and Andreessen Horowitz.
