            On iPhone 15 models, iOS 18 will recommend that users set a particular charging limit for their device based on their recent usage habits, with the aim of potentially improving their iPhone battery's lifespan by reducing the time that the battery is fully charged.

All four iPhone 15 models feature a setting that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-15-battery-charging-limit/">prevents the devices from charging beyond 80%</a> while toggled on, and iOS 18 expands the feature by adding <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-introduces-more-charging-limits/">new 85%, 90%, and 95% charging limit options</a>. With the new limit options, iOS 18 now takes a proactive approach to improving battery longevity by recommending a specific charging limit to users via a notification.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> has added a new multicolor swatch to the Font &amp; Color customization options on the Lock Screen, so now you can display the time in rainbow colors against your chosen wallpaper.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Unlike the other color swatches, the multicolor option does not currently apply to widgets and the date, which turn white when the rainbow effect is applied. However, there's a good chance this is something Apple intends to implement but has not yet got around to doing so in the developer beta.
<br/>
<br/>
‌iOS 18‌ also allows users to change the two Flashlight and Camera shortcut buttons on the Lock Screen to an action of their choice for the first time.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-06-12 04:21:43-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, Apple has introduced a new window tiling management feature that aims to make it easy to arrange open windows into a layout that works best for you. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955093" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macos-15-tiling.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
PC users have had tiling since at least Windows 7 and Aero Snap, and if you've ever used those, the new window tiling feature in ‌macOS Sequoia‌ will be familiar. In the absence of the feature, Mac users have relied on several third-party tools like Magnet, Moom, and Rectangle to achieve similar results, but as things stand, in beta 1, window management in macOS still needs some work before it can approach the utility of those apps.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple introduced a new design for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app that replaces the Library and For You sections with a more integrated all-in-one view, and part of that redesign includes an overhauled Utilities section that makes it easier to find different types of images.

<br/>
Rather than being limited to Imports, Duplicates, Hidden, and Recently Deleted as in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, the Utilities section of the app has all of the following categories:
<br/>

            Apple updated the Battery section of the Settings app in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> to add a feature that lets you know if you charged your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> with a "slow" charger.

Periods of slow charging are shown with an orange bar in the portion of the Battery settings that show battery usage and charging over the past 24 hours or the past 10 days.

            Earlier this year, we <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/apple-id-to-apple-account-rebrand/">reported</a> that "Apple ID" would be renamed to "Apple Account," and this change has now been officially announced.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's stock price has crossed the $200 mark and reached a new all-time high in intraday trading, one day after the company unveiled its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-generative-personal-ai-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">Apple Intelligence suite of AI features</a> coming with iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia.

<br/>
Apple's stock price has split five times since the company went public, including on a 4-for-1 basis in 2020 most recently. This means that Apple's stock price would be over $45,000 today if it had never been split, and all other things being equal.

Generative AI has been a hot topic ever since ChatGPT debuted in 2022, and investors had been waiting for Apple to unveil its own plans for the technology.
