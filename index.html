            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has dealt a blow against spyware maker NSO Group and the Israeli firm's efforts to move Apple's lawsuit against it to its home country. Apple in November 2021 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/23/apple-sues-nso-group/">sued the group</a> and its parent company with the aim of holding it accountable for targeting Apple users with spyware used for surveillance purposes.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            X, formerly Twitter, now supports passkeys as a login option for iOS users in the United States, the company has <a href="https://x.com/Safety/status/1749881895641633080?s=20">announced</a>.

<br/>
Passkeys are both easier to use and more secure than passwords because they let users sign in to apps and sites the same way they unlock their devices: With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>, or a device passcode. Passkeys are also resistant to online attacks like phishing, making them more secure than things like SMS one-time codes.

<br/>
Apple integrated passkeys into iOS in 2022 with the launch of iOS 16, and it is also available in iPadOS 16.1 and later as well as macOS Ventura and later.

According to the report, indications suggest Apple has been focusing on "tackling the technological problem of running AI through mobile devices."
