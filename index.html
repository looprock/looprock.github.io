            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In the early to mid-1990s, Apple released a wide range of quirky and unique products, ranging from printers and digital cameras to a video game console and a PDA with a keyboard. Steve Jobs nixed the vast majority of these products upon his return to Apple in 1997, helping the company to regain its focus and avoid impending bankruptcy.

            Apple updated its vintage and obsolete <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102772">products list</a> to add several Macs, iPads, accessories, and more.

In his latest report on Apple's product roadmap for 2026, Gurman said the company is planning to launch its first new Mac external monitor since debuting the Apple Studio Display in 2022. 
<br/>
<br/>
The new version, internally code-named J427, "is currently slated for early 2026," alongside Macs with M5 chips, said Gurman.
<br/>
<br/>
Gurman in February <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/16/new-studio-display-per-mark-gurman/">reported</a> that Apple was "ramping up" work on a new Studio Display that "sho [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple in October 2024 overhauled its 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, adding M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips, Thunderbolt 5 ports on higher-end models, display changes, and more. That's quite a lot of updates in one go, but there is another major refresh coming to the MacBook Pro – although when it will arrive has now been thrown into doubt.

<br/>
According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/10/no-m5-macbook-pro-2025/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, Apple is rethinking its original plan to minimally refresh the MacBook Pro lineup with M5 chips later this year. Instead, the refreshed M5 models, offering only a small performance boost, are now expected to arrive in the first half of 2026.

Apple is said to have two versions of the entry-level 11-inch iPad in development, codenamed J581 and J582.

The current iPad 11 is available in 128, 256, and 512GB capacities.
