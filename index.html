            The European Commission has no plans to scrap the Digital Markets Act <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/25/apple-challenges-eu-digital-markets-act/">despite Apple's complaints</a> that the law causes a worse experience for European <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owners.

<br/>
In ‌iOS 26‌, you can copy just part of a text message, rather than having to copy the whole thing. It's useful if someone sends you a web link, an address, or something else where you only need to copy part of what you're sent.
<br/>
<br/>
To use the selective copy, long press on a text message and then tap on Select. From there, you can drag to choose exactly what you want to copy.

Those two roles being security and legal. The theory is that the security people are used to this kind of thing and have processes in place. Also, that they are narrowly focused on a handful of things. You need the lawyers for all the whacky IP stuff. Hopefully they focus most on licenses. I think what you probably want to avoid in the AI policy board is focusing on endless hypotheticals about what can go wrong and ways of preventing them.
