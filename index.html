            <b>Published:</b> 2024-07-24 08:44:18-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Taiwanese research firm TrendForce this week <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20240722-12228.html">said</a> it anticipates that Apple will begin releasing iPhones with quad-level cell (QLC) storage by 2026. This technology could pave the way for iPhones with 2TB of storage in the future.

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911430" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Lineup-Feature-White.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
QLC is a denser storage technology compared to the triple-level cell (TLC) technology used for storage chips in existing iPhones, and this would allow for higher storage capacity within the same physical footprint. In addition, QLC storage is typically less expensive than TLC in terms of price per gigabyte. However, one downside is that QLC storage typically offers slower read and write speeds compared to TLC storage.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple stands to benefit significantly from India's recent reduction in import duties on mobile phones and components, aimed at boosting local manufacturing and making high-end smartphones more affordable (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-budget-india-cuts-import-tax-smartphones-boost-apple-2024-07-23/">Reuters</a></em>).

<br/>
India has announced a 5% cut in import duties on mobile phones, printed circuit board assemblies (PCBAs), and mobile device chargers, reducing the rate from 20% to 15%. The move is expected to save Apple $35–50 million annually and supports the company's efforts to increase its manufacturing presence in India. Apple's assembly operations in the country, conducted through its partners like Foxconn, have grown significantly in recent years, with 14% of all iPh [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iPhone will adopt a new 1/2.6-inch 48MP Ultra Wide CMOS image sensor (CIS) made by Samsung as early as 2026, breaking Sony's years-long monopoly as Apple's CIS supplier, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

<br/>
Writing in a brief report <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1816057976358330824">published on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Kuo said Samsung has already established a dedicated team within its ranks to work on the camera components with a view to specifically supplying Apple. 
<br/>
<br/>
For years now, Apple has exclusively sourced CIS for its iPhones from Sony. However, recent developments suggest a strategic shift away from the Japanese supplier due to concerns about reliability and Apple's need to integrate new technologies into its camera system.
