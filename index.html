            It's taken this long, but in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, Apple has added support for multiple timers, and has also made it easy to manage several timers on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> with the introduction of labels.

<br/>
That's right. Believe it or not, iPhones have not included the ability to set multiple ongoing timers until now. In ‌iOS 17‌, the Clock app finally enables several timers to be set that will run down at the same time, allowing you to keep track of more than one thing, which is handy when cooking a meal that includes several dishes, for example.
<br/>
<br/>
Not only can you have several timers counting down at the same time, you can also label timers, which helps you identify each one in your timer list. That way, you'll [...]<br>

which conferences to attend.  Having to make attendance decisions regularly, I came up with the following criteria to help guide my decisions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Employer sales or strategic business purpose for my attendance
  </li><li>Density of community members that requires my attendance
  </li><li>Small enough that my attendance helps the event grow
  </li><li>Non-Postgres event that needs a highly-visible Postgres speaker
  </li><li>Geographically close to my home or another event

When asked how he uses the upcoming headset, Cook said he watched "the entire third season of 'Ted Lasso' on the Vision Pro," and admitted there are "some things I have access to that other people don't have access to, so I'm doing that, but that I can't talk to you about."

Cook went on to say that the challenges Apple has faced creating the headset are "more complex" than making something like the iPhone, so it requires "more innovation, not only in the development but also in the manufacturing."

<br/>
Prior to the launch of the latest ‌Apple TV‌ 4K, there were rumors that Apple would build ‌Find My‌ functionality into the ‌Siri‌ Remote. That didn't happen, but in its latest major software updates, Apple has introduced a new iPhone option that does essentially the same thing. 
<br/>
<br/>
In early September, Apple quietly released new firmware for its second and third-generation Siri Remotes. With the new firmware, tvOS 17, and iOS 17, if a ‌Siri‌ Remote becomes lost, the ‌Apple TV‌ remote control available in the Control Center on an ‌iPhone‌ can be used to locate the missing remote.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-09-18 07:45:39+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            TLDR: Roblox, a popular virtual platform, is under scrutiny for its exploitation of child labor and questionable business practices. British YouTuber Quintin Smith's investigations revealed that Roblox targets players aged 9 to 15 to create "experiences" (games) on the platform. Roblox takes a hefty 75.5% commission from developers, operates a closed economic system, and discourages fund withdrawals. Despite these practices, it claims not to be profitable, yet went public with a valuation of $41 billion. CEO Dave Baszucki's net worth is estimated at $8.3 billion. Roblox's platform capitalism fosters predatory behaviors and even has an in-game virtual stock market for NFT-like "collectibles." It's positioned to monetize the emerging metaverse, potentially concentrating power and repeating dark chapters in labor history. The metaverse's impact on labor and ethics remains uncertain, as powerful corporations embrace this evolving technology.<br>

In this context, a Swift-based iOS design system is discussed, starting with color and typography models. These models are integrated into the project via extensions and modifiers, creating a standardized button component. The ButtonKind enum defines button types, and the ButtonModifier customizes their appearance. The result is an easy-to-maintain, iOS-friendly design system using Swift and Pattern Factory for scalable, consistent UI development.<br>

            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> likely feels considerably lighter than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a>, not just due to the switch from stainless steel to titanium, but also a change to the device's moment of inertia, according to calculations by Dr. Drang's <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-facts-and-estimates/"><em>LeanCrew</em> blog</a>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Google currently offers no official repair procedure for the Pixel Watch, meaning that broken devices simply become e-waste (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23874281/google-pixel-watch-cracks-no-repairs-warranty"><em>The Verge</em></a>).

<br/>
This information was recently confirmed by Google spokesperson Bridget Starkey to <em>The Verge</em>. Starkey stated, "At this moment, we don't have any repair option for the Google Pixel Watch. If your watch is damaged, you can contact the Google Pixel Watch Customer Support Team to check your replacement options." Google Support chats add that the company "doesn't have any repair centers or service centers" for the Pixel Watch.

The device's lack of repair options stands in contrast to Google's approach with its Pixel phones, where it partners with iFixit to ens [...]<br>
