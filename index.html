In a <a href="https://support.setapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/13690464925212-About-Setapp-Mobile">support page</a>, MacPaw said Setapp Mobile is being closed because of app marketplaces' "still-evolving and complex business terms that don't fit Setapp's current business model," suggesting it was not profitable for the company.

<p>I can see how it happens. You get an app into production, it runs fine, and then you moveon to the next thing. Meanwhile, the version drifts into “End of Life” territory. OSS support ends (like way back in mid-2023 for the Spring version DaShaun mentioned).

            Apple's upcoming iPhone 17e will feature a Dynamic Island instead of a notch at the top of the screen, but unlike the rest of the iPhone 17 lineup, the display itself will still refresh at 60Hz, according to a known Weibo leaker.

<br/>
Apple made major improvements to the iPhone 17's display last year, introducing ProMotion display technology with up to a 120Hz refresh rate, similar to recent iPhone Pro models. 120Hz maximum refresh rates allow for smoother scrolling when viewing webpages and improvements for video, but it looks like the iPhone 17e is not getting the upgrade to keep costs down.

            Verizon is experiencing a major outage across the U.S. today, with hundreds of thousands of customers reporting issues with the network <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/">on the website Downdetector</a>.

iPhone users and others with Verizon service are generally unable to make phone calls, send text messages, or use data over 5G or LTE due to the outage. iPhone users may see "SOS" in the status bar, as the device cannot connect to Verizon's network.

<p>Analogously, Dell doesn’t define much at all (anything?) in the market despite how many apps and workloads run on Dell laptops, servers, etc. Neither does Cisco, etc.</p>
<p>In new, all-consuming tech categories, like AI, you have to chase the use case, deliver apps for it, and constantly churn out new features. And in AI, that’s currently a chat app.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>

The main body of the device will apparently use a revised titanium material that improves strength while reducing overall weight when compared with existing titanium ‌iPhone‌ frames, despite having virtually the same surface area.
