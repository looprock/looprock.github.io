            <b>Published:</b> 2024-11-16 09:45:33-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Earlier this month, we reported about some iPhone users <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/07/how-to-fix-iphone-notes-disappearing/">temporarily losing all of their notes</a> in the Notes app after accepting Apple's updated iCloud terms and conditions. Apple has now indirectly acknowledged this issue in a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/121669">new support document</a> that outlines steps to follow if your iCloud notes are not appearing on your iPhone, iPad, or Vision Pro.
<br/>

<br/>
Fortunately, the notes can be re-synced from iCloud. Apple's steps are pretty much identical to the ones we shared earlier this month:<blockquote>If your iCloud notes aren't appearing on your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Vision Pro, follow these steps.

<br/>
1. Open the Settings app and tap your name.

            Apple today added a few older iPhone and Apple Watch models to the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102772">vintage and obsolete products list</a> on its website.

<br/>
Apple has now classified the iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone XS Max as "vintage" worldwide. Apple considers a device to be "vintage" once five years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale. Apple and Apple Authorized Service Providers sometimes offer repairs for vintage devices, but only if parts remain available.

Note that if you have an iPhone 6s Plus with 32GB of storage, that particular configuration was already classified as "obsolete" prior to today.

Apple has yet to add the smaller iPhone XS and iPhone 6s models to the "vintage" list.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WeChat is introducing passkey support for its iOS app, allowing users outside of China to sign in to the country's dominant messaging platform using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>, or their device passcode instead of traditional passwords.

<br/>
Apple introduced passkeys in iOS 16 to provide users with a more secure and convenient authentication method than entering a password. Passkeys offer enhanced security by reducing common risks associated with traditional passwords, such as phishing attacks and credential theft. Since authentication occurs directly on the user's device using biometric data or their device passcode, there are no passwords to compromise or intercept.

            The award-winning Apple TV+ sci-fi series "Silo" is finally back, after nearly a year-and-a-half wait. The first episode of the second season is now available on Apple's streaming service, and one new episode will follow every Friday through January 17.

<br/>
"Silo" follows the last 10,000 people on Earth, all of whom live in a massive underground bunker to escape the seemingly toxic and deadly world outside. The people are unaware of why the silo was built, and those who seek the truth face deadly consequences. Rebecca Ferguson stars as Juliette Nichols, an engineer who attempts to unravel the mysteries surrounding the silo following a loved one's murder. The sci-fi series is based on Hugh Howey's best-selling book trilogy "Wool." Ferguson and Howey both serve as executive producers.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-11-14 16:19:32-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macbook-pro/">M4 MacBook Pro</a> models feature quantum dot display technology, according to display analyst Ross Young. Apple used a quantum dot film instead of a red KSF phosphor film, a change that provides more vibrant, accurate color results.

<br/>
Young says that Apple has opted for KSF for prior <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> models because it doesn't use toxic element cadmium (typical for quantum dot) and is more efficient (and thus less expensive).

            Every year, the Unicode Consortium decides on new emoji characters that will be coming to smartphones and other devices in the future, and this week, the Unicode 17 emoji recommendations came out [<a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2024/24226r-esr-report-q4-2024.pdf">PDF</a>].

<br/>
Eight new emoji characters have been proposed, including hairy creature (like Bigfoot), distorted face, fight cloud, apple core, orca, trombone, landslide, and treasure chest. There are also skin tone variations for a number of existing emoji like ballet dancer, people with bunny ears, and people wrestling.

The Unicode consortium created mockups of what the emoji might look like, with the images <a href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/draft-emoji-list-for-2025-2026-revealed/">shared by <em>Emojipedia</em></a>. It is important to note th [...]<br>

You can sign up using <a href="https://forms.gle/F4kXRtBhdpSypHwG8" target="_blank">this form</a>. To be clear, the talk is not an introduction to how the planner works from a user perspective, but rather how to hack on it and try to make it better and perhaps get your improvements committed to PostgreSQL. If you're interested, please join us. I anticipate that both Melanie and I will be present for the discussions.</p><span></span><a href="https://rhaas.blogspot.com/2024/11/postgresql-hacking-workshop-december.html#more">Read more »</a><br>
