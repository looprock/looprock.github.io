Apple claims that these changes are introducing notable risks for users and developers, introducing "new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats."

Further, Apple says that the updates compromise its ability to "detect, prevent, and take action" against malicious apps, and also to support users impacted by issues with apps that are downloaded outside of the ‌App Store‌.

            With the iOS 17.4 update, Apple is making sweeping changes to iOS in order to comply with the Digital Markets Act in the European Union. Apple is opening up the browser engine, and giving users more choice over what apps and services they use as the defaults on their devices.

<br/>
Users in the EU who update to iOS 17.4 will be presented with a splash screen upon opening Safari that allows them to choose a new default browser. Apple is not providing just the standard browsers that have been options on iOS in the past, but a list of the most downloaded browsers on iOS devices. Some of the options include Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Brave, and Microsoft Edge.

Browser apps can also now use browser engines other than WebKit, both for browser apps and in-app browsing experiences within apps. At the current time, Apple requir [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Security researcher Tommy Mysk has demonstrated that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> push notifications are being used by popular apps to covertly send data about the user. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-778674" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/iPhone-12-Security-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
In a new video outlining the practice, Mysk highlighted how certain iOS apps exploit a feature introduced in iOS 10 that is designed to allow apps to customize push notifications. This feature, initially intended to enable apps to enrich notifications with additional content or decrypt encrypted messages, has seemingly been repurposed by some developers for more secretive activities. According to Mysk's findings, various popular applications, including TikTok, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Bing, are using the short background execution time granted for notification customization to send analytics information.

            Apple today promoted the durability of the iPhone 15's Ceramic Shield front glass in a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiAeKmT4QY4">"Swoop" ad</a> shared on its YouTube channel in Australia.

In the video, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_magpie#Swooping">magpie</a> attempts to attack a woman riding a bicycle, causing her to fall over. In the process, the iPhone she was using for cycling directions also drops to the ground, but it does not suffer damage due in part to the Ceramic Shield.

Apple says the Ceramic Shield is "tougher than any smartphone glass." Introduced on iPhone 12 models in 2020, Apple advertised the ceramic-infused glass as increasing drop performance by 4x compared to the iPhone 11.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a></div><br/>This article, "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/24/iphone-15-ceramic-shield-swoop-ad/">Swoop: A</a> [...]<br>
