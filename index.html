<p id="nwNIHR">Around 12AM ET last night, Twitter owner Elon Musk started tweeting — and did so for hours — about the Twitter rebrand to X, the one-letter name he’s used repeatedly in company and product names forever. It started with a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1682964919325724673">tweet</a> saying “soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds,” followed by a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1682965462886535168">second tweet</a> adding that “if a good enough X logo is posted tonight, we’ll make go live worldwide tomorrow.”</p>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-07-23 14:26:19+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            A change in Solidity’s `assert()` statement that most developers are perhaps still unaware of.

The Pixel Fold has a display size of 7.6 inches when it is unfolded, but when collapsed, the cover display measures in at 5.8 inches. Both displays feature a refresh rate up to 120Hz, like the latest Pro iPhones. It has a strong hinge that works at any angle, and when closed, there's no gap in the hinge.

Size wise, the Pixel Fold is the perfect size for day to day use when folded thanks to the cover screen, and it's sized like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> X for reference.

            Reading through the increasing number of Techdirt articles about AI, the overwhelming impression is that many people think AI is bad, and needs to be reined in before it destroys journalism/creativity/society/humanity (delete as applicable).

            Apple supplier TSMC has been working on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/01/tsmc-arizona-4nm-chips-2024/">building a chip manufacturing plant</a> in Arizona where it plans to manufacture chips for Apple, but mass production is set to be delayed because of a worker shortage.

According to <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tsmc-delays-start-of-first-arizona-chip-factory-citing-worker-shortage-4a9344e5">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>, TSMC is finding it difficult to hire people with expertise in building semiconductor factories in the United States. TSMC may have to bring in experienced technicians temporarily from Taiwan, which would delay production of the first 4nm chips until 2025.
