            Apple is preparing a fix for an issue causing some Apple Watches to experience excessive battery drain after being updated to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-releases-watchos-10-1/">watchOS 10.1</a>, the company said today in an internal memo shared with Apple Authorized Service Providers.

In the memo, which <em>MacRumors</em> obtained from multiple sources, Apple said the issue will be fixed in a watchOS update that is "coming soon." Apple did not provide any additional details in the memo, so it is unclear what the underlying cause of the issue is, how many customers are affected, and if every Apple Watch model is impacted.

With a range of three similar models in the lineup to choose from, our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these MacBook Pros is best for you. The three models are as follows:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li><strong>14-Inch MacBook Pro with M3</strong>: An entry-level model for users who need a machine that is more powerful and versatile than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>.</li>
