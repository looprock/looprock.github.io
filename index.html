            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's Vision Pro headset will be released in China as early as April and "no later than May," according to supply chain sources quoted by Asia's <em>Wall Street News</em> (via <em><a href="https://www.ithome.com/0/749/243.htm">IT Home</a></em>).

<br/>
According to the report, the registration process for the device at China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology is nearing completion, which will pave the way for the Vision Pro's launch in the country, although unit availability is initially expected to be tight.
<br/>
<br/>
Officially, Apple has said that following its recent U.S. launch on February 2, Apple Vision Pro will be coming to more countries later in the year, though the company has so far stopped short of saying which countries and when exactly.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple appears to be internally testing an iOS 17.3.1 update for the iPhone, based on evidence of the software version in our website's analytics logs this week.

<br/>
Our logs have revealed the existence of several iOS 17 versions before Apple released them, ranging from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-preparing-ios-17-0-3/">iOS 17.0.3</a> to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/apple-preparing-ios-17-2-1/">iOS 17.2.1</a>, so there is a good chance that Apple will follow through with releasing iOS 17.3.1.

<br/>
iOS 17.3.1 should be a minor update that addresses software bugs and/or security vulnerabilities. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/13/apple-releases-ios-16-3-1/">iOS 16.3.1</a> was released on February 13 last year, and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022 [...]<br>
