            <b>Published:</b> 2025-07-08 04:33:27-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple plans to launch a second-generation iPhone 17e next spring, reports Korean outlet <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=37930">The Elec</a></em>.

<br/>
According to the report, the iPhone 17e will use the same OLED panel as that found in the iPhone 16e – a panel that originally debuted in the iPhone 14 – as part of its efforts to use lower-cost components based on established production lines. 
<br/>
<br/>
Similar to the iPhone 16e, which launched in February of this year starting $599, BOE and Samsung are said to be supplying the display panels, though LG Display may also be involved. The iPhone 16e offers a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, an A18 chip, and a USB-C port, positioning it as a more affordable alternative within the iPhone 16 family.

Editors at many outlets didn&#8217;t like the way the comment section was used to prominently point out errors in stories and challenge newsrooms.

<br/>
In a statement to <em>MacRumors</em>, Apple said that the fine is unprecedented, and goes beyond what the law requires.
<br/>
<blockquote>Today we filed our appeal because we believe the European Commission's decision--and their unprecedented fine--go far beyond what the law requires. As our appeal will show, the EC is mandating how we run our store and forcing business terms which are confusing for developers and bad for users. We implemented this to avoid punitive daily fines and will share the facts with the Court.</blockquote>
