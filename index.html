            Earlier this week, Peloton said that it would drop support for Apple's GymKit feature that syncs data to the Health app. Customers were unhappy with the decision and complained to the company, leading Peloton to announce a change in plans.

<br/>
<br/>
Peloton on Thursday said that after listening to member feedback on GymKit, the integration will continue to be offered.
<br/>
<br/>
Peloton wanted to stop offering GymKit integration in favor of the Peloton One-Tap tracking feature, but GymKit has been a key feature on the $2,500 Bike+ <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/08/peloton-announces-bike-gymkit-support/">since its 2020 debut</a>, and other Peloton machines since 2022.

The premise (concocted by comedian Keaton Patti) was that you could train an artificial intelligence model on vast quantities of <em>Saw</em> films, Hallmark specials, or Olive Garden commercials and get back a bizarre funhouse-mirror version with lines like “lasagna wings with </p> [...]<br>

<p>It’s not easy to calculate the watts and joules that go into a single Balenciaga pope. But we’re not completely in the dark about the true energy cost of AI.</p> <p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="NdgX9W">It’s common knowledge that machine learning consumes a <em>lot</em> of energy. All those AI models powering email summaries, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-67012224">regicidal chatbots</a>, and videos of Homer Simpson singing nu-metal are racking up a hefty server bill measured in megawatts per hour. But no one, it seems — not even the companies behind the tech — can say exactly what the cost is. &lt;</p> [...]<br>
