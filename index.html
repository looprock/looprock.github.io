            <b>Published:</b> 2025-05-03 09:38:32-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Earlier this year, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-announces-iphone-16e/">released the iPhone 16e</a>, a more affordable iPhone 16 model that starts at $599 in the United States.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990894" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-16e-Feature-1.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
While the iPhone 16e effectively replaced the iPhone SE, it is also a first-of-its-kind device, so the release cadence for future models has yet to be established. In other words, it is unclear if Apple will release an iPhone 17e next year.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple only updated the iPhone SE once every few years, and a new report suggests that trend might continue with the "e" model.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-05-03 09:20:43-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's former design chief Jony Ive long dreamed of an iPhone with a truly all-screen design, and his wish might finally become reality in a few more years.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-793993" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/Beyond-iPhone-13-Better-Blue-Face-ID.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-iphone-release-schedule-shakeup-new-styles"><em>The Information</em> today</a> cited multiple sources who said that at least one new iPhone model launching in 2027 will have a truly edge-to-edge display. The device's front camera and Face ID system would both be placed under the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
2027 will mark the 20th anniversary of the iPhone, so the all-screen design could arrive at a significant moment in the device's history.
<br/>
<br/>
As a stepping stone towards this all-screen design, the report said that the &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-18-pro-under- [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-05-03 09:19:53-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's two-generations-away iPhone 18 Pro models will likely feature under-screen Face ID, according <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-iphone-release-schedule-shakeup-new-styles">to <em>The Information</em></a>.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1000580" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/iPhone-Top-Left-Hole-Punch-Face-ID-Feature-2.5.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
The paywalled report today cited a source who said the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max will have only a small hole in top-left corner of the screen, to accommodate the front-facing camera, with all Face ID hardware moved under the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
With under-screen Face ID, the report said the iPhone 18 Pro models would no longer have a pill-shaped cutout at the top of the screen. However, it is unclear if that means the Dynamic Island feature would be discontinued.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Starting in 2026, Apple plans to change the release cycle for its flagship <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> lineup, according to <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-iphone-release-schedule-shakeup-new-styles">The Information</a></em>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's rumored iPhone 17 Air model will have "worse" battery life compared to previous iPhone models, according to a <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-iphone-release-schedule-shakeup-new-styles">paywalled <em>The Information</em></a> report.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993585" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iPhone-17-Air-Size-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
In internal testing, Apple determined that the percentage of users who will be able to use the iPhone 17 Air for a full day without needing to recharge the device throughout the day will be between 60% and 70%, according to the report. For other iPhone models, the report said that metric is apparently between 80% and 90%.
<br/>
<br/>
The reduced battery life is due in part to the iPhone 17 Air's ultra-thin 5.5mm design, which would make it the thinnest iPhone ever.
<br/>

To mitigate this problem, the report said that Apple is planning to re [...]<br>

Apple is adding new camera features, and changing the design of the camera bump for some models. You might be skeptical of dummy models, but over the years, they've proven to be a highly accurate reflection of Apple's design changes. It's case makers who suss out the info used for these dummy models, because there's big money in being the first to market with a case for a new device.
