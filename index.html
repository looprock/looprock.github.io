            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-releases-ios-17-2-beta-4/">fourth beta of iOS 17.2</a> that Apple released today adds a much-desired feature, the option to change the default notification alert.

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924433" height="3108" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-17-default-alert.jpg" width="5526"/>
<br/>
Under Sounds &amp; Haptics, there's a new "Default Alerts" section that allows you to choose the sound used for all incoming notifications aside from texts, mail alerts, and calendar alerts, which already had customization options. 
<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not previously offered an interface for tweaking the default notification sound, so this is a notable update for those who have always wanted to select a sound. All of the text tones can be used for the default notification sound.
