<em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/">Aaron Perris</a> discovered several references to the ability to load games in the latest version of the Uber app, released on Monday.

It is unclear when Uber plans to make the mini games available to the public, and there is no guarantee that the feature will launch. No further details are known at this time, beyond the new lines of code added to the app, so we cannot confirm if the games will be available for free or require in-app purcha [...]<br>

            Folium has become the first Nintendo 3DS emulator for the iPhone <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/folium/id6498623389">available in the App Store</a>, although there are some caveats to be aware of.

<br/>
Foremost, this is the first Nintendo emulator on the App Store that costs money. Folium developer Jarrod Norwell is charging $4.99 for the app, which is a bold choice given that Nintendo recently sued the developers of Yuzu, a Nintendo Switch emulator that made a profit off a subscription-based "early access" tier. Yuzu reached a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">$2.4 million settlement</a> with Nintendo and discontinued its emulator earlier this year.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is planning a major AI overhaul in iOS 18, but some new features are unlikely to work on older iPhones, even if they do appear on the new operating system's device compatibility list.

<br/>
Apple's initial AI roadmap for iOS 18 is said to come in two parts: Basic AI features that will be processed on-device, and more advanced capabilities that will require communication with Apple's servers.
<br/>
<br/>
At the heart of these features is a redesigned Siri. To that end, Apple engineers have had to rearchitect ‌Siri‌'s underlying software using large language models (LLMs), the algorithm that underpins generative AI.

<br/>
According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/30/ai-siri-features-ios-18-2025/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, this will allow Siri to do things like open specific do [...]<br>
