Kuo did not mention pricing, but he said that the new MacBook would use an A18 Pro chip, which debuted in the iPhone 16 Pro last year.

Using an iPhone chip would be a major divergence from Apple's usual strategy of using M-series chips in its Macs, but it m [...]<br>

"Apple plans to add support in upcoming iPhones as early as next year for 5G networks that aren't tethered to Earth's surface, which includes satellites," the report said. "That would give the iPhone full internet access over satellite," it added.
<br/>

Microsoft's Copilot Fall Release introduces <a href="https://youtu.be/mOjGOLHG6AY">Mico</a> – an animated orb that serves as the voice mode's visual companion. Mico (its name a nod to Microsoft Copilot) listens, reacts, and changes colors based on the user's interactions, with the aim of giving the AI chatbot a cuter, more approachable presence.

<br/>
That said, Microsoft's attempt to soften its AI offering could backfire if users tap Mico repeatedly – the action briefly turns Mico into Clippy (officially named Clippit), the animated paperclip assistant that first appeared in Office 97 and became a fixture o [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-23 16:07:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Anthropic today said it is updating the Claude chatbot with a new memory feature, which will put Claude on par with ChatGPT. With memory enabled, Claude will be able to recall past conversations.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Anthropic first added memory to Claude earlier this year, but with the initial implementation, Claude would only recall details when specifically asked. In August, Anthropic expanded the memory feature to allow Claude to automatically remember conversation details without a specific user request, and that functionality has been limited to Team and Enterprise subscribers.
<br/>
<br/>
Claude's memory functionality is now expanding to all paid users, so Pro and Max subscribers can use the feature. Max users can turn it on now, while Pro subscribers will get access "over the coming days."
<br/>
<br/>
Memory is an opt-in feature that can be turned on in Claude's settings. There are options for "search and reference chats" and "generate memory from chat history."  [...]<br>

            Apple is one of several tech companies that will contribute to the construction of U.S. President Donald Trump's 90,000-square-foot ballroom, reports <em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/ballroom-donors-white-house-trump">CNN</a></em>.

<br/>
Construction began on the ballroom this week, and the White House's east wing was torn down. Trump claims that the ballroom will cost $350 million, and that it will be privately funded through donations. The cost has already increased $150 million over the figures that Trump previously quoted.
<br/>
<br/>
Other tech companies that have donated to the ballroom construction include Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and HP.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Earlier this month, IKEA debuted a tiny NFC-enabled bed that's meant to help smartphone users cut down on nighttime usage. The small "Phone Sleep Collection" is modeled after an actual IKEA bed, and it uses the IKEA app to monitor scroll-free sleep time.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Users who hit seven hours of scroll-free time for a week straight are eligible for an IKEA voucher.
<br/>
<blockquote>Every phone bed comes with built-in NFC tech, making sleep effortlessly rewarding. Here's how it works:
<br/>
- Download the IKEA UAE app.
<br/>
- (For iOS users) When prompted, allow Motion &amp; Fitness tracking.
<br/>
- Place your phone on its bed and tap the notification to open the app.
<br/>
- That's it. Your sleep time will track in the background (no counter will appear).
<br/>
- Complete seven nights of seven-hour sleep, and earn your voucher.</blockquote>
