<p id="Sbv6ZD">On the afternoon of March 11th, 2011, Mitsuyoshi Hirai, the chief engineer of the cable maintenance ship Ocean Link,<em> </em>was sitting in his cabin 20 miles off Japan’s eastern coast, completing the paperwork that comes at the end of every repair. Two weeks earlier, something — you rarely knew what — damaged the 13,000-mile fiber optic cable connecting Kitaibaraki, Japan, and Point Arena, California. Alarms went off; calls were made; and the next day, Hirai was sailing out of the port in Yokohama to fix it.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Last September, Apple's iPhone 15 Pro models debuted with a new customizable Action button, offering faster access to a handful of functions, as well as the ability to assign Shortcuts. Apple is poised to include the feature on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/iphone-16-action-button-all-models/">all upcoming iPhone 16 models</a>, so we asked iPhone 15 Pro users what their experience has been with the additional button so far.

<br/>
The Action button replaces the switch that activates Ring and Silent on Apple's iPhone 15 Pro models, while the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models retain the traditional Ring/Silent switch. By default, the Action button still activates these two functions via a long press, but users can also make it activate a range of other functions, including quickly opening  [...]<br>

            Apple will allegedly offer both the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max with a minimum 256GB of storage, doing away with the 128GB starting option on its smaller Pro model for the first time.

Currently, Apple's 6.1-inch iPhone 15 Pro starts at $999 and comes with the minimum 128GB of storage, while the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Pro Max starts at $1,199 with a minimum 256GB of storage.

Apple says fans will be able to "follow every matchup with added details on each series and more," but we have not noticed any immediate changes in the app after updating to the new version. The first NBA and NHL playoff series begin on Saturday, April 20, so the extra details will presumably become visible then. Some info like playoff matchups and conference standings was already available in the previous version of the app.

Released in February, the Apple Sports app shows scores, schedules, stats, and more for a variety of leagues, such as the NBA, NHL, MLB, MLS, and Premier League.  [...]<br>

            <p>When playing solo D&amp;D, try making full on characters for the major NPCs. This can be more fun because (a) making characters is fun, especially higher level ones, and, (b) you get more faceted NPCs instead of just stock, one-dimensional characters.</p>
<p>I’ve been playing through <em>Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden</em>  and I applied this one of the  duergar dwarves, Durth. In the published adventure, he’s a Duergar Mind Master. Instead of sticking wiht that, I decided to flesh him out a bit, making him a 5th level Artificer. This gave him a steel defender companion and access to interesting spells. I’ve never really played an artificer or looked at that class next, so it was fun to imagine that out. And, then, when it came to the encounter on the ferry in Easthaven, I had a lot more options than what a Mind Master would give.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Introduction Rust&rsquo;s memory safety features are advantageous to Rust developers because they:
Ensure robust protection against buffer overflows and underflows, enhancing the reliability and security of software.
Empower developers to manage type coercion effectively, promoting code reliability and safety while facilitating safe type conversions.
Provide confidence in writing concurrent code by enforcing strict mutability rules and synchronization, thereby preventing data race issues and ensuring code correctness and efficiency.
With these memory safety features deeply integrated into Rust&rsquo;s design, developers can build more reliable, secure, and efficient software, spanning various aspects of memory management, type handling, and concurrent programming paradigms.<br>

            <p>An enterprise AI strategy probably means adding AI to your existing apps and workflows, not just standing up a stand-alone AI app. We experience generative AI as chatbots in the consumer space - and they&rsquo;re great! - but this doesn&rsquo;t seem like the best approach for business applications. Think about search. We don&rsquo;t even notice it now, but at work, search is built into existing apps, it&rsquo;s not usually a stand-alone app that tightly integrates with and links into existing apps. I think Enterprise AI will be the same. We&rsquo;ll see!</p><br>
