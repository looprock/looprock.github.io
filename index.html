            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple TV has "no plans" to launch an ad-supported streaming tier for the platform, according to Apple's head of services Eddy Cue, speaking in interview with <em><a href="https://edition.pagesuite.com/html5/reader/production/default.aspx?pubname=&amp;edid=a04b0b1b-3c41-4db4-8e10-bd27650bed81">Screen International</a></em>.

<br/>
Asked if there were plans for a tier with ads, Cue said: "Nothing at this time. Again, I don't want to say no forever, but there are no plans."

<br/>
Cue added that if Apple TV can stay aggressive with its pricing, then it's better for consumers not to have their viewing experience interrupted by ads.

Apple TV cost just $4.99 per month in the U.S. when it launched in 2019, but the price has since increased three times. The price went up to $6.99 per month in 2022, and then to  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            HTX Studio this week shared the results from a six-month battery test that compared how fast charging and slow charging can affect battery life over time.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Using six <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 12 models, the channel set up a system to drain the batteries from five percent and charge them to 100 percent over and over again. Three were fast charged, and three were slow charged.
<br/>
<br/>
Another set of iPhones underwent the same test, but with charging initiated at 30 percent and stopped at 80 percent, so the iPhones were always in that range.
<br/>
<br/>
Prior to the experiment, the capacity for each phone was tested, and after 500 cycles, the capacity was tested again. The results suggest there is minimal additional battery drain from fast charging, but keeping an ‌iPhone‌ between 30 and 80 percent charge could be minimally beneficial.

In the ‌Apple TV‌ Settings app's profiles section, the "Add New Profile" option no longer requests that users sign in with an Apple device or manually with an Apple Account.

After signing up for beta testing on Apple's beta site, public beta testers can download the updates using the Software Update section in the System Settings app.

The Reminders app includes an option to have an alarm go off when a reminder is due, the News app has some design updates, and Apple is adding new features to the Podcasts app.

            Apple's online store in the U.S. is suddenly offering a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-airtag/airtag/4-pack">pack of four AirTags</a> for just $29, which is the same price as a single AirTag.

<br/>
This is likely a pricing error, and it is unclear if orders will be fulfilled. Apple has not discounted the AirTag four-pack in any other countries that we checked.

Delivery estimates are already pushing into late November to early December, suggesting that many customers are attempting to take advantage of the deal.

            All flagship models in Apple's next-generation iPhone 18 lineup will be equipped with a 24-megapixel front facing camera, up from 18 megapixels on iPhone 17 models, according to the latest JP Morgan equity research report seen by <em>MacRumors</em>.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020062" height="898" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/iphone-17-center-stage-camera-shooting.jpg" width="1600"/>

A 24-megapixel front-facing camera was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/iphone-17-24mp-front-camera-rumor/">rumored</a> for all iPhone 17 models by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/kuo-iphone-17-to-feature-24mp-front-facing-camera/">multiple sources</a>, but ultimately the rumor never came to pass.
<br/>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's first foldable iPhone will feature an industry-first 24-megapixel under-screen camera built into the inner display, according to the latest JP Morgan equity research report seen by <em>MacRumors</em>.

<br/>
We've previously heard rumors that Apple will use an under-display camera for the book-style foldable's inner display, but this is the first reference to the camera's proposed megapixel count.
<br/>
<br/>
Under-display camera technology has been used on some Android phones, but they tend to have lower resolution sensors (4 or 8 megapixels, for example) because the image quality suffers due to being behind display layers.
<br/>
<br/>
The jump to a 24-megapixel camera (with six plastic lens elements, per the report) would therefore be a significant technological advance, potentially resulting in clearer, sharper  [...]<br>

<p>The prompt I used:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use this image to determine the layout of a D&amp;D map in the style of Dungeons and Dragons adventures and maps. Pay attention to the rivers, coastline and building placement.</p>

<p>The result was cartoonish, so I prompted it again with:</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Enterprises are till trying to figure out DevSecOps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[M]any organizations remain stuck in siloed approaches that pose problems due to competing demands for speed, efficiency and risk reduction. Enterprises that effectively integrate security into software development and deployment–both through platforms and tools, and via cross-team collaboration– are better positioned to drive velocity, quality and innovation while maintaining and even improving security."</p>
<p>Also, if you must Kubernetes, try to run just one, or as few as possible: ”given the array of tools and personas involved, organizations must contend with complexity, staffing and other hurdles in addition to cost, security and integration issues. Thus, it is critical to leverage a single platform that integrates the many open-source components of an effective Kubernetes deployment and supports the different personas (e.g., cloud admins, platform engineers and security teams) involved.”</p>
