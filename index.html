<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The new iPad Air does not have too many internal changes compared to the previous-generation model. Like the fifth-generation iPad Air, the battery cells continue to have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/02/ipad-air-5-battery-pull-tabs/">adhesive pull tabs</a>, making them easier to remove.
