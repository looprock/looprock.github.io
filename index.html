            <a href="https://www.ugreen.com">Ugreen</a> today added a new 300W multi-port GaN charger to its growing stock of charging accessories.

Instead of supplying fixed power output to several devices, Ugreen's latest Nexode unit operates using variable power distribution. Its most powerful USB-C port utilizes the Power Delivery 3.1 protocol to offer up to 140W, which is enough to fast-charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro up to 50% battery in around 30 minutes using Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> 3 cable while charging four other devices at the same time.
