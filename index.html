            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has tested a redesigned version of Control Center with a customizable layout for iOS 18, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. However, we have not confirmed if this change has been finalized for the update.

<br/>
The new Control Center would feature a drag-and-drop system that allows at least some of the controls to be reorganized directly on the interface, our sources said. Currently, only the smaller controls in the bottom half of Control Center for things like the flashlight and Low Power Mode can be rearranged or removed through the Settings app. 
<br/>
<br/>
If this plan moves forward, it would represent the biggest redesign to Control Center since iOS 11 was released in 2017. On the iPhone X and newer, the menu can be opened by swiping down from the top-right corner of the  [...]<br>

On Instagram, Apple is promoting Macs to college and university students. The ad in question depicts a Back to School image with the following text: "Buy Mac for university or college with education savings. Plus get a gift card for up to $200." The screenshot of the ad is from a Canadian user, and that price point suggests we will see the same $150 discount in the United States that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/06/apple-launches-2023-back-to-school-promotion/">provided last year</a>.

<br/>
The employees suggest there are a number of risks that we are facing from AI development, including further entrenchment of existing inequalities, manipulation and misinformation, and loss of control of autonomous AI systems, which the letter says could lead to human extinction.
<br/>
<br/>
AI companies have "strong financial incentives" to forge ahead with development and to avoid sharing information about their protective measures and risk levels. "We do not think they can all be relied upon to share it voluntarily," reads the letter, which says that it is up to current and former employe [...]<br>

Folium developer Jarrod Norwell is charging $4.99 for the app, which is a bold choice given that Nintendo recently sued the developers of Yuzu, a Nintendo Switch emulator that made a profit off a subscription-based "early access" tier. Yuzu reached a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">$2.4 million settlement</a> with Nintendo and discontinued its emulator earlier this year.

            Apple is planning a major AI overhaul in iOS 18, but some new features are unlikely to work on older iPhones, even if they do appear on the new operating system's device compatibility list.

<br/>
Apple's initial AI roadmap for iOS 18 is said to come in two parts: Basic AI features that will be processed on-device, and more advanced capabilities that will require communication with Apple's servers.
<br/>
<br/>
At the heart of these features is a redesigned Siri. To that end, Apple engineers have had to rearchitect ‌Siri‌'s underlying software using large language models (LLMs), the algorithm that underpins generative AI.

<br/>
According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/30/ai-siri-features-ios-18-2025/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, this will allow Siri to do things like open specific do [...]<br>
