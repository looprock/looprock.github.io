            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-19 04:27:09-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            This year's upcoming iPhone 17 models could be the last of Apple's smartphones to include a Camera Control button because not enough iPhone owners are using it, claims a questionable new rumor out of China.

In a post Tuesday, Weibo-based account "<a href="https://weibo.com/6315816381/Q0yXQFwUa">OvO OvO OvO OvO</a>" (previously "OvO Baby Sauce OvO") claimed that Apple has informed suppliers it won't continue ordering the component, citing low engagement among users and a desire to cut costs.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a questionable claim, to say the least. The leaker behind it has no proven track record, is known mostly for aggregating other people's rumors, and has provided no source for this particular assertion. Without further evidence or corroborating reports, the suggestion that Apple is already planning to drop th [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-19 03:48:37-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's divisive new Liquid Glass design language in iOS 26 could be hinting at a major hardware redesign coming to future iPhones, reckons veteran app developer Craig Hockenberry of The Iconfactory.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1001660" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/All-Screen-iPhone-2027-Feature-1.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
In a blog post published this week titled "<a href="https://furbo.org/2025/08/17/liquid-glass-why/">Liquid Glass. Why?</a>", Hockenberry argues that unlike the transition from iOS 6 to iOS 7, which addressed a genuine need for simplified interfaces, no one outside Apple was clamoring for "more fluid glass in our designs." 
<br/>
<br/>
Recalling Apple's unveiling of Liquid Glass during WWDC, the developer reflects:
