Like many politicians (and shitty c-tier comedians turned podcasters), Ford was apparently tricked into thinking that the expensive, capacity-constrained broadband service was a sort of magic bullet for rural broadband access.

            Apple is developing a "refreshed" version of its C1 modem for mass production next year that will improve power consumption and transmission speed, as well as bring support for mmWave, according to industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990815" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/apple-c1.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
In a <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1897580253708759208">post on X (Twitter)</a>, Kuo said that while supporting the mmWave baseband isn't particularly challenging, achieving stable performance with low power consumption remains a "key hurdle" for Apple. 
<br/>
<br/>
The C1 modem that debuted in the iPhone 16e lacks support for ultra-fast mmWave 5G technology. This means users don't have access to the exceptionally fast speeds that mmWave technology can provide in specific locations such as stadiums, airports, and dense urban areas. However, Apple says the C1 is &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2 [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-05 09:04:26+01:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p><em>One bad apple ruins the bunch.</em></p>
<p>The O-Ring Theory, proposed by economist Michael Kremer in 1993, describes how small failures in complex, interdependent tasks can lead to major breakdowns. Named after the Challenger disaster, where a faulty O-ring caused the shuttle’s destruction, this model applies to production, labor markets, and economic development.</p>
<p>In an O-ring system, tasks must be performed at a consistently high level because a single weak link can compromise the entire process. This leads to high-skill clustering, where talented workers seek equally skilled colleagues, reinforcing economic inequality between firms, industries, and countries.</p>
<p>For example, in tech, a bad developer in a high-stakes project can introduce critical bugs, limiting the success of even the best engineers. This explains why top companies attract and retain top talent—because output depends on every link in the chain functioning well. It also highlights the challenge of improving productivity in</p> [...]<br>

            <p>Median Voter Theory (MVT) suggests that in a majority-rule election, the candidate closest to the median voter’s views will win. Since most voters are partisan and vote predictably, elections are decided by swing voters in the middle. To win, candidates adjust their positions to attract this decisive group, often moving toward the political center.</p>
<p>Developed by Anthony Downs in 1957, MVT explains why general election candidates tend to sound more moderate than during primaries, where they appeal to their base. Over time, this leads to policy convergence, with major parties offering similar centrist policies.</p>
<p>However, MVT assumes politics follows a single left-right spectrum, ignores low voter turnout, and struggles in polarized environments, where candidates may focus more on energizing their base than winning the middle. Despite these flaws, MVT remains a key theory in understanding why democratic elections often favor centrist policies over extreme positions.</p>
