            On Sunday, January 19, Apple will need to remove TikTok from the U.S. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, because the app will be officially banned in the United States. On the 19th, app distributors and websites will be prohibited from distributing, maintaining, or updating the TikTok app, though the app itself could continue to function on devices where it has already been downloaded. TikTok has said, however, that it plans to shut down the app when the ban begins.

<br/>
Apple's rumored smart home hub will be its second all-new product to launch in as many years, following the Apple Vision Pro headset last year. And of course, we will get several new iPhone and Apple Watch models, like every year.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The popular weather app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather-alerts-radar/id961390574">CARROT Weather</a> today was updated with two key new features: CarPlay support and automatic Live Activities.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-985705" height="891" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/CARROT-Weather-CarPlay.jpg" width="1479"/>
<br/>
When accessed via CarPlay, CARROT Weather becomes a navigation app like Google Maps. You can enter your destination and receive turn-by-turn directions, with the added benefit of being able to view the weather along your driving route. The weather features include live radar, severe weather warnings, wind speeds, visibility levels, and more. 
<br/>
<br/>
CARROT Weather's turn-by-turn directions are as snarky as its weather forecasts, so prepare for remarks such as "turn left on Rodeo Drive, meatbag," or "you went the wrong way, idiot, now I have to recalculate your entire route."
