According to Apple, users can open up Shazam, tap the blue button, and switch back to the app that was in use to see what's playing. The Shazam app engages the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s microphone to hear the song, and it is able to listen while the other app is in use. After a few seconds, the song will be identified and swapping back to Shazam will show the song name and information.

Smart contract platforms are the digital nation-state-level ecosystems that provide the security, computation, and infrastructure to support the development of applications and house the economic assets that underpin global transactional activities.</p>

Here is a reference to the Top 10 Smart contract platforms, in my personal opinion (not market capitalization).

How do you deal with uncertainty? How do you handle unexpected events? How do you react to change? Do you panic and avoid dealing with the situation or do you look at the situation with curiosity, explore alternative ways to move forward, and pivot, if need be?</p>
<p>\
The ability to think on your feet and solve problems by quickly moving between different ideas is the key to creativity at work. Mental agility makes you confidently step up and solve difficult problems when everyone else is taken aback by an unpredictable situation or an unforeseen circumstance and wondering how to deal with it. Mental agility is necessary to innovate, embrace change, and thrive in the face of uncertainty.</p>
<p>\
Building mental agility requires radically transforming your thinking for both speed and accuracy. It involves the ability for smarter reasoning by asking meaningful questions, drawing insights, and analyzing situations with better mental clarity.</p>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-07-06 15:03:08+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            "Genius design" is a term that is as tantalizing as it is elusive. It suggests that innovative designs spring from a momentary spark of divine inspiration or from the prodigious talent of a solitary individual. This narrative has been popularized by stories in the media, films, and books that celebrate moments of individual brilliance, often overshadowing the gritty reality of the design process.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Whether your iPhone or iPad is long overdue a battery replacement, or you just want to get more juice out of a single charge, here's a way to keep your device's Low Power Mode on all the time.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-858446" height="940" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/08/ios-16-battery-low-power-mode-beta-6.jpg" width="1500"/>
<br/>
Most ‌iPhone‌ and iPad users will be familiar with the way their device throws up a prompt to turn on Low Power Mode when the battery falls to 20 percent. The special mode conserves what remaining battery life the device has left by limiting some features, but by default the mode automatically turns off when a charging iPhone or iPad reaches 80 percent. If that irks you, don't worry – there is a solution.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you're running the latest version of iOS or iPadOS on an older device and you've found that the battery life is inadequate to get you through the day. Or maybe you just want to reduce the amount [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Startup valuation is a crucial factor in the early-stage venture market, driving innovation and economic growth. However, information asymmetry and the lack of accessible data often disadvantage entrepreneurs in securing fair valuations and attracting capital. Recent market fluctuations, influenced by COVID-related factors and low interest rates, have underscored the need for discipline and transparency in early-stage investments. To address these challenges, greater transparency on deal terms and market activity is essential for creating a more equitable and informed startup ecosystem.<br>

Meta describes Threads as "Instagram's text-based conversation app," and there's purpose in that precise phrasing. It doesn't just mean that your Instagram username ports over to Threads and that you have the option to follow the same people you follow on Instagram. It also means that once you create a Threads profile, there's no way to delete it unless you're prepared to delete your Instagram account wholesale.
