            Understanding web application programming interfaces (APIs) is essential in various tech roles. APIs facilitate communication between applications, and HTTP is a foundational protocol. APIs use URLs, HTTP methods (like GET and POST), query parameters, headers, response codes, and response bodies. HTTP headers carry technical details, including cookies for user sessions. Response codes indicate request outcomes, while response bodies hold data. Authorization methods include sessions and API keys. APIs often use JSON or XML for data exchange. Different API architectures, like REST (Representational State Transfer) and GraphQL, offer distinct approaches to structuring endpoints and data interaction.<br>
