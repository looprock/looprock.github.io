            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Award-winning iPhone camera app <a href="http://halide.cam/download">Halide</a> was today updated for iPhone 15 Pro models, and features a set of in-app triggers that work with the devices' new Action button.

<br/>
With the Halide 2.13 app open on an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max, the Action button can be pressed to trigger manual focus, auto/manual exposure, RAW capture, 12/48-megapixel capture, cycle through lenses, take a picture, and more.
<br/>
<br/>
To achieve the feat, Halide developers built a custom Shortcut that when selected in iOS Settings ➝ Action Button, automatically triggers a pre-set option in the app's dedicated new Action button menu when the app is active.

<p id="s1yiuN">The image generator inside the AI-powered Bing Chat is getting a big upgrade today: Microsoft announced that OpenAI’s latest DALL-E 3 model is <a href="https://blogs.bing.com/search/october-2023/DALL-E-3-now-available-in-Bing-Chat-and-Bing-com-create-for-free">now available to all Bing Chat and Bing Image Creator users</a>. It has been rolling out over the last week or so, first to Bing Enterprise users and then to Bing Image Creator, but now it’s open to everyone.</p>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-10-03 12:08:51-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, Apple replaced the traditional mute switch with a new multi-function Action Button. The button can be assigned to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-15-pro-how-to-customize-action-button/">perform a number of tasks</a>, ranging from activating the flashlight to turning on the camera. Perhaps the most useful way to use the Action Button is with Shortcuts, because the single button can perform more than one action at once or bring up a selection of tools.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>

It's unclear when iOS 17.0.3 will be released to the public, but the update will likely be available either later this week or next week.
