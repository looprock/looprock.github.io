            <b>Published:</b> 2024-10-01 04:57:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When you shoot video on iPhone 16 models, multiple formats like Spatial Audio and Stereo are recorded to allow more audio customization. If you record video with Spatial Audio turned on, you can later edit the video sound — to reduce background noise to focus on the person speaking on camera, for example.

<br/>
Spatial Audio is automatically enabled on all iPhone 16 models when you record video. Spatial Audio produces a more realistic and immersive audio recording, but it also allows you to edit the sound of your video later in the Photos app using the new Audio Mix feature.
<br/>
<br/>
Audio Mix uses machine learning to identify and separate background audio and speech, allowing you to choose one of the following options to remix your video's sound:

<ul>
<br/>
<li><strong>Standard</strong>: Play the original audio yo</li></ul> [...]<br>

            Apple's budget-friendly iPhone SE is set for a major overhaul with a fourth generation model expected to launch in spring 2025. The upcoming model will mark a significant departure from its predecessors, adopting several features from higher-end iPhones while maintaining its position as the most affordable new model in Apple's lineup.

            Verizon is currently experiencing a major outage that is affecting many customers across the U.S., including iPhone users. Affected users may be unable to send or receive phone calls, send or receive text messages, or use cellular data.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968715" height="1048" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ios-17-iphone-15-pro-status-bar-sos-crop-feature2.jpg" width="1864"/>

As a result of the network being down, many affected iPhone users are seeing "SOS" displayed in their device's status bar.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iOS 18 update brings powerful new search functions to the Photos app, allowing you to find specific images with unprecedented precision. Here's how to make the most of its new capabilities.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961382" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-Photos-Feature-Chromatic.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
In iOS 18, the key to effective searching in Photos is using natural language. Instead of simple keywords, try describing the photo you're looking for in detail. The app can now understand complex queries and find images based on specific elements within them.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you've previously identified friends and family using the People and Pets features, you can search for "Dad smiling" or "Snowy sleeping." The more specific you are, the better your results will be. You can even search for actions or emotions, like "kids laughing at swings" or "couple dancing at wedding."

            Apple is retreating from its ambitious plans for wide theatrical movie releases after several of its high-budget films failed to meet box office expectations, <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-27/apple-movies-won-t-be-coming-to-theaters-anytime-soon">Bloomberg</a></em> reports.

Apple is believed to have initially set aside $1 billion annually to produce big-budget films for cinemas, aiming to compete with traditional Hollywood studios. The company's goal was ostensibly to release a series of blockbuster movies that could drive ticket sales, win prestigious awards, and elevate its profile in the film industry.

Apple last week removed the iPhone apps for Beddit models 3.0 and 3.5 from the App Store, according to <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/">Aaron Perris</a>.

Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/05/09/apple-acquires-sleep-monitor-beddit/">acquired Beddit in 2017</a>, and it has gradually reduced hardware and software capabilities and support for the accessory since.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-09-28 07:02:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple last week released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a>, and one version of the new earbuds has Active Noise Cancellation included. ANC means the ‌AirPods 4‌ have a feature set that rivals the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2, so we thought we'd compare the two for those undecided on which to get.

<br/>
The ‌AirPods 4‌ are Apple's first open-ear earbuds to include ANC, and the major difference between the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 and the ‌AirPods 4‌ is the silicone tips. The ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 have silicone tips for a tighter seal in the ear, while the ‌AirPods 4‌ don't.

The Camera Control button has turned out to be great for quickly launching the camera and snapping photos and videos, but the more in-depth adjustments that require light presses and swiping are harder to get used to.
