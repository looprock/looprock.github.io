Apple's work on a head-mounted device was the subject of rumors for many years before the Vision Pro's announcement. By the early 2020s, those reports had converged around the idea that Apple was preparing a high-end mixed-reality headset positioned as a new form of general-purpose computer.

<p>AI is still stuck in “efficiency mode.” In many organizations, a technology organization leads AI efforts and is treated as a cost center. Those CIOs are incentivized to optimize for efficiency, not growth. The result is predictable: Tech-led AI strategies deliver productivity improvements, but not transformation. Equally concerning is that technology and AI executives tell us their business partners can’t articulate what they want from AI beyond saving money. That leadership gap bleeds over into the measurement of AI value. While most agree that AI boosts productivity, only 13% report positive EBITDA impact, and fewer than a third link AI contributions to P&amp;L. Without financial accountability, AI becomes an endless pilot treadmill — producing activity without outcomes. To shift AI from incremental savings to strategic advantage, business leaders must step in, define value in P&amp;L terms, and own the linkage between AI-driven productivity and financial performance.

According <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/the-ai-boom-is-coming-for-apples-profit-margins-4774013d">to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, Apple is exploring whether some of its lower-end processors could be manufactured by a company other than TSMC.

<br/>
"Now that TSMC is doing more business with Nvidia and other AI companies, people with knowledge of the chip supply chain said Apple was exploring whether some lower-end processors could be made by someone other than TSMC," the report said.
<br/>
<br/>
The report did not mention any candidates, but previous rumors have indicated that Intel could begin supplying some lower-end Apple processors in 2027 or 2028.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Introduction Modern advertising platforms are fast-paced and interconnected: even small adjustments can have ripple effects on how ads are shown, how budgets are spent, and the value advertisers get from their ad spend. At Yelp, Ad Budget Allocation means splitting each campaign’s spend between on‑platform inventory (our website, mobile site, and app) and off‑platform inventory (the Yelp Ad Network). We optimize this split to meet advertisers’ performance goals while growing overall revenue. Due to the complexity of the budget allocation system and its feedback loop, even small changes can lead to unexpected system‑wide effects. To help us safely evaluate changes,...<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Last year, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/apples-carplay-ultra-now-available/">launched CarPlay Ultra</a>, the long-awaited next-generation version of its CarPlay software system for vehicles. Nearly nine months later, CarPlay Ultra is still <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/first-look-at-carplay-ultra/">limited to Aston Martin's latest luxury vehicles</a>, but that should change fairly soon.

            Apple's first foldable could feature the biggest ever <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> battery and eclipse rival devices, according to a known leaker.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
In a new post, the Weibo user known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fixed-focus-digital/">Fixed Focus Digital</a>" says that the foldable's battery could be over 5,500 mAh in size, which would make it the largest capacity of any current or previous ‌iPhone‌.

            Apple is "exploring" the idea of a foldable iPhone with a "square, clamshell-style" design, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-01/apple-s-record-quarter-and-ai-changes-macbook-pro-update-clamshell-iphone-fold">according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

<br/>
A so-called "iPhone Flip" — unlikely to be the real name — would compete with devices such as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/samsung-galaxy-z-fold7/">Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> and the <a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/en/family/razr2025">modern-day Motorola Razr</a>.

macOS 26.3 remains in beta testing, but the update should be coming soon, with a wide release expected in February. Gurman was careful to also mention March, but this seems rather unlikely, unless the macOS 26.3 bet [...]<br>

            Apple recently <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/">updated its online store</a> with a new ordering process for Macs, including the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, Mac mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro.

There used to be a handful of standard configurations available for each Mac, but now you must configure a Mac entirely from scratch on a feature-by-feature basis. In other words, ordering a new Mac now works much like ordering an iPad.
