            <b>Published:</b> 2025-05-15 04:22:25-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has begun placing prominent warning labels on EU App Store listings that use alternative payment methods. The warning symbols appear as a red exclamation mark in a triangle, accompanied by text stating that the app "does not support the App Store's private and secure payment system" and "uses external purchases."
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="App Store" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1001684" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/app-store-external-payments-warning.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
As noted by <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2025/05/14/critical-warning-for-external-purchases-in-app-store/">Michael Tsai</a>, Apple is using its highest-level "critical" alert iconography – the same triangle symbol that macOS reserves for situations that might result in "unexpected loss of data."
<br/>
<br/>
Instacar, a popular Hungarian car valuation app with thousands of positive reviews, appears to be among the first to receive this treatment.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's upcoming foldable iPhone will have a hole-punch camera on the outer display, claims a Chinese leaker in Apple's supply chain.

<br/>
According to the Weibo-based account <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PrVl5kiGX">Digital Chat Station</a>, the inner display on the book-style foldable is a 14.1:1 panel featuring an under-screen camera, while the outer screen is a 14.6:1 panel with a hole-punch camera.
<br/>
<br/>
The leaker claims that these specifications relate to a new engineering prototype from Apple that's "slightly smaller than the previous unit we handled, with the same resolution and aspect ratio," according to a machine translation. The leaker added that a Touch ID sensor is included on the side of the device.

"I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday," Trump said during his state visit to Qatar, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/trump-wants-apple-to-stop-moving-iphone-production-to-india">Bloomberg</a></em>. "He is building all over India."

            Two years after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/12/warner-bros-launching-max-streaming-service/">changing the name</a> of HBO Max to just Max, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) is reversing its decision. Starting this summer, Max is <a href="https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/max/warner-bros-discovery-announces-max-become-hbo-max-summer">going to be rebranded</a> as HBO Max.

<br/>
It turns out that it may have been a bad idea dropping the well-recognized HBO brand name from the Max streaming service and opting for a much more generic name. In a blog post explaining the decision, WBD says that the HBO brand is best known for its consistent, high-quality content, which is what the company wants to focus on.

<li><strong>The new iOS design</strong>. We've been hearing that Apple is planning a major design overhaul for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a>, with a look that's inspired by visionOS. Round buttons, glassier interface elements, and a simplified design style are expected. It's going to be the biggest design change since iOS 7, which was controversial when it launched. We're sure to see some of the same love it or hate it type of reactions with the 2025 revamp.</li>

            Apple is believed to be developing several technological innovations to mark the 20th anniversary of the iPhone, and one key technology it's considering is Mobile High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), according to a report from <em><a href="https://www.etnews.com/20250514000084">ETNews</a></em>.

<br/>
HBM is a type of DRAM that stacks memory chips vertically  and connects them via tiny vertical interconnects called Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs) to dramatically boost signal transmission speeds. It's primarily used in AI servers today, and is often referred to as AI memory due to its ability to support AI processing alongside GPUs. 
<br/>

Mobile HBM is what the term suggests – a variant of the technology for mobile devices that is designed to deliver very high data throughput while minimizing power consumption  [...]<br>

<em><a href="https://www.etnews.com/20250514000320">ETNews</a></em> writes that Apple is aiming to use "four-edge bending" display technology for the 2027 iPhone that would curve not just along the left and right sides as seen in some current smartphones, but also wrap around the top and bottom edges. This would create a truly borderless visual experience with content flowing seamlessly across all sides of the device.
