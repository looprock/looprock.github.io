            On all models in Apple's new iPhone 17 series as well as the iPhone Air, the new 18MP Center Stage front camera transforms mobile photography with its square sensor design and intelligent auto-adjustment features.

            Repair site <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/">iFixit</a> today did one of its traditional teardowns <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/113171/iphone-air-teardown">on the iPhone Air</a>, which is Apple's thinnest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to date and the first major redesign we've seen in the ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå line in several years.

<br/>
To fit all of the necessary components in a 5.6mm frame, Apple designed a camera "plateau." The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a>'s logic board is partially inside of the camera bump, providing space for a large, metal-encased battery. The position of the logic board also ensures that it's protected from bending stress if the ‚ÄåiPhone Air‚Äå happens to flex, though we've seen in several tests that the titanium frame of the device <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/17/iphone-air-bend-test/">is almost bend-proof</a>.

<br/>
Instead of the familiar split between standard and Pro models, Apple this year introduced the new ‚ÄåiPhone Air‚Äå and expanded the feature gap between tiers. The result is a predicament between the affordable and practical ‚ÄåiPhone 17‚Äå, and the super-thin and all-new ‚ÄåiPhone Air‚Äå, with distinct trade-offs in size, materials, camera hardware, and battery life along the way. While they both share brighter displays, ProMotion, and an all-new 18-megapixel camera, their designs, display sizes, and camera features are more specialized than ever before.
