            Two years after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/12/warner-bros-launching-max-streaming-service/">changing the name</a> of HBO Max to just Max, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) is reversing its decision. Starting this summer, Max is <a href="https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/max/warner-bros-discovery-announces-max-become-hbo-max-summer">going to be rebranded</a> as HBO Max.

It turns out that it may have been a bad idea dropping the well-recognized HBO brand name from the Max streaming service and opting for a much more generic name. In a blog post explaining the decision, WBD says that the HBO brand is best known for its consistent, high-quality content, which is what the company wants to focus on.

The second- and third-generation Apple TV 4K supports two additional connection standards, called ARC and eARC.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is believed to be developing several technological innovations to mark the 20th anniversary of the iPhone, and one key technology it's considering is Mobile High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), according to a report from <em><a href="https://www.etnews.com/20250514000084">ETNews</a></em>.

<br/>
HBM is a type of DRAM that stacks memory chips vertically  and connects them via tiny vertical interconnects called Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs) to dramatically boost signal transmission speeds. It's primarily used in AI servers today, and is often referred to as AI memory due to its ability to support AI processing alongside GPUs. 
<br/>
<br/>
Mobile HBM is what the term suggests – a variant of the technology for mobile devices that is designed to deliver very high data throughput while minimizing power consumption  [...]<br>

<em><a href="https://www.etnews.com/20250514000320">ETNews</a></em> writes that Apple is aiming to use "four-edge bending" display technology for the 2027 iPhone that would curve not just along the left and right sides as seen in some current smartphones, but also wrap around the top and bottom edges. This would create a truly borderless visual experience with content flowing seamlessly across all sides of the device.
