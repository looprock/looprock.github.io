            <b>Published:</b> 2024-10-02 16:04:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Now that Apple doesn't include power adapters with new iPhones, you have to supply your own, and it can be a little confusing figuring out what you need specifically to get the fastest charging speeds. Apple added another layer of complexity this year with upgraded <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> charging for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models, a feature that also requires specific hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964753" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-pro-colors-1.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
<h2 id="usb-c">USB-C</h2>
<br/>
All of the ‌iPhone 16‌ models can charge from 0 to 50 percent in approximately 30 minutes. You need Apple's $19 20W adapter or better for fast charging, and if you already had an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> that could fast charge, you probably have the hardware you need.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            For the first time in the standard AirPods range, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a> offer optional active noise cancellation (ANC) for an additional $50, providing a quieter and more immersive listening experience, especially in noisy environments.
<br/>

<br/>
Key upgrades of the ‌AirPods 4‌ include a more comfortable fit, improved sound quality with a new low-distortion driver, and enhanced features like Personalized Spatial Audio. Beyond active noise cancellation, there are a handful of additional features that differentiate the two ‌AirPods 4‌ models. This buyer's guide breaks down all of the differences between the two variants and helps you to decide which best fits your needs.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-10-02 08:33:47-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Best Buy might offer an unspecified iPad mini model on clearance "soon," according to a <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-computer-inc-9555093/9555093.p?skuId=9555093">product listing</a> that was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1fuh98z/ipad_mini_clearance_coming_soon/">spotted</a> on the retailer's website.

<br/>
The placeholder listing is for an Apple product with a "MINI WIFI" model name, and it is in the "tablets" section on Best Buy's online store. Altogether, this strongly suggests that the listing will be for an iPad mini. The device will apparently be available for a clearance price of $359.99 in the U.S., down from a regular price of $599. However, the iPad mini currently starts at $499, so the listing appears to have a pricing error.

            Well-known electronics repair website iFixit today shared an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sF0BOpbyjY">AirPods 4 teardown video</a> that offers a look inside Apple's latest wireless earbuds. Specifically, these are the entry-level <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4-vs-previous-generations/">AirPods 4</a> without active noise cancellation (ANC).
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Unsurprisingly, iFixit said AirPods remain a "nightmare to take apart," with the earbuds earning a lowest-possible 0/10 score on iFixit's reparability scale.
<br/>
<br/>
The teardown does not reveal any major internal differences between the AirPods 3 and AirPods 4.

<br/>
The charging case for the AirPods 4 without ANC is equipped with a 345 mAh battery. This is the same size battery as in the AirPods 3 charging case.

Users are supposed to only be able to clap between 0 and 50 times for a given post, but this hack allowed them to go outside those bounds (both above and below). Our fix leverages <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.ConditionExpressions.html">DynamoDB condition expressions</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadConsistency.html">strongly consistent reads</a> to block updates on data that have been manipulated after a read, but before a write.
