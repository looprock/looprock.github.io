<p>Five years ago, the idea of running data workloads on Kubernetes still raised eyebrows. Today, it’s the norm — and the question has changed from <em>“Can we?”</em> to <em>“How do we do it best?”</em></p>
<p>The <strong>2025 Data on Kubernetes Report</strong>, based on a survey of 182 technology professionals, marks a major inflection point for our community. The results show that DoK has officially crossed the chasm: adoption is complete, and the next chapter is all about <strong>optimization, cost management, and AI-driven innovation.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>From Adoption to Optimization</strong></h3>
<p>Nearly half of organizations now run <strong>50% or more</strong> of their data workloads on Kubernetes in production. A</p> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is going to release a low-cost MacBook in 2026, with the device set to be more affordable than the $999 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>. With the affordable notebook, Apple is aiming to better compete with cheap Chromebooks and Windows PCs.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            HTX Studio this week shared the results from a six-month battery test that compared how fast charging and slow charging can affect battery life over time.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Using six <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 12 models, the channel set up a system to drain the batteries from five percent and charge them to 100 percent over and over again. Three were fast charged, and three were slow charged.
<br/>
<br/>
Another set of iPhones underwent the same test, but with charging initiated at 30 percent and stopped at 80 percent, so the iPhones were always in that range.
<br/>
<br/>
Prior to the experiment, the capacity for each phone was tested, and after 500 cycles, the capacity was tested again. The results suggest there is minimal additional battery drain from fast charging, but keeping an ‌iPhone‌ between 30 and 80 percent charge could be minimally beneficial.
<br/>

HTX Studio concluded that the best way to charge an ‌iPhone‌ is "however you  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With tvOS 26.2, Apple is changing the way that profiles work on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. It's now possible to create a profile without an Apple Account, which is particularly useful for guest profiles and profiles for children.

<br/>
In the ‌Apple TV‌ Settings app's profiles section, the "Add New Profile" option no longer requests that users sign in with an Apple device or manually with an Apple Account.
<br/>
<br/>
Alongside the Apple Account sign in, there is a "Create Profile" option that only requires a name, a profile rating, and a yes or no question about whether the new user is a child.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today provided public beta testers with the first release of an upcoming macOS Tahoe 26.2 update for testing purposes. The public beta comes a day after Apple provided the beta to developers.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006759" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/macOS-Tahoe-26-Thumb-2.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
After signing up for beta testing on Apple's beta site, public beta testers can download the updates using the Software Update section in the System Settings app.
<br/>
<br/>
The Reminders app includes an option to have an alarm go off when a reminder is due, the News app has some design updates, and Apple is adding new features to the Podcasts app.
<br/>
<br/>
The beta is limited to developers and public beta testers right now, but it won't be a long testing period. We'll likely see Apple release macOS Tahoe 26.2 right around mid-December given past launch timelines.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: </div> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>With a little prompt craft, you can get some good regional maps out of ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Here is the original photo I took on a flight from London for Amsterdam:</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/3446/2025/1792971f-a46a-4e18-9420-b1526257f95f.jpg"><img alt="" height="3213" src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/3446/2025/1792971f-a46a-4e18-9420-b1526257f95f.jpg" width="5712"/></a></p>
<p>The prompt I used:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use this image to determine the layout of a D&amp;D map in the style of Dungeons and Dragons adventures and maps. Pay attention to the rivers, coastline and building placement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The result was cartoonish, so I prompted it again with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wanted it more from the perspective of the original and more realistic looking don’t put names in things</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Enterprises are till trying to figure out DevSecOps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[M]any organizations remain stuck in siloed approaches that pose problems due to competing demands for speed, efficiency and risk reduction. Enterprises that effectively integrate security into software development and deployment–both through platforms and tools, and via cross-team collaboration– are better positioned to drive velocity, quality and innovation while maintaining and even improving security."</p>
<p>Also, if you must Kubernetes, try to run just one, or as few as possible: ”given the array of tools and personas involved, organizations must contend with complexity, staffing and other hurdles in addition to cost, security and integration issues. Thus, it is critical to leverage a single platform that integrates the many open-source components of an effective Kubernetes deployment and supports the different personas (e.g., cloud admins, platform engineers and security teams) involved.”</p>
