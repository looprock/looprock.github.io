            Some users of iPhones running iOS 18 are reporting intermittent touchscreen responsiveness issues, with some devices seemingly ignoring taps and swipes.

            Former Apple chief design officer Jony Ive has officially confirmed his involvement in an artificial intelligence hardware project with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. The confirmation appeared in a profile of the designer by <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/technology/jony-ive-apple-lovefrom.html">The New York Times</a></em>, putting to rest speculation that began nearly a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/jony-ive-openai-design-ai-hardware/">year ago</a> about a potential collaboration between the two figures.

            In 2025, Apple is expected to discontinue the iPhone "Plus" device in its iPhone 17 lineup to make way for an iPhone "Air" – although it may not actually be called this when the device debuts in the fall of next year. Even though the iPhone 16 series has only just launched, when you consider that we learned about larger displays on the iPhone 16 Pro models way back in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/">May 2023</a>, rumors about a next-generation iPhone aren't all that unusual so far ahead of time.

Ross Young of Display Supply Chain Consultants today informed <em>MacRumors</em> that the standard iPhone 17 and a slimmer model that we are calling the "iPhone 17 Air" will both feature ProMotion, meaning that each device's display would be able to ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video content when necessary.

ProMotion would also allow the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air displays to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate. iPhone 13 Pro models can ramp down to 10Hz, while iPhone 14 Pro through iPhone 16 Pro models can go as low as 1Hz, allowing for an always-on display that shows various Lock Screen elements eve [...]<br>
