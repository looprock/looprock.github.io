            <b>Published:</b> 2023-12-15 10:05:40-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has agreed to <a href="http://petersfamilysharingplan.com">settle a class action lawsuit</a> over Family Sharing, and will pay out $25 million to put an end to the case. First filed in 2019, the lawsuit accused Apple of misrepresenting the way that subscriptions to third-party apps worked with the Family Sharing feature.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926839" height="1232" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/apple-family-sharing.jpg" width="2190"/>
<br/>
While Family Sharing allows participants to share subscriptions with one another, app developers can opt out of allowing a single subscription to be shared among multiple people. Not all subscriptions can be shared because of the opt out policy, which is what led to the lawsuit.
<br/>
<br/>
Though Apple has agreed to a settlement, the company says it did nothing wrong and denies making misleading misrepresentations. Apple decided to avoid the potential cost and burden of a jury trial.

In a research note this week with Hong Kong-based investment firm Haitong International Securities, focused on Apple supplier Largan Precision, Pu said the iPhone 17 Pro Max's upgraded 48-megapixel Telephoto lens will be optimized for use with Apple's upcoming Vision Pro headset, set to be released in the U.S. in early 2024. Pu did not provide any additional details about the lens, or how it will interface with the Vision Pro.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iPhone 17 Pro models in 2025 will be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip, according to Jeff Pu, an analyst who covers companies within Apple's supply chain.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-883034" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/Apple-Wi-Fi-Chip-Feature-Triad.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
In a research note this week with Hong Kong-based investment firm Haitong International Securities, Pu said the chip could be a long-term threat to Broadcom, which currently supplies Apple with a combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip for iPhones.
<br/>
<br/>
Pu believes Apple will expand its in-house Wi-Fi chip to the entire iPhone 18 series in 2026. He did not share any additional details about the chip.

In January, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman reported that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/09/apple-in-house-modem-chips-2024/">developing its own combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip</a> for use in devices starting i [...]<br>

<br/>
The current Apple Watch Ultra has a display size of 1.93-inches, whereas the upcoming microLED model is apparently due to feature a 2.12-inch screen. The microLED panel is estimated to cost two to three times more than the equivalent OLED display used in the current model, at a price of around $120. It is due to be supplied by Germany's ams OSRAM and South Korea's LG Display.

<br/>
If you are a long-time Apple Watch user, you probably remember a time when it was possible to switch watch faces with a simple swipe gesture across the display. That was the default interaction in watchOS 9, but then Apple removed the gesture with the upgrade to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple changed the interaction because of user complaints that it was too easy to accidentally change watch faces. But for anyone who never had this problem, Apple just made things harder – by requiring a long press before swiping to change the active watch face.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <a href="https://auraframes.com">Aura</a>, a company known for its range of smart photo frames, this fall <a href="https://auraframes.com/digital-frames/color/walden-ink-mat">introduced the Walden</a>, its largest photo frame to date. Measuring in at 15 inches, the Walden has a huge display that makes digital photos a focal point in the home.

<br/>
We've previously reviewed (and liked) the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/aura-mason-digital-frame/">9-inch Aura Mason frame</a>, but the new Walden model is 66 percent larger and it is also Aura's first frame that can be mounted on the wall, so we thought we'd revisit the smart frames ahead of the holidays.
<br/>
<br/>
In terms of size, the Walden frame is 15.7 inches long, 12.7 inches tall, and 1.2 inches in depth, so it's a little bit thicker than your average photo frame.  [...]<br>

I was able to test out the $200 Hue Secure Wired Camera to see how it measures up to some of the other smart camera options on the market. Hue's cameras can be used indoors or out, and the Hue Secure has 1080p video recording with night vision and motion trigger alerts, which at this point I'd expect from any security camera.
