            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple last week began shipping out the new USB-C <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>, so we thought we'd check it out for <em>MacRumors</em> readers who might be interested in purchasing one. The USB-C ‌Apple Pencil‌ is compatible with all iPads that have a USB-C port and that are running iOS 17.1 or later.

<br/>
When it comes to design and feel, the USB-C ‌Apple Pencil‌ is much like the second-generation ‌Apple Pencil‌, featuring a matte finish and a flat side where it can attach to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, but it's worth noting that it's shorter. Unlike the ‌Apple Pencil‌ 2, it is not able to pair with an ‌iPad‌ automatically, and you'll need a USB-C cable for pairing purposes.

            Apple is developing custom batteries with significantly improved performance that it aims to bring to its devices starting in 2025, <a href="https://m.etnews.com/20231106000233"><em>ETNews</em></a> reports.

<br/>
Apple's custom battery technology has reportedly been in the works since 2018, with the company actively seeking patents and hiring new personnel related to the project. The company is reportedly seeking to create an "all-new" kind of battery with significantly improved performance by becoming directly involved in its use of materials.

In the memo, which <em>MacRumors</em> obtained from multiple sources, Apple said the issue will be fixed in a watchOS update that is "coming soon."

The claim came as part of a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/competition/digital_markets_act/cases/202344/DMA_100027_197.pdf">response</a> to the European Union in August, just before the European Commission designated many of Apple's iOS, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, and Safari as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/app-store-safari-and-ios-designated-gatekeepers/">gatekeeper platforms</a>.

            This is not a fun case. It&#8217;s instructional, but it involves some pretty noxious criminal behavior. And that&#8217;s how these things work, usually.

            After being discussed for years and years, the Online Safety Act in the UK is now law, after receiving “royal assent” last week. Hilariously, the UK&#8217;s announcement declared that children and adults will now be safer online, as if that&#8217;s absolutely true. It&#8217;s not, though.
