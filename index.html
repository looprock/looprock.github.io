            <b>Published:</b> 2023-07-02 19:00:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iPhone users in Australia can now receive next-hour precipitation forecasts and notifications from the Weather app, according to an updated <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211777">Apple support document</a>.

<br/>
"Next-hour precipitation forecasts and precipitation notifications are available for Australia, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States," the document says. "The information is provided by Apple using data from national weather services."
<br/>
<br/>
Apple says next-hour precipitation forecasts are "hyperlocal" and "down to the minute." The Weather app can send iPhone users a push notification if it is going to rain in the next hour, and shows how much rainfall is expected by the minute. The feature has been available in the U.S. since the release of iOS 14 in 2020.

The question I’ve had in my mind for the last 6 months was what do I spend my time on that’s bullshit? As Paul Graham notes in his[essay], there’re circumstantial and chosen bullshit. The former is what we need to deal with to live like making money, commuting to work, doing taxes. The chosen bullshit is engaging in arguments online, social media, spending time with toxic people etc.<br>

<br/>
Starting a video in Twitter and then swiping out of the app leaves the video player open, so Twitter users can use other apps while continuing to watch video content from the social network. 
<br/>
<br/>
Twitter has had an in-app picture-in-picture option previously, but the new feature allows Twitter video to be watched while using other apps, similar to how YouTube and other video content apps work on iPhones and iPads.
