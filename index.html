<br/>
The Macs will ship with a custom version of ‌macOS Sonoma‌ 14.1 with a build number of 23B2073, but new users will need to download and install a new version with a build number of 23B2077.
<br/>
<br/>
Day one updates are not unusual for new devices as Apple often has to begin manufacturing with an older version of the software. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-releases-macos-sonoma-14-1/">first released macOS Sonoma 14.1</a> on Wednesday, October 25, and the current version has a build number of 23B74.

            <p>While Postgres excels at supporting many workloads, including modern ones, there are still some workloads it cannot handle.  Two areas that Postgres is currently unable to handle involve large data
volumes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Data sets which are so large that they cannot be efficiently processed by a single server
  </li><li>Write-heavy workloads that cannot be efficiently written by a single server
</li></ul>
<p>Postgres is a great general-purpose database, and it might be fine if Postgres were deemed unacceptable for such workloads, especially if supporting such workloads required a major redesign of Postgres. 
However, could Postgres be modified incrementally to support such workloads?  This is what the Postgres development community has been working on since

Only a limited number of developers have access to Vision Pro at this time, with the headsets used for app testing purposes.

Apple has said that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> will be coming to ‌visionOS‌ soon, and it appears that it may be present in this fifth beta.
