According to YouTube, the video results carousel will use AI to highlight clips from videos that "will be most helpful for your search query," which essentially means that it will take clips from videos and play them right in results, so people may not need to click into a video to find the information they're looking for.

Google uses AI overviews for Google Search, but the YouTube version will differ. AI won't summarize videos, and will simply pull clips from them. It is not clear the AI-selected clips will encourage users to watch a full video, or cause fewer peo [...]<br>

            Meta <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/04/new-features-threads-web-experience/">today announced</a> that it is adding several new web features to the Threads social network, as well as officially relocating the website to a new domain. Threads is migrating from Threads.net to Threads.com, and Threads.com will be the new default domain name.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-999712" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/threads-web-improvements.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
When Threads launched in 2023, Meta did not own Threads.com, so it was located at Threads.net. Meta acquired Threads.com in September 2024, and since then, the Threads.com domain forwarded to Threads.net. Going forward, users who type Threads.net into a browser window will be forwarded to Threads.com.
<br/>
<br/>
To accompany the name change, Threads on the web is getting several interface updates to make browsing through posts on the social network easier.

            Netflix <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/introducing-a-new-way-to-experience-subtitles">today announced</a> that it is introducing a new subtitle option that only shows subtitles for spoken dialogue, aimed at those who don't need captions, but prefer to watch movies and TV shows with the subtitles turned on.

<br/>
According to Netflix, nearly half of all viewing hours on the streaming service in the U.S. happen with the subtitles or captions on, which is why it is debuting the new setting.

The new option will show subtitles for dialogue, but no audio cues such as [phone buzzing], [door slams], or [fireplace crackling], which are normally shown when closed captioning is turned on.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the launch of iOS 18.4, Apple introduced a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> feature that summarizes multiple user reviews to provide an at-a-glance summary of what people think of an app or a game.

Apple is using a multi-step large language model (LLM) system to generate the summaries, with the aim of creating overviews that are inclusive, balanced, and accurately reflect the user's voice.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdR32VJQ6aE">shared a new ad</a> that highlights a key advantage that iPhone 16 models have over Android smartphones: the Ceramic Shield.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Apple says the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max displays are all protected by the latest-generation Ceramic Shield material, which is advertised as being "2x tougher than glass on any other smartphone."
<br/>
<br/>
In the new "Trust Issues" ad, a father hands his iPhone to a stranger and asks them to take a photo of his family at a carnival. Unfortunately, the stranger drops the iPhone, leading to a moment of suspense given the device might have been damaged. However, the display glass remains intact due to the Ceramic Shield.
<br/>
<br/>
"Relax, it's iPhone 16," the video description concludes.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, your mileage may vary.

            While the so-called "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>" is not expected to launch until September, there are already plenty of rumors about the ultra-thin device.

<br/>
Overall, the iPhone 17 Air sounds like a mixed bag. While the device is expected to have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/22/iphone-17-air-thinness-video/">impressively thin and light design</a>, rumors indicate it will have some compromises compared to iPhone 17 Pro models, including only a single rear camera, a single speaker, and an A19 chip instead of a more powerful A19 Pro chip.
<br/>
<br/>
While there have been some concerns that the iPhone 17 Air's thin design could result in limited battery life, the device might end up &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/iphone-17-air-price-bat [...]<br>

<br/>
In a <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/luXVWtplQ9Bokb">blog post</a> today, the well-known Apple supply chain analyst said that the iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will all be equipped with 12GB of RAM. He previously only expected the iPhone 17 Pro Max to have 12GB of RAM, so this is good news for customers who will be purchasing the other models.
<br/>
<br/>
Kuo said even the base-model iPhone 17 might be equipped with 12GB of RAM, but only if supply chain shortages can be overcome. He said that Apple will make a final decision on the amount of RAM it will offer in this device by May.

<br/>
The cutting-edge A14 node will allow for highly advanced 1.4nm chips that are likely to be utilized for future generations of Apple silicon. Compared to TSMC's N2 node, A14 promises up to 15% faster performance at the same power or up to 30% power savings at the same performance. A14 also boasts over 20% logic density improvement.
<br/>
<br/>
TSMC said it is also evolving its TSMC NanoFlex standard cell architecture to NanoFlex Pro, enabling greater performance, power efficiency, and design flexibility.

Just <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/illuminatedcodex/search/battlemaps">looking at them is fun, finding them can be a tiny thrill, and making them is a delightful way to spend hours of time</a>. Oh, and using them. I’ve used Midjourney to make D&amp;D battle maps in the past, <a href="https://cote.io/2024/04/03/creating-huge-dd.html">especially to make really large battle maps</a>. That works great! ChatGPT was never that good at it, until now.</p>

            <p>Playing D&amp;D with ChatGPT, Claude, or whatever is fun. But sometime you want more control over how it behaves and what it does. Check out this video for a quick tutorial on creating an oracle plugin for Claude. This &ldquo;plugin&rdquo; is a Model Context Protocol Server written in Java using Spring AI. Once you create the MCP Server, you can hook the oracle into Claude which will use it while you play as a simple yes/no oracle. This is a simple example that will show you how to get everything setup with Java and Spring AI to start making MCP Server tools.
