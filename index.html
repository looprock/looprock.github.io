Federighi admitted that the first-generation architecture that Apple was developing for the personalized Siri features was too limited, which prevented the features from reaching the company's high quality standards.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-10 13:50:24-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iPadOS 26, Apple is introducing major changes to the way that multitasking works, and part of that update will see the removal of Split View and Slide Over, two multitasking interface options that have long existed on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. 
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
iPadOS 26 allows for multiple app windows, each of which can be resized freely on the display. The feature works on all ‌iPad‌ models able to run iPadOS 26, though there are limitations on how many apps can be open at once. On older iPads, for example, you're limited to four apps. Newer iPads can have more open app windows.
<br/>
<br/>
You can change the size of ‌iPad‌ app windows, move them on top of each other, and rearrange them as desired, much like on the Mac. There are also tiling options so that you can see t [...]<br>

<br/>
Apple tends to quietly remove some watch face options when it launches a new version of iOS, so it is not a huge surprise to see these go missing. It is not clear why Apple picked these watch faces in particular, but it could be because they were used less often.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple didn't add new watch faces with watchOS 26, but some watch faces have new Liquid Glass-inspired design options.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com</div> [...]<br>

            Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Apple offered a line of Wi-Fi routers that it referred to as AirPort base stations.

Traditionally, when Apple announced a major new operating system update, the first wave of betas would only be available to download by paying subscribers to <a href="https://developer.apple.com">Apple's Developer Program</a>, which costs $99 a year. Public betas would then become available to users enrolled in <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/welcome">Apple's Public Beta Software Program</a> after a delay of a few days or weeks after the developer beta has been released. That all changed in 2023, and these days iPhone users no longer have to wait for a publicly released beta to test what's new.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            This weekend, Donald Trump pulled off something that&#8217;s happened exactly once before in US history: federalizing a state&#8217;s National Guard over the state governor&#8217;s objections without invoking the Insurrection Act. And he did it to deal with what the LAPD itself described as peaceful protests that were &#8220;under control.&#8221; The constitutional implications here are important. [&#8230;]<br>

With the Notes app on the Apple Watch, you can finally view your notes right on your wrist. You can also create new notes with Siri, or by using the on-screen keyboard, and they will sync to your iPhone, iPad, and Mac via iCloud.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-10 04:43:32-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26 beta 1, Apple has seemingly tweaked the swipe-to-go-back gesture to make it easier to navigate screens on bigger iPhones.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005254" height="3078" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/swipe-to-go-back-gesture-ios-26.jpg" width="5472"/>
<br/>
In iOS 18, many apps allow you to navigate back to the previous screen by swiping with your thumb from the left edge of the display. This is generally easier than tapping a back button in the top-left corner, especially if you're navigating with one hand. 
<br/>
<br/>
However, to trigger the gesture, you need to start swiping from the very edge of the screen, which is harder if you have small hands or you're using a larger device like an iPhone 16 Pro Max.
<br/>
<br/>
To make things easier in iOS 26, you no longer have to start the rightward swipe at the very edge of the screen. Now you can start the gesture from anywhere, like the middle of the display. Providing you're not  [...]<br>

            This article was originally published in 2018, yet its core insights into Go’s garbage collection model remain highly relevant for developers today. While some implementation details of Go’s runtime have evolved, the foundational concepts explored here—such as the semantics of the tri-color mark and sweep algorithm, Stop The World (STW) events, and GC trace interpretation—are still essential to understanding how Go manages memory. Whether you&rsquo;re optimizing performance or deepening your knowledge of Go internals, this post continues to offer a clear and practical guide to working with the garbage collector, not against it.<br>
