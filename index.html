            Apple is fighting to defend its multi-billion dollar search engine deal with Google as Google is prosecuted for antitrust violations, and so far, the court isn't making it easy. Last week, Apple filed a motion for an emergency stay that would give the Cupertino company time to intervene in the lawsuit, but the judge overseeing the case denied Apple's motion [<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1160.0.pdf">PDF</a>] and won't hold off on moving forward.

In November, Apple asked the court to allow it to be more involved in the case as the court decides what steps to take to prevent Google from continuing to violate antitrust law.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-02 08:34:59-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Starting next week, Apple's retail stores will no longer offer AppleCare+ plans as a one-time purchase, according <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1886083012967948722">to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, Gurman said AppleCare+ will remain available as a one-time purchase on Apple's online store, at least for now.
<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear if this policy change is limited to the U.S. or will apply worldwide.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple likely profits more by offering AppleCare+ as a monthly or annual subscription, which helps to boos [...]<br>
