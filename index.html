            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Well-known Apple accessory maker Satechi today previewed a <a href="https://satechi.net/landing/new-stand-and-hub-m4-mac-mini">hub for the new Mac mini</a> that will enhance the computer in a variety of ways.

<br/>
First, the hub adds three USB-A ports to the Mac mini, after Apple went all-in on USB-C and Thunderbolt ports on the latest models.
<br/>
<br/>
Second, the hub gives the Mac mini an SD card slot, which is something it otherwise lacks. Just like on the Mac Studio, it is a front-facing slot.
<br/>
<br/>
Third, the hub includes an NVMe enclosure that allows you to add an SSD with up to 4TB of storage to the Mac mini. This can both expand the Mac mini's storage and allow you to avoid Apple's expensive storage upgrade prices.
<br/>
<br/>
The hub is made out of aluminum and looks similar to the Mac mini. Satechi ens [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-11-21 06:41:26-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In March, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and 16 states <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/21/apple-sued-by-us-department-of-justice/">filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple</a>, alleging that the company has an illegal monopoly in the smartphone market with the iPhone and the device's locked-down ecosystem.

<br/>
The lawsuit accuses Apple of broad anticompetitive conduct that affects everything from web browsers and messaging to apps and digital payments. According to the DOJ, Apple has made it harder for consumers to switch between smartphone platforms, blocked the development of cloud-based streaming apps, made the cross-platform messaging experience worse, limited the functionality of third-party smartwatches paired to the iPhone, prevented third-party apps from offering tap-to-pay functionality, and more.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When Apple released iOS 18 in September, it introduced an overhauled Photos app, dropping on users the biggest change to photo management on iPhone since the app's introduction. <em>MacRumors</em> forums users have been particularly vocal about the redesign – some have praised the AI features, but others have called for a return to the simpler interface of iOS 17.

The company has made much of Apple Intelligence, so it's no wonder that at the center of Apple's overhaul is an attempt to leverage AI and machine learning to simplify photo organization while introducing a more modern aesthetic.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-11-21 03:21:46-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's base model iPhones have collectively accounted for 42% of its smartphone sales this year, but iPhone Pro Max devices stand as the best-selling individual model, according to new data from <a href="https://cirpapple.substack.com/p/iphone-shapes-and-sizes">Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP)</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964613" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-pro-pro-max.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
The report reveals an interesting sales distribution across Apple's iPhone lineup, but the data needs to be interpreted carefully owing to Apple's tiered product strategy. That's because the company sells several generations of base model iPhones simultaneously at different price points, but it only ever offers a single (current) generation of Pro and Pro Max models. 
<br/>
<br/>
In effect, this means the base model's 42% share represents combined sales across multiple iPhone generations.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            U.S. carrier T-Mobile recently managed to thwart a major network breach before customers were impacted, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-19/t-mobile-said-to-have-caught-hackers-early-averting-data-leak">Bloomberg</a></em>.

<br/>
T-Mobile was able to detect the suspicious activity, blocking hackers from further accessing its systems. There were apparently attempts at getting deeper into the T-Mobile network, but T-Mobile was able to catch the intrusion early so no customer data was compromised. <em>Bloomberg</em> says that people familiar with the situation have confirmed that T-Mobile knows how its network was breached and the access point has been fixed.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If we plot the metrics associated with large DDoS attacks observed in the last 10 years, does it show a straight, steady increase in an exponential curve that keeps becoming steeper, or is it closer to a linear growth? Our analysis found the growth is not linear but rather is exponential, with the slope varying depending on the metric (rps, pps or bps).<br>

<p id="r6yQOi">The latest version of Chrome (Version 131.0.6778.86) has addressed an issue in the browser that broke the ability to highlight text on some websites over the weekend, Google’s Scott Westover confirmed to <em>The Verge </em>in an email. </p>
<p id="3gbVgD">We tested the change, and found that we were able to highlight text within stories on sites like <em>Bloomberg</em> and <em>The Verge</em>, and in the post composer on X, both in updated Windows and Mac versions of Chrome. It’s not clear whether the change applies to other Chromium-based browsers, such as Arc, which continues to be affected in our testing.</p>
