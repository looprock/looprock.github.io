            <p>At the risk of causing undue pride in the community, I want to share a <a class="major" href="https://drewdevault.com/2021/08/05/In-praise-of-Postgres.html" style="text-decoration: underline;">blog post</a> in praise of Postgres.  This early paragraph captures
his sentiments:
</p>
<p><blockquote>
After 25 years of persistence, and a better logo design, Postgres stands today as one of the most significant pillars of profound achievement in free software, alongside the likes of Linux and Firefox.
PostgreSQL has taken a complex problem and solved it to such an effective degree that all of its competitors are essentially obsolete, perhaps with the exception of SQLite.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>And he ends with, "When I think of projects which have made the most significant impacts on the free software ecosystem, and on the world at large, PostgreSQL has a place on that list."

<br/>
In a letter to the Department of Justice, Senator Ron Wyden said foreign officials were demanding the data from the tech giants to track smartphones. The traffic flowing from apps that send push notifications put the companies "in a unique position to facilitate government surveillance of how users are using particular apps," Wyden said. He asked the Department of Justice to "repeal or modify any policies" that hindered public discussions of push notification spying.

            Apple's Korean suppliers have begun developing smartphone under-display cameras (UDC), paving the way for the first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> with a true "all-screen" appearance.

According to <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=24568">The Elec</a></em>, LG Innotek has entered the preliminary development of the UDC, which sits under the display and does not result in a visible hole in the panel when the camera is not in use.

<br/>
A UPC differs from a typical front camera module, since it delivers less light to the image sensor. This is because light loss occurs as it passes through the display area before it reaches the camera lens, which can result in a deterioration in image quality and brightness.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Adventure game "Stray," which is designed to let players take on the role of a daring orange cat, is available for download on the Mac as of today.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Though the game was first released in 2022, it has been limited to Windows machines and PlayStation and Xbox consoles until today.
<br/>
<br/>
In this third-person adventure title, a stray cat's curiosity causes him to get stuck in a walled city filled with robots and mutant bacteria, and the aim in the game is to get back up to the surface using B-12, the cat's drone companion.
<br/>
<br/>
Stray asks players to solve puzzles, bypass obstacles, and complete quests while avoiding security bots and evil bacteria. The game is platform-based, so players will need to climb up various obstacles and interact with the environment to open up new pathways.
<br/>

Since the main character is a cat, players can sneak, sleep, meow at robots, and nuzzle up to NPCs. Stray is limited to Apple silicon Macs, and it [...]<br>

The first version of the ‌iPhone SE‌ came out in March 2016, which means it has been seven years since it launched.

<br/>
The ‌iPhone SE‌ was sold until September 2018, so it has been five years since it was last available for sale, making it eligible for Apple's vintage designation. Products are marked as vintage five years after the device was last sold by Apple, while products are marked as obsolete at the seven year point.
