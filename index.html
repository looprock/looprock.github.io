            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has started preparations for its upcoming September 12 iPhone-centric event, and the official hashmoji for the event has now launched.

Hashmoji, or hashflags as they used to be called, are custom, paid icons that appear next to specific hashtags on the Twitter social network.

The hashmoji features the same Apple logo blue and gray colorway that Apple introduced this morning <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/">when event invites went out</a>.

Sony, the current supplier of micro-OLED displays for Vision Pro, has apparently shown reservations about expanding its production capabilities for the components amid Apple's effort to ramp up mass production of the headset.

            The settlers in Lincoln Island had now regained their dwelling, without having been obliged to reach it by the old opening, and were therefore spared the trouble of mason’s work. It was certainly lucky, that at the moment they were about to set out to do so, the apes had been seized with that terror, no less sudden than inexplicable, which had driven them out of Granite House. Had the animals discovered that they were about to be attacked from another direction? This was the only explanation of their sudden retreat.

During the day the bodies of the apes were carried into the wood, where they were buried; then the settlers busied themselves in repairing the disorder caused by the intruders, disorder but not damage, for although they had turned everything in the rooms topsy-turvy, yet they had broken nothing. Neb relighted his stove, and the stores in the larder furnished a substantial repast, to which all did ample justice.

            <p>As an entrepreneur, I’ve always been fascinated by managers who can set up quasi-autonomous businesses.</p>
<p>\
In contrast to the “<a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/startup">startup culture</a>” that encourages excess, these companies are content to focus on the essentials to generate profits that can be reinvested in thoughtful, controlled growth.</p>
<p>\
Author Paul Jarvis calls these contrarian companies “Company of One,” the title of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Company-One-Staying-Small-Business/dp/0241380227">the book he has dedicated to this entrepreneurship model</a>.</p>
<p>\
<strong>The book defends the thesis that a business doesn’t need to grow at all costs to succeed.</strong></p>

On the contrary, by focusing first on the quality of the service offered to the customer and making a profit, startups can build a more solid foundation for the long term.</p>
