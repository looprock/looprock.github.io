            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus models are widely expected to inherit the Action button first seen on last year's iPhone 15 Pro models. The Action button replaces the traditional Ring/Silent switch – a staple of the iPhone since it launched in 2007. For users unfamiliar with the Action button, here's a rundown of its functions – including some new features that iOS 18 will bring to the table for all iPhone models with an Action button.

<br/>
The Action button replaces the single-function switch used to toggle between ring and silent, offering additional options so users can choose between quickly accessing the camera or flashlight, activate Voice Memos, Focus modes, Translate, and accessibility features like Magnifier. Users can also associate it with Shortcuts for more options.

It won’t work. There are teams here and there that can do it, and they show up at conferences. But, when you're proposing that you're going to "change the culture" of thousands of large organizations, it's an impossible task.

            Sonos won't be able to re-release its old app to appease customers that have been dissatisfied with the new version of the app, Sonos CEO Patrick Spence today said on Reddit <em>(via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224754/sonos-ceo-old-s2-app-re-release-cant-be">The Verge</a>)</em>.

<br/>
Spence said that he was "hopeful" the old app would be able to be re-released up until "very recently" as an alternative for people having issues, but Sonos found that doing so would ultimately make the issues worse because of backend updates to cloud servers and the software that runs on speakers.
