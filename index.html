<br/>
The biggest change is a slick new design for the Now Playing screen, which allows the podcast's full show page art ‚Äì or any episode chapter images ‚Äì to take over the entire screen. 
<br/>
<br/>
The playback controls on the bottom half of the screen have also been rejigged. The play speed button has been moved from the bottom left corner of the screen and now sits next to the rewind button.

            With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> not set to launch until 2024, there's a lot that we don't know about it.

            Apple Maps is catching up with Google Maps on iOS 17 by finally letting iPhone users download maps for offline use. iOS 17 will be released to the public later this year for the iPhone XS and newer, and is currently available in beta for developers.

            <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera is in Cupertino this week to attend WWDC on behalf of the site, and today, he was given an opportunity to try the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> in person.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>
<br/>
Dan is one of the first people who has been able to test the headset, as Apple is only providing these demos to select people who were able to attend the keynote event.
<br/>
<br/>
While Apple did not allow filming of the headset and the usage experience, Dan did a video to recount his thoughts on what it was like and to answer questions from <em>MacRumors</em> readers and viewers.
<br/>

Make sure to watch the video to get Dan's full overview of what it was like using Apple's new wearable for the first time.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: &lt;a href="https</div> [...]<br>
