            The next-generation iPad Air will be equipped with a landscape front camera, according to the <a href="https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1769727515453800930">leaker known as "ShrimpApplePro."</a>

<br/>
If this information is accurate, the front camera on the next iPad Air would be located in the bezel to the right of the screen when the device is held upright. As a result, the front camera would be positioned at the top of the iPad when the device is in landscape orientation, making it centered with the user's eyes during video calls. This change would be especially beneficial to those who use the iPad Air with a Magic Keyboard.
<br/>
<br/>
On the current iPad Air, the front camera is in the top bezel above the screen, resulting in it being off-center in landscape orientation.

            For decades, U.S. broadband providers have struck cozy deals with landlords effectively elbowing out competitors and allowing them to create building-by-building broadband monopolies. That stifled competition results in higher costs, slow speeds, and worse overall service.
