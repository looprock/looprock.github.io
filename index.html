            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            "Stray," an adventure game that lets players take on the role of a cat, will soon be available on the Mac. Introduced in 2022, Stray has previously been limited to Windows machines and PlayStation consoles.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
In Stray, a stray cat finds himself stuck in a walled city filled with robots and mutant bacteria. The cat must make his way back up to the surface with the help of B-12, his drone companion.
<br/>
<br/>
Stray offers third-person gameplay and it requires players to solve puzzles, bypass obstacles, and complete quests while avoiding monsters like Zurks (evil bacteria) and Sentinels (security bots). Much of the game is platform-based, involving climbing up various obstacles and interacting with the environment to open up new pathways. There are cat behaviors too, of course, such as sneaking, sleeping, meowing, and nuzzling up to NPCs to get pets.

As we were gearing up for launch, we wanted to ensure it would go as smoothly as possible.

            Apple plans to add the original 12-inch MacBook to its obsolete products list on June 30, according to an internal memo obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>. Once classified as obsolete, the laptop will no longer be eligible for repairs or service at Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers, as parts will no longer be available.

Apple classifies a product as technologically obsolete once more than seven years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale.

<br/>
At WWDC last year, Apple announced that No Man's Sky would be available for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and Mac would by the end of 2022. Hello Games missed that deadline and the game is finally available for the Mac as of today. Hello Games founder Sean Murray teased two upcoming Apple-related announcements earlier this week. Today, Murray seemingly confirmed that the launch for Mac is one of the two teased announcements, meaning another is soon to follow.

She has to die when the first cold comes, whereas the eggs are to pass the winter in their cozy home. She cannot help deserting the nest. But, if the hatching were earlier and took place in the Spider’s life, I imagine that she would be as devoted to her family as a Bird is. So I gather from the behavior of a shapely Spider who weaves no webs, lies in wait for her prey, and walks sideways, like a Crab.<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-05-31 13:22:56-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Popular virtual reality rhythm game Beat Saber could be one title that Apple is planning to promote for its upcoming AR/VR headset, according to a tweet shared by Beat Games co-founder Jaroslav Beck.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Beck today shared a tweet about June 5th, saying that the date would be "🍿🕶️," which seems to hint that a version of Beat Saber for the Apple AR/VR headset could perhaps be part of Apple's presentation. Beat Saber for Apple's platform is just speculation at this point, but Beck does not regularly tweet about Apple, and would seemingly have no reason to comment on the event.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Popular Reddit app Apollo might not be able to operate as is in the future due to planned API pricing that Reddit is implementing.

<br/>
Apollo developer Christian Selig <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/">was today told</a> that Reddit plans to charge $12,000 for 50 million API requests.

            Apple today seeded the second beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-13/">macOS Ventura</a> 13.5 to developers for testing purposes, with the beta introduced two weeks after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/19/macos-ventura-13-5-beta-1/">release of the first beta</a>.

Registered developers can download the beta through the Apple Developer Center and after the appropriate profile is installed, with the betas available through the Software Update mechanism in System Settings.

<br/>
No notable features were found in the first beta of macOS 13.5, so it's not yet clear what's included in the update. iOS 16.6 lays the groundwork for iMessage Contact Key Verification, so if that feature ultimately launches in the iOS 16.6 update, iMessage Contact Key Verification will also be includ [...]<br>
