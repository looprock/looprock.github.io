            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-06 06:26:41-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Remember when 16GB felt like an ocean of storage on the original iPhone? Those were simpler times. Apple initially offered the OG device in storage capacities of 4GB and 8GB, but just months after launching, Apple nixed the 4GB model, eventually replacing it with a 16GB option. Fast forward to 2025, and Apple offers 128GB as the base storage tier for most iPhone 16 models. That might sound like a lot by comparison, but it's becoming genuinely problematic for users caught in an increasingly aggressive AI storage squeeze.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-06 03:55:00-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When Apple released iOS 18.2, it introduced a major change to the Mail app with its new Categories and priority messages features.

The change also adds contact photos and business logos for conversations in your inbox, but if you don't like how they look, it's easy enough to make them go away.

<br/>
Contact photos have been added to the Mail app in an effort to make it easier to identify the senders of all the emails you receive. However, if Apple can't recognize a business, or a contact doesn't have an associated photo, it can end up making your inbox look a bit of a mess.
