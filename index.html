            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iMessage will avoid regulation requiring interoperability with other messaging platforms under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), following the conclusion of an investigation by the regulator (via <em><em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-13/apple-imessage-microsoft-bing-dodge-eu-s-big-tech-crackdown">Bloomberg</a></em></em>).

<br/>
The probe concluded that the iMessage platform and Microsoft's Bing do not hold a dominant enough position to be brought under the DMA's strict rules for services provided by big tech's so-called digital "gatekeepers," which include Apple, Meta, Google, Amazon, and TikTok, according to the EU.

Apple and Microsoft said they welcomed the decision to not designate them as core platform services in separate statements following the announcement.

<p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mALo4B">I was recently sitting in a hot tub with a friend — a glaciologist who studies how quickly the southern ice is sliding into the sea — when she mentioned that she had recently planned her honeymoon using ChatGPT. Our fellow bathers burst into laughter. “You’d done it, too?” This, apparently, is the present state of get-togethers among friends in their early 30s: six people and three AI-assisted honeymoons between them.</p>

<p id="b4IJbE">AI, once an ambiguous science fiction trope, has become an ambiguous business buzzword, as every technology product races to implement what Silicon Valley thinks is the greatest innovation since the internet. But lost in the conversation are stories about the people building it and using it. If large language models and automated systems will, indeed, upend labor and capital, what does it actually look like in practice?
