            Apple co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, so today would have marked his 71st birthday if he hadn't passed away in 2011 at the age of 56.

<br/>
In 1976, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak co-founded Apple Computer Company to market Wozniak's Apple I, a pioneering personal computer. Their collaboration led to the introduction of the Apple II in 1977, which significantly influenced the personal computing industry. 
<br/>
<br/>
In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, notable for its graphical user interface and the iconic "1984" Super Bowl commercial directed by Ridley Scott. However, internal conflicts led to Jobs' departure from Apple in 1985. He then founded NeXT Inc., focusing on advanced computer platforms.

            Apple CEO Tim Cook was among a handful of top tech executives who attended a classified CIA briefing warning that China could attack Taiwan by 2027, according to a sweeping investigative report by <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/24/technology/taiwan-china-chips-silicon-valley-tsmc.html">The New York Times</a></em> ($).

<br/>
The previously unreported briefing was apparently held in a secure room in Silicon Valley in July 2023. The meeting is said to have been arranged at the request of the then-commerce secretary Gina Raimondo, who had grown frustrated with the tech industry's reluctance to move chip production away from Taiwan.

The gains came even as the broader European smartphone market declined by 1% to 134.2 million units, which Omdia says was weighed down by softer demand and new regulations around eco-design requirements and mandatory USB-C ports.

            <b>Published:</b> 2026-02-22 10:22:00+01:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Most organizations treat infrastructure as a series of projects to be &ldquo;completed,&rdquo; but successful platform engineering requires a permanent product mindset. In this episode, we explore why platform teams need dedicated product management to balance competing priorities—like security, cost, and developer experience—and why the &ldquo;why&rdquo; scales much better than the &ldquo;what&rdquo; in large enterprises. We also dive into the often-overlooked role of designers in creating platform tools that developers actually want to use.</p>
<p>Tanzu Catsup is a weekly conversation about platform engineering, cloud-native operations, and building software in large organizations. We follow the work wherever it actually leads.</p>

Salesforce sells application logic – workflows, configurations, business rules. Oracle sells infrastructure – databases, middleware, cloud compute. The application layer was always the vulnerable part. The infrastructure layer was always the durable part. Software ate the world. Then it sat around all gluttonous and bloated.

<p>It is especially bad when you hook it up to other services like docs and email.</p>
