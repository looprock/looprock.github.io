            Apple today seeded the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/12/apple-seeds-ios-26-3-beta-2/">second beta of iOS 26.3</a>, nearly a month after the first beta. So far, the update includes a couple of new features for iPhones.

<br/>
iOS 15.3 through iOS 18.3 were all released in late January over the years, so it is thereby likely that iOS 26.3 will be released towards the end of this month as well. The update is compatible with the iPhone 11 series and newer.

            <b>Published:</b> 2026-01-12 12:51:08-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/retail/regentstreet/">flagship Regent Street store</a> in London, England is temporarily closed starting today for "refurbishment," the company said on its website.

<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031945" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/Apple-Regent-Street.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
Apple has not indicated when the store will reopen, but a source familiar with the matter indicated that the location will likely be closed for at least a few weeks. It is unclear if Apple is planning any changes that will be visible to customers, but the company has been removing the Video Wall from some of it stores in recent months. Many newer and renovated stores also feature a dedicated Apple Pickup station for online orders.
<br/>
<br/>
In some cases, Apple only updates a store's fixtures or back-of-house area, resulting in no visible differences to customers when business resumes.

            Elon Musk today expressed concern about Apple and Google partnering on a more personalized version of Siri powered by Google's generative AI platform Gemini.

"This seems like an unreasonable concentration of power for Google, given that [they] also have Android and Chrome," wrote Musk, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2010785742427979894">in a post on X</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Musk serves as CEO of xAI, the company behind Gemini competitor Grok.

It is unlikely that Apple or Google will publicly respond to Musk's comment, but we will update this story if the companies have anything to say.

            On iOS 18.2 and later, there is a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/apple-announces-airtag-location-sharing/">Share Item Location feature in the Find My app</a> that allows you to temporarily share the location of an AirTag-equipped item with others, including employees at participating airlines. This way, if you put an AirTag inside your bags, the airline can better help you find them in the event they are lost or delayed at the airport.

            A detailed new report from <a href="https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/apple-tsmc-the-partnership-that-built"><em>SemiAnalysis</em></a> argues that while Apple's partnership with TSMC created the modern leading-edge foundry model, the rapid rise of AI computing is changing who pays for new chip technologies and how much influence Apple holds over each new manufacturing node.

The report traces how Apple became the single most important customer in the global semiconductor industry by committing early and at scale to new manufacturing processes at TSMC, beginning with the A8 chip in 2014. It argues that Apple's willingness to absorb early costs, fund yield improvements, and align its annual product cycle with TSMC's roadmap allowed the foundry to outpace rivals and cement its dominance at the leading edge.

            Google has confirmed that its Chrome 150 browser update coming later this year will be the last version to support macOS Monterey. Going forward, Chrome 151 and later versions will no longer support macOS 12, which Apple released in October 2021.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple emerged as the global smartphone market leader in 2025, capturing a 20% market share with 10% year-over-year shipment growth – the highest among the top five brands, according to data released today by <a href="https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/global-smartphone-shipments-grew-2-percent-YoY-in-2025">Counterpoint Research</a>.

<br/>
Global smartphone shipments grew 2% year-over-year in 2025, marking the second consecutive year of growth. Counterpoint said the market was driven by more consumers taking advantage of financing options to upgrade to premium devices, as well as increasing adoption of 5G devices in emerging markets.

Samsung ranked second behind Apple with a 19% market share and modest 5% shipment growth, while Xiaomi retained third place with 13% share.

            Apple and other smartphone manufacturers are resisting an Indian government proposal that would require them to hand over source code for security review, reports <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/india-proposes-forcing-smartphone-makers-give-source-code-security-overhaul-2026-01-11/">Reuters</a></em>.

<br/>
The proposal is included in a package of 83 security standards that India is considering as legal requirements, as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's efforts to boost security of user data following increases in online fraud and data breaches in the country. 
<br/>
<br/>
Beyond routine measures like notifying the government of major updates and storing security audit logs, the standards would force manufacturers to hand over source code to government-designated labs to check for vulnerabilities.

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Cowen’s core claim is simple and sharp: in the US, most people won’t lose jobs <em>to AI</em>, they’ll lose them to <em>other people who use AI better</em>. The real bottleneck isn’t models or GPUs - it’s institutions, habits, status hierarchies, and people’s unwillingness to adapt. The transition will be slow, uneven, and psychologically unpleasant, but materially beneficial.</p>
<p>Here’s a structured take, pulling the signal out of the transcript.</p>
<p>1 <strong>AI isn’t killing jobs directly - it’s reshuffling competition.</strong></p>
<p>Cowen’s line worth remembering: <em>“The threat to your job is not AI, it’s some other person who uses AI better than you do."</em> In the US, he expects fewe</p> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Feeding the decades of Gartner research into some kind of AI querying thing would be interesting. Making sense of their reports takes a lot of time, and multi-year trends are hard to pick out. Writing into a chat window that was updated with not only the research reports, but also analyst opinions - maybe notes after inquiry meetings, etc.</p>
<p>I have never been a big user of their inquiry service, but I have a feeling that combining a AI-made custom report/chat session with a human follow up would be something new and valuable.</p>
<p>That said, from what Gartner people have told me over the years, every year they try to do The New Thing (social, video, now AI?) and it never really takes off. Classic innovator’s dilemma I guess.</p>
<p>Also, what I think would be very useful for Gartner to do is setup labs and actually run enterprise software, like a Consumer Reports. Having some benchmarks (common use cases) for incompressible things like comparing different CRM/HR systems, or Kubernetes “d</p> [...]<br>

That creates recursive trust loops where “explain your reasoning” becomes an attack surface, and models can literally talk themselves out of being secure.
