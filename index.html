            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-12 11:35:27-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/mac/2024-mac-mini-macbook-pro">added MacBook Pro and Mac mini models with M4 series chips</a> to its certified refurbished store in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Ireland for the first time since the computers were introduced in October 2024. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973630" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/M4-mini-Glowing-Blue.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Some refurbished MacBook Pro models with M4 chips are also available in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and select other European countries.
<br/>
<br/>
As usual for refurbished Macs, prices are discounted by approximately 15% compared to the equivalent new models on Apple's online store. Note that Apple's refurbished inventory changes often, and the order button is still grayed out for some configurations in some countries, so keep checking back if you are eyeing a particular model.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is exploring both humanoid and non-humanoid robots as future smart home products, according to Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. However, he does not expect the robots to launch for several more years, if ever.

<br/>
Kuo today <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1889694419907125342">said</a> Apple's robot projects remain in the proof-of-concept stage within the company. In the event that Apple decides to move forward with launching the robots, Kuo believes that mass production likely won't begin until 2028 or later. 
<br/>
<br/>
Kuo's prediction comes after a team of robotics researchers at Apple designed and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/06/apple-prototypes-tabletop-robot/">prototyped a lamp-like robot</a> with lifelike movements.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-12 04:48:12-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's designs on its first foldable device appear to have ramped up a notch, with the company said to be tapping suppliers of ultra-thin glass (UTG).
<br/>

<br/>
Chinese manufacturer Lens Technology is set to become Apple's primary supplier of UTG for upcoming foldable devices, according to a new report from <em>The Elec</em> (via <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250212PD209/utg-apple-foldable-supplier-production.html"><em>DigiTimes</em></a>). The company is expected to secure approximately 70% of Apple's UTG orders, with US-based Corning likely to provide the raw materials.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-02-12 04:30:39-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Google appears to be tackling one of smartphones' most persistent design quirks – the camera bump. According to leaked renders published by <em><a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-9a-renders-colors">Android Headlines</a></em>, the upcoming Pixel 9A will feature an almost flush camera housing, which would be a significant departure from the bumper-sized camera bumps common in modern smartphones.

<br/>
The mid-range device's camera module sits nearly level with the phone's chassis, based on side-view renders. That said, the design choice comes with at least one trade-off in camera specifications, as the Pixel 9A will reportedly feature a 48MP main lens, down from the 64MP sensor in its predecessor, the Pixel 8A. The phone will retain a 13MP ultrawide lens and a 13MP front-facing camera, according to the outlet.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iPhone 16 Pro Max has been comprehensively beaten by the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra in a real world app speed test conducted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qNCj8aE6Q">PhoneBuff</a>, with the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip and 12GB of RAM winning out over the A18 Pro chip and 8GB of RAM in Apple's smartphone.

<br/>

<br/>
The performance test measured how long it took each phone to open and process tasks across a series of apps. Each smartphone cycled through identical apps, including Facebook, Starbucks, Microsoft Office apps, Snapseed, and various games.
<br/>
<br/>
The Galaxy S25 Ultra established an early lead through productivity apps and maintained its advantage in image editing tasks, with Snapseed exports completing significantly faster than on the iPhone. Most notably, the Galaxy processed video in LumaFusion approximately 25% faster than the iPhone 16 Pro Max – an area where Apple's smartphones have traditionally excelled.
