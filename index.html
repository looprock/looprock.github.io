            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            It looks like Apple's foldable iPhone will have some "crease-free" competition.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1945871948468404342">said</a> Samsung's next-generation Galaxy Z Fold 8 will use the same laser-drilled metal display plate as the foldable iPhone, with the component to be supplied by South Korean company Fine M-Tec.
<br/>
<br/>
Samsung's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/samsung-galaxy-z-fold7/">new Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> still has a visible crease in the middle of its inner screen. However, Kuo said that Apple's stricter crease-free requirement for the foldable iPhone has essentially raised the bar for foldable devices, so it sounds like next year's Galaxy Z Fold 8 will feature a "crease-free" screen as well.

Both the cat and the woman are upset with the change, so he undoes it, demonstrating the reversible nature of the feature.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            A new rumor out of China today has sparked speculation that Apple may be readying a unique new iPhone 17 Pro color that somehow reflects the new design language of its iOS 26 software.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1011198" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iPhone-17-Pro-Iridescent-Feature-2.5.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://t.co/nBP4VF7qri">Instant Digital</a> on Thursday hinted that the iPhone 17 Pro has a "special" color variant that is said to be "connected to the iOS 26 Liquid Glass design." 
<br/>
<br/>
The leaker, who only claims to have heard of it but not seen it, seems to believe that the color is what previous leaks have simply referred to as white, "but it appears differently depending on the lighting." 
<br/>
<br/>
While speculative, a white base material that subtly shifts hues depending on light and angle could add a dynamic, refractive quality to the color. Combined with the Liquid Glass UI [...]<br>

            Development studio CD Projekt Red today released acclaimed role-playing action game <em><a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/us/en/">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a></em> for the Mac, and it looks like the developers have gone all-out to make the experience as impressive as possible for Mac gamers with the right hardware.

<br/>
The 2020 triple-A game has been Metal API-optimized for a variety of Macs with Apple silicon, from the first M1 models right up to the latest M4 models. The only caveat is that <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> requires a minimum of 16GB of RAM to play, so 8GB M1 and M2 chips don't get a look in.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            You may have missed it, but select Apple Watch models are gaining a new Wrist Flick gesture in watchOS 26 that allows users to dismiss notifications and return to their watch face with a simple wrist movement.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1007304" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/watchos-26-gradient-light.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
The gesture works by turning your wrist over and back, using the accelerometer and gyroscope to detect the motion. With the gesture, you can dismiss incoming notifications, mute calls, silence alarms and alerts, and return to the watch face without needing to use your other hand.
<br/>
<br/>
Wrist Flick joins the existing Double Tap gesture as another one-handed control option for Apple Watch users. The feature can be toggled on or off in Settings ➝ Gestures ➝ Wrist Flick.
