<p id="ZcGGw9">In 2024, you can go onto YouTube, one of the most popular media distributors in the United States and the world, and you can pull up Janet Jackson’s 2004 performance at the Super Bowl. There are videos with her whole 11-minute performance and others that show only the three seconds that shook the country. Justin Timberlake, standing to Jackson’s left and singing “better have you naked / by the end of this song” from his song “Rock Your Body,” reaches across her body, grabs her garment, and yanks. A “wardrobe malfunction” ensues, and instead of revealing a pretty red bra, you — for not even a full second — see her nearly bare breast, a star-sh</p> [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-10-16 13:30:30-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's chief people officer Carol Surface is leaving the company, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-16/apple-s-chief-people-officer-to-exit-after-less-than-two-years">Bloomberg</a></em>. Surface joined Apple in February 2023, so she has been at the company less than two years.

<br/>
Most senior executives are at Apple for much longer periods of time, and it is not clear why Surface is leaving. She was hired when Apple decided to split its primary human resources role from retail last year, and she reported directly to Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Deirdre O'Brien had been handling both the retail and people (or HR) role, but when Surface took over, O'Brien transitioned to just overseeing retail. With Surface leaving, O'Brien will once agai [...]<br>

Most paid services were providing a few megabytes of space, and here came Google promising a full gigabyte (which, at the time, seemed huge) for free. I switched to Gmail in 2005, not long after it was first introduced (at least, April of that year is the earliest email I can find in my first account), and I — along with a <em>lot</em> of other users — haven’t looked back since. </p>
