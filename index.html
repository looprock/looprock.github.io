            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Yesterday we noted that the new iPad mini 7 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/whats-in-the-ipad-mini-7-box/">does not come with a charger</a> in the box when sold in European countries, and it turns out that the same now also applies to entry-level iPads sold by Apple across the continent.

<br/>
Since its release in 2022, Apple's most affordable iPad has come with a USB-C charger in Europe, but the debut of the new iPad mini on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/apple-unveils-new-ipad-mini-apple-intelligence/">Tuesday</a> would have left it as the only remaining device in the lineup to do so. The latest iPad Pro and iPad Air models, introduced earlier this year, do not include a charger in the box when purchased in Europe. All of these devices only include a USB-C cable.

<p id="t9rzau">In February 2004, a 19-year-old, flip-flop-wearing Mark Zuckerberg released an online directory of Harvard students. In those days, the internet still felt small. It was mostly about finding webpages, not people.</p>
<p id="KrjU3A">It turned out that the internet was very good for connecting people. More than 1,000 Harvard students signed up for TheFacebook.com in the first 24 hours. The site started spreading quickly by word of mouth around campus. By the end of 2004, dozens of other colleges were on Facebook. The site had 1 million monthly users.

The Office for Product Safety and Standards, part of the Department for Business and Trade, is seeking input from manufacturers, importers, distributors, and trade associations on the potential benefits and challenges of implementing a common charging standard across the UK.

This move comes after the EU passed legislation in 2022 requiring most portable electronic devices to use USB-C for charging by December 2024. The EU's decision aimed to reduce elec [...]<br>

The Arc Ultra offers up to double the bass of its predecessor, thanks to new transducer technology called Sound Motion.

            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/apple-unveils-new-ipad-mini-apple-intelligence/">new iPad mini 7</a> does not come with a charger in the box in European countries, including the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, and others. This change is likely in response to EU regulations regarding electronic waste that will be enforced starting in 2026, but even some European countries that are not part of the EU are impacted.

<br/>
The latest iPad Pro and iPad Air models, introduced earlier this year, also do not come with a charger in the box in Europe.
<br/>
<br/>
The lack of a charger in the box with iPads only applies to Europe for the time being. Apple includes a 20W USB-C charger with the iPad mini 7 in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Japan, Brazil, and other countries around the world.

            A favorite tactic of U.S. corporations looking to dismantle consumer protection reforms (or anything they don&#8217;t like, really) is to create entirely fake consumer groups custom-built to confuse voters and journalists.

In a <a href="https://weibo.com/1833340431/OBysCwunm">Weibo post</a> on Tuesday, Chinese-language user "Phone Chip Expert" said Apple's A20 chip in iPhone 18 models will switch from the previous InFo (Integrated Fan-Out) packaging to WMCM (Wafer-Level Multi-Chip Module) packaging, while memory will be upgraded to 12GB.

In terms of the differences in packaging method, InFo allows integration of components, including memory, within the package but focuses more on single-die packaging where memory is typically attached to the main SoC (such as DRAM placed on top or near th [...]<br>

<p id="8Fl29v">Before a podcast was a “podcast,” it was… well, it wasn’t really much of anything. A few of the early believers called them “audio blogs,” and the journalist often credited with coining the term “podcast” also offered “GuerillaMedia” as an alternative in the very same article. (And actually, there’s plenty of debate over exactly who coined the term and when. The history of the podcast is more contentious than you’d think.)</p>
<p id="t4xdEo">It was in 2004, though, that many of the earliest names in on-demand audio began to smush “iPod” and “broadcast” into the word we’ve come to know as the way we all download and listen to shows now.

There’s a lot to reckon with — including braces and bootcut jeans, in my case — and you get a sense of what kinds of moments you thought were worth preserving. Apparently, a great deal of funny things happened to my friends and me as we loafed around a suburban coffee shop avoiding homework. Looking through those pages, I can find plenty of documentation of life as we waited for our teammates to finish their tennis matches and turned the communal couch at Caribou Coffee into our own private rec room.

Thousands of people, maybe tens of thousands, would immediately come to your site — and there’s a good chance they’d crash it in the process. Hundreds of commenters would debate the merits of whatever you’d created or published, pick fights with you and each other about it, and make you feel like the internet’s main character. At least for a few minutes, until something bigger and newer and more controversial hit Digg.com and everyone moved on.</p>
