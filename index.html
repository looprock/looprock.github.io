            iOS 17 includes several improvements to the Health app, including new <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/health/">mental health and vision health features</a>. Another useful addition to the app is follow-up reminders for scheduled medications, in case you forget to mark them as taken.

<br/>
When the setting is turned on, the Health app will send you follow-up reminders if you have not logged a medication 30 minutes after the initial notification. There is also an option to have follow-up reminders sent as critical alerts that appear on the Lock Screen and play a sound, even if a Focus mode is turned on or the iPhone is muted.

iOS 17 is available in beta for members of Apple's Developer Program, and will be released to the public later this year for the iPhone XS and newer.&lt;div class="l [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-06-06 04:07:16-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's stock Notes app got hardly any screen time during yesterday's WWDC keynote, but one powerful addition to the app in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> is a new ability to link notes and connect related notes together.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898679" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/linking-notes-ios-17.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
With just a few taps, you can create links between notes, making it easy to jump from one idea to another. Long press on a space in any note, and a new "Add Link" option can be found in the pop-up menu. Tapping it lets you link to another note by searching its title or entering a URL. 
<br/>
<br/>
You can create an optional alternative title for the link, or just stick with the original title for clarity. Once you're done, the link appears as hyperlink-style underlined text in your note, and tapping it snaps you straight into the note you linked to.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is making contact and password sharing a lot easier in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> by letting users insert them into any text field they encounter in the system.

<br/>
When long pressing in a text box, a new "Insert" option appears in the pop-up menu. Tapping it brings up another menu with two additional new options: "Contacts" and "Passwords."
<br/>
<br/>
Choosing Contacts takes you straight to your contacts list for you to make your selection, while tapping Password takes you to your passwords keychain after authentication.
