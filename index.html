Kuo said mass production of Apple's smart home camera is scheduled to begin in 2026, and the company apparently aims to sell tens of millions of them over the long term.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-11-11 18:40:23-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple TV+ today shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceYm0eDw7tg">recap video</a> for the first season of the hit series "Silo," which returns for a second season starting later this week.
<br/>
<br/>
Warning: The video contains major spoilers, obviously.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
"Silo" follows the last 10,000 people on Earth, all of whom live in a massive underground bunker to escape the seemingly toxic and deadly world outside. The people are unaware of why the silo was built, and those who seek the truth face deadly consequences. Rebecca Ferguson stars as Juliette Nichols, an engineer who attempts to unravel the mysteries surrounding the silo following a loved one's murder. The sci-fi series is based on Hugh Howey's best-selling book trilogy "Wool." Ferguson and Howey both serve as executive producers.
<br/>
<br/>
The 10-episode second season of "Silo" begins this Friday, November 15, and one new episode will follow every Friday through January 17.

<br/>
The expensive price tag is partly due to the fact that luxury company Assouline is only selling 1,500 copies of the book, each with a hand-printed number. The hardcover book also features a "sleek translucent slipcase" and "gold-edged pages." As an act of generosity, Assouline even includes complimentary shipping on orders above $200!

Seriously, though, this book is fancy:<blockquote>Every book comes in a custom-designed translucent acrylic slipcase etched with the Apple Music logo, while the linen hardcover is</blockquote> [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-11-11 16:53:16-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple seeded the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/apple-releases-ios-18-2-beta-3-and-more/">third betas of iOS 18.2 and iPadOS 18.2</a> to developers for testing today. While the third betas of each update are minor relative to the first two betas, there are still a handful of changes across the Photos app, TV app, and more.

<br/>
A corresponding iOS 18.2 public beta with these changes will likely be released later this week, and Apple previously confirmed that the software update <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-confirms-ios-18-2-december-launch/">will be released to the public in December</a>. iOS 18.2 is compatible with the iPhone XS series and newer, but Apple Intelligence features require an iPhone 15 Pro model or any iPhone 16.
