<br/>
This is the first ‌Mac Studio‌ refresh since the desktop computer was updated with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Max and ‌M2‌ Ultra chip options in June 2023. The overall design of the machine has not changed. The front of the computer has two Thunderbolt 5 or USB-C ports depending on the configuration, and an SD card slot, while the rear side has four Thunderbolt 5 ports, an HDMI port, a 10-Gigabit Ethernet port, two USB-A ports, a headphone jack, a power cord connector, and a power button.

Ahead of time, the first reviews of the laptop have been shared by selected publications and YouTube channels, offering a closer look at new features and changes.

<br/>
While it is a minor spec-bump year for the MacBook Air, the new model does offer a few upgrades beyond the M4 chip. There is an improved 12-megapixel camera with support for <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111102">Center Stage</a>, support for two external displays even when the MacBook Air's lid is open, Thunderbolt 4 ports, and a new Sky Blue color option.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When Apple released the second macOS 15.4 beta earlier this month, the company apparently made a change that means System Settings no longer shows how much local storage space Apple Intelligence features are taking up on a Mac.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
In macOS Sequoia 15.3.1, users with a Mac powered by Apple silicon can easily discover how much space any installed Apple Intelligence features are taking up on their drive by going to System Settings ➝ General ➝ Storage, and then clicking the circled "i" button next to macOS.
<br/>
<br/>
That hasn't been the case since the beta 2 release of Apple's upcoming macOS Sequoia 15.4 update. As <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1899233160858386432">spotted</a> by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris, when users click the "i" button, no further details are now given to explai [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is expected to release iOS 18.4 in early April, and when it does, users with HomeKit devices still running on the old Home app architecture may be forced to upgrade them to the latest software.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Apple has offered users the option to upgrade to new Home architecture since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/28/apple-makes-new-home-upgrade-available/">March 2023</a> when it released iOS 16.4, iPadOS 16.4, and macOS Ventura 13.3. At the time, Apple said the new architecture brings faster, more reliable performance, especially for smart homes with a lot of smart accessories installed. 
<br/>
<br/>
However, not all users were entirely convinced of its stability, mainly because it was actually the return of the update's availability after Apple temporarily &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/21/apple-pull [...]<br>
