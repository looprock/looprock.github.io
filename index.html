<br/>
Apple says that the Vision Pro specifically weighs between 21.2 and 22.9 ounces (600 and 650 grams) depending on which Light Seal and head band is used on the device. The separate battery weighs 12.5 ounces (353 grams). For reference, this means that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, excluding the battery, weighs almost as much as a 12.9-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, which comes in at 24 ounces (682 grams).

<br/>
Custom wording of the customer's choice can be engraved into the black plastic sides of the optional ZEISS lens inserts designed for those who normally wear glasses or contact lenses. The option is probably intended to help multiple users identify which lens inserts belong to them, rather than be a novel way to personalize the device, since they are very small and there is no other engraving option for the Vision Pro.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            We&#8217;ve long established that U.S. broadband is expansive, patchy, and slow thanks to mindless consolidation, regulatory capture, regional monopolization, and limited competition. That&#8217;s resulted in a growing number of towns, cities, cooperatives, and city-owned utilities building their own, locally-owned and operated broadband networks in a bid for better, cheaper, faster broadband. Regional giants like Comcast, [&#8230;]<br>

            Field drug tests often seem to be more a triumph of imagination than a triumph of science. They&#8217;re cheap. Some popular tests run less than $3/per.
