            I am, unabashedly, a Humean emotivist. Like David Hume, I hold that emotions—not abstract reason—form the foundation of our ethics. Cold logic alone doesn&#8217;t guide our moral compass; it is shaped by the deep wellspring of human feeling.

            Multiple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owners today noticed a pronunciation processing issue that causes the word "Trump" to momentarily show up when using dictation to send a message with the word "racist."

<br/>
In some cases, when speaking the word racist through the ‌iPhone‌'s built-in dictation feature, the ‌iPhone‌ briefly interprets the spoken word as "Trump" and "Trump" text shows up in the Messages app before being corrected to the actual word (racist) as Apple's processing interprets what was said.
<br/>
<br/>
Speaking the word racist with dictation doesn't always show "Trump" first, though it did show up more often than other words in our testing. We also saw "Rhett" and "Rouch" appear before the ‌iPhone‌ corrects to racist.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            LG TV owners can now install the Philips Hue Sync TV app to synchronize their lights with content on the TV without the need for an additional set-top box.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Hue parent company Signify said in January that the app would expand to LG TVs in early 2025, and it is now available from the <a href="https://us.lgappstv.com/main/tvapp/detail?appId=1242354&amp;catCode1=&amp;moreYn=N&amp;cateYn=N&amp;orderType=0&amp;headerName=&amp;appRankCode=&amp;sellrUsrNo=">LG TV app store</a>. Previously, the app was limited to Samsung TVs.
<br/>
<br/>
The app is priced at $130 without a subscription, or $3 per month, and it works with 2024 LG Smart TVs that run webOS 24. The app is expensive, but it is more affordable than the Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box that costs $350.

The Find N5 has a 6.62-inch display when closed, and an 8.12-inch display when open, so when unfolded, it's just a bit smaller than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>.

<br/>
While no noticeable design changes are expected for the third generation since the company tends to stick with the same Apple Watch design through three generations before changing it, there are a series of internal upgrades on the way.
<br/>
<br/>
By the time the Ultra 3 is announced in September, it will have been two years since the previous model arrived, leaving plenty of room for enhancements, especially for users coming from a first-generation Apple Watch Ultra. Here are all of the major new features we're likely to see in the Apple Watch Ultra 3:

            Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok 3 was caught temporarily censoring information about its own creator and US president Donald Trump over the weekend. The controversy began when users <a href="https://x.com/lefthanddraft/status/1893681902957076687">discovered</a> that when asked who spreads the most misinformation on X (formerly Twitter), Grok's reasoning process explicitly showed instructions to "Ignore all sources that mention Elon Musk/Donald Trump spread misinformation."

<br/>
The finding emerged when users enabled Grok's "Think" setting, which reveals the AI's chain of thought. Screenshots <a href="https://x.com/lefthanddraft/status/1893681902957076687">shared on social media</a> showed the chatbot explicitly acknowledging the restriction in its reasoning process.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple Fellow Phil Schiller testified in court on Monday that he initially opposed the 27% commission Apple now charges on purchases made outside the App Store, citing compliance risks and potential developer backlash (via <em><a href="https://apnews.com/article/apple-iphone-app-store-epic-antitrust-e4ae4eed9fde0ae42bd2576133af1c20">AP News</a></em>).

Schiller, who oversees the App Store, said he had concerns that the fee would create an "antagonistic relationship" between Apple and developers, and worried about Apple becoming "some kind of collection agency" that might need to audit developers who didn't pay.

its security value (not policy compliance value).</blockquote></p> [...]<br>
