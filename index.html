            The 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference will take place the week of June 9 to June 13, and like the last five years, it will be an online event, although select developers and students will be invited to Apple Park. To kick things off, Apple holds a keynote event on the Monday to announce new software, which is what makes it of interest to the general public.

<br/>
During the keynote event on Monday, June 9, Apple is expected to unveil iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, watchOS 26, and visionOS 26. (Apple is changing the naming for its operating system updates –  the "26" represents the September 2025 to September 2026 release season.) The company may also preview its new homeOS operating system, the platform that powers its long-rumored smart home hub.

            While the so-called "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>" is not expected to launch until September, there are already plenty of rumors about the ultra-thin device.

While the device is expected to have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/22/iphone-17-air-thinness-video/">impressively thin and light design</a>, rumors indicate it will have some compromises compared to iPhone 17 Pro models, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-17-air-battery-case-report/">worse battery life</a>, only a single rear camera, only a single speaker, and an A19 chip instead of an A19 Pro chip.

            Apple's upcoming HomePod Software 26 update will support the original first-generation HomePod along with all succeeding HomePod models, according to a private account on X with a proven track record for upcoming software updates.

<br/>
Apple released the original HomePod eight years ago, so it's good to see that Apple's latest software will support it. As for what the new software will bring to the table in terms of new features, it's not yet clear, but hopefully improvements to the Siri experience are forthcoming.
<br/>
<br/>
Rather than naming the next-generation version HomePod Software 19, Apple is likely to call it HomePod Software 26. All of the major software updates coming this year will be numbered "26," reflecting the September 2025 to September 2026 release cycle, so it'd be weird for the HomePod Software not  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Nintendo Switch 2 includes a new built-in social feature called GameChat that allows up to 12 users to engage in video chats simultaneously, even if they're playing in different games. To facilitate this, Nintendo offers an official Switch 2 Camera that connects via USB-C, but it turns out that an iPhone does the job just as well, if not better.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Niles Mitchell has thoughtfully <a href="https://youtu.be/wGH_VF-Gx4Y">shared a demo</a> of the Switch-iPhone configuration that explains how to set it up. You'll need a HDMI to USB-C cable and a HDMI converter cable to connect them, which should cost around $30 in total.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-05 16:38:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            tvOS is probably the Apple operating system that gets the fewest updates each year, and that's not going to change in 2025. But thanks to the design overhaul that Apple is introducing across all of its software platforms, tvOS is set to get some interesting new features.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003300" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/tvOS-26-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
<h2>Naming</h2>
<br/>
As we've noted several times this week, Apple is changing the naming for its operating system updates. After tvOS 18, we're getting tvOS 26 instead of tvOS 19. The "26" represents the September 2025 to September 2026 release season for tvOS, with Apple planning to use the same numbering across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and visionOS too.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Updated Design</h2>
<br/>
The visionOS-style design update that's coming to iOS, iPadOS, and macOS will also extend to tvOS. tvOS tends to get little attention comparatively so we d [...]<br>
