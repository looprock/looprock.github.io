            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            This tutorial guides you on creating a dynamic C# Web API using Dapper for data access. Dapper simplifies database access by allowing dynamic SQL queries and object mapping. The project performs CRUD operations on a "Tasks" table in a SQL Server Compact Edition database. It covers setting up the project, implementing HTTP methods for CRUD operations, and using HttpClient to test the API. This foundation can be expanded for more complex Web API projects with additional features and security measures as needed.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Stacked PRs might initially seem like more work due to the need to break down changes into smaller parts. However, the increase in code review efficiency, faster feedback loops, and enhanced learning opportunities will surely outweigh this overhead. 

As we continue embracing the shift-left principles, stacked PRs will become increasingly useful.

The Aviator CLI provides a great way to manage stacked PRs with a lot less tedium. The CLI is open-source and completely free. We would love for you to try it out, and share your feedback on our discussion board.<br>

1. Made a site for tracking what all the Large Language Models know about your name. Called it "Have I Been Encoded" because why not use a nerdy name like the haveibeenpwned project?

2. Realized the name sucks and I should also rather focus on brands instead and called it "SEO for AI" - another technical and nerdy name!

3. Realized I've summoned all the SEO specialists when competing for organic traffic with the seo keyword and am now writing posts teaching you how NOT to do SEO. 😁<br>

The most notable exception to this rule comes in Chapter 9 . In the final part of that chapter, I describe the early evolution of Linux as an offshoot of Minix. It is safe to say that during the first two years of the project's development, the operating system Torvalds and his colleagues were working on bore little similarity to the GNU system envisioned by Stallman, even though it gradually began to share key components, such as the GNU C Compiler and the GNU Debugger.<br>
