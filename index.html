            It's an iPhone 17 rumor frenzy this week courtesy of Jeff Pu, an analyst who has sources within Apple's supply chain in Asia.

<br/>
While the iPhone 16 lineup is still months away from being announced, rumors about the two-generations-away iPhone lineup typically begin to surface about a year-and-a-half before launch. For example, almost exactly a year ago, we learned that the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/">will have larger 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays</a>, respectively.
<br/>

In a research note with investment firm Haitong, Pu said the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will be equipped with 12GB of RAM. For comparison, the &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-models-ha [...]<br>

Pu provided the analysis based on supply chain checks in a new note to investors seen by <em>MacRumors</em>. Foxconn is said to currently be assembling Apple AI servers that contain the ‌M2‌ Ultra, with plans to assemble AI servers powered by the M4 chip in late 2025.

No, no - not at all. How much it cost to make a thing has little to do with what price the thing sells for. And there’s the arbitrage: a business model is all about making the difference between the cost of goods sold and the price paid for goods as big, large, and mysterious as possible.
