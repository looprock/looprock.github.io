The update isn't quite as large as the prior iOS 17.2 update <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-3-beta-features/">in terms of new features</a> so the testing period won't be as long, and we are expecting it to launch before the end of January.

In terms of timing, a launch the week of January 22nd might make the most sense. We've had three betas, two of which have not added anything particularly notable, suggesting there isn't much testing left. If Apple plans to launch the update on the 22nd or the 23rd, we can expect to see the release candidate version of the iOS 17.3 update on the 15th, followed by the la [...]<br>

            The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) today formally opposed Apple's motion for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/apple-watch-removed-from-online-store/">Apple Watch sales ban</a> to remain paused for the duration of Apple's appeal.

In a document filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, ITC lawyers said "Apple presents a weak and unconvincing case to invoke the extraordinary remedy of a stay pending appeal," adding that Apple's arguments "amount to little more than an indisputably adjudicated infringer requesting permission to continue infringing the asserted patents."

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-01-10 10:10:00-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today seeded the third betas of upcoming iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 updates to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the software ahead of its release. The second public iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 betas come almost a month after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/14/apple-seeds-ios-17-3-public-beta-1/">released the first betas</a>. Note that while Apple is calling these the third betas of iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3, there was technically never a second public beta. Apple had to pull the second developer betas of iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3, and opted to go straight to the third beta rather than releasing an updated public beta version.

            <p>As of this writing, I know of three ways to make use of the incremental backup feature that I committed near the end of last month. I'll be interested to see how people deploy in practice. The first idea is to replace some of the full backups you're currently doing with incremental backups, saving backup time and network transfer. The second idea is to do just as many full backups as you do now, but add incremental backups between them, so that if you need to do PITR, you can use <span style="font-family: courier;">pg_combinebackup</span> to reach the latest incremental backup before the point to which you want to recover, reducing the amount of WAL that you need to replay, and probably speeding up the process quite a bit. The third idea is to give up on taking full backups altogether and only ever take incremental backups.</p><span></span><a href="https://rhaas.blogspot.com/2024/01/incremental-backups-evergreen-and-other.html#more">Read more »</a><br>
