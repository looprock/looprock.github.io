            Nothing today announced the launch of the Nothing Phone (2), the second-generation followup to the original Nothing Phone that came out last year. Like the Nothing Phone, the 6.7-inch Nothing Phone (2) features a unique transparent design with LED highlights that Nothing calls a Glyph Interface.

<div class="center-wrap"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>
<br/>
There are additional LED segments in the Glyph for improved customizability, with light and sound sequences able to be assigned to contacts or used for ringtones. The LEDs are also able to function as a progress tracker for ride or delivery services, plus they can alert users to notifications. Design wise, the Phone (2) has a thinner midframe and a pillowed glass back that Nothing says makes it more ergonomic.
