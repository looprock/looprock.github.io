<br/>
In a research note this month, obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>, Long said he expects the iPhone 15 Pro to cost up to $100 more than the iPhone 14 Pro, and the iPhone 15 Pro Max to be $100 to $200 more expensive than the iPhone 14 Pro Max. He believes pricing will remain similar for the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models.

            Flutter Performance Optimization: 6 Hacks for a Faster AppIn this article, the author provides hacks and best practices for optimizing Flutter app performance to avoid jank, stutter, or lag. The first hack is to run the app in profile mode on a real device to identify potential performance issues and measure the impact of optimizations. The second hack is to use the performance overlay and other tools like Flutter DevTools and Dart DevTools to diagnose performance problems. The third hack is to minimize expensive operations, such as layout and rendering, animation, image loading, and intrinsic operations. The fourth hack is to use lazy loading and pagination to reduce data fetching and improve memory usage. The fifth hack is to use tree shaking to remove unused code from the app's binary file and improve startup time. The sixth hack is to use deferred loading to load parts of the code on demand and reduce initial download size and memory usage.

            <p>Exception handling is a critical aspect of software development, and C# provides powerful mechanisms to handle and propagate exceptions.

            <p>A few years ago, I participated as a mentor in a game jam. After the announcement of the winners, one of my mentees asked me:</p>
<p>\</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The winners created their game by assembling assets from the Asset Store. They didn't even write three lines of code. Is that fair?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>\
At that moment, I became convinced that the Unity Asset Store and third-party SDKs (Software Development Kit) are the best things the internet gods have sent us. Imagine a ready-to-use, tested solution that can save your project time and money. What could be better? Only a list of ten solutions that developers will surely be thrilled about.</p>

The order in the list is arbitrary. You won't find in-app purchases or advertisement SDKs here because they deserve a separate article. The same situation is with content assets because their necessity depends on specific projects.</p>

            In this article, the author discusses the growing importance of data in the age of AI and compares data to oil in terms of its value. The rise of AI capabilities has increased the demand for data, leading companies to seek more data to fuel their AI algorithms. The article explores the theory of selling data and its potential dangers, including loss of leverage, financial dependence on companies, surrendering of legal rights, and disruption of market dynamics. Instead of selling data, the author proposes alternative solutions, such as data ownership and control through data vaults and data portability, enhanced privacy measures like government-backed regulations and privacy-enhancing technologies, adopting transparent data practices, and collaborative data approaches like federated learning and data trusts. The goal is to find a safe and responsible way to transfer data to companies for AI development without compromising individual rights and privacy.<br>
