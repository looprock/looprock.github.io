Led by competition policy professor Sean Ennis, the suit alleges Apple's 15-30% commission on App Store sales creates an anti-competitive tax on the UK technology industry.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The foldable smartphone market has stalled with customer interest in foldables waning, but that could change when <a href="https://www.displaysupplychain.com/press-release/foldable-smartphone-market-stalls-in-2024-and-2025">Apple debuts a foldable iPhone</a>, according to display analyst Ross Young.

<br/>
In a report on the current foldable smartphone market, Young says that Apple is expected to "enter the foldable market" in the second half of 2026.
