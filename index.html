            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-03 07:19:33-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Netflix today <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/netflix-moments">announced</a> an update to its Moments feature that lets users save and share favorite scenes as standalone clips, available now in the streaming service's iOS app.

<br/>
The enhanced feature replaces the bookmark-style system and instead allows you to set both the start and end point when saving scenes, giving more precise control over which portions of a scene you want to preserve. Previously, users could only mark a beginning timestamp, which was basically like creating a viewing reminder rather than a shareable segment.

You can access the updated feature by tapping the "Clip" button while watching on mobile devices. The interface now displays drag handle controls over the filmstrip for customizing the clip length, while tapping Save takes [...]<br>

            In iOS 26, currently in beta, Apple Notes has gained new Markdown support, letting you seamlessly import and export files in the popular plain-text formatting language. Whether you're a developer, writer, or content creator, this long-awaited feature should bridge the gap between your existing Markdown workflow and Apple's native note-taking app.

<br/>
For those unfamiliar with Markdown, it's a simple way of writing that uses plain text symbols (like ** for bold or # for headings) to format documents without complicated menus. It's popular because the same text works both as easy-to-read notes and as polished, styled content when exported.
<br/>

In Apple's Notes app, the new functionality works both ways: you can bring existing Markdown files into Notes while preserving formatting like headings, links, and lists,  [...]<br>

The company's latest <a href="https://www.opera.com/browsers/opera/ios">Opera One for iOS</a> update introduces what it calls "the most advanced tab management system" on the platform, in what sounds like a concerted effort to target Safari and Chrome users drowning in dozens of open tabs.

<br/>
Dolby Vision 2 features a more powerful image engine that Dolby says "unlocks even more out of your TV," plus it supports new Content Intelligence tools to optimize TV sets for a "captivating picture" based on the content that's being watched. Specifically, Dolby says that Content Intelligence will gain the following benefits:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>Precision Black reduces consumer frustration that the image is "too dark" by making it crystal clear and improving clarity in any viewing environment without compromising artistic intent.</li>
<br/>
<li>Light Sense fine-tunes picture quality through advanced ambient</li></ul> [...]<br>

            Apple plans to release a lighter weight and more affordable version of the Vision Pro in 2027, according to <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/wagmqku5BLUxzH">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.

<br/>
The upcoming device, which he refers to as the "Vision Air," will supposedly be over 40 percent lighter than the current model. The Vision Pro weighs in at round 1.375 pounds, so a version that's 40 percent lighter should come in at under a pound.
<br/>
<br/>
Kuo also says the Vision Air will be over 50 percent cheaper, which could make it much more attractive to prospective buyers. The Vision Pro costs $3,499, which means a half-priced version would be $1,750. That's still more expensive than an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, but it is closer in price to a higher-end Mac and coul [...]<br>
