<br/>
All aluminum and stainless steel 40mm and 44mm models of the Apple Watch Series 4 are now considered vintage worldwide.

Apple and Apple Authorized Service Providers may offer repairs for vintage devices if parts remain available.

Apple Watch Series 4 models launched in 2018, ushering in a major new design with a thinner case and a 30% larger display than before.

At this point, it is unclear if next-generation CarPlay will ever launch.

            Apple launched almost 30 new hardware products in 2024. Here's a look back at exactly what we got this year. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-787459" height="1176" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-1.00.47-PM.png" width="2160"/>
<br/>
With the exception of Vision Pro, Apple's 2024 hardware releases largely marked a year of steady refinement. It wasn't a year of massive overhauls across the board, but it did feature some key themes. 
<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro, released in February, stands out as Apple's biggest product launch. While its $3,499 price tag keeps it squarely in early-adopter territory, Apple's first spatial computing device provides a hint at where the company expects technology to move over the coming years. Despite both excitement and criticism surrounding its capabilities, it's clear that 2024 was about laying the foundation, with its true impact likely to unfold in the years to come.

As YouTube has grown in popularity over the years, Google has opted to park several features of the video hosting service behind a paywall, such as ad-free viewing, SharePlay on iOS, and the ability to listen to YouTube audio on your iPhone when the app is closed.
