            Apple today added the Thunderbolt Display and the first-generation iPad Air to its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624">obsolete products list</a>, meaning the devices are no longer eligible for repairs or other hardware service at Apple Stores or Apple Authorized Service Providers.

<br/>
Apple classifies a product as obsolete once more than seven years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale. Apple discontinues all hardware service for obsolete products, and service providers cannot order parts for obsolete products. Both the Thunderbolt Display and the original iPad Air were discontinued in 2016.

            Apple is overtly teasing the start of "a new era" and the ability to "code new worlds" at WWDC this year, building anticipation around the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/15/kuo-apple-well-prepared-headset-unveiling/">widely expected</a> announcement of its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ar-vr/">mixed-reality headset</a>.

<br/>
A tweet shared by Apple earlier today made the "new era" remark, seemingly leaning into the high expectations surrounding next week's WWDC keynote. The launch of a major new device and operating system, something that has not occurred since the debut of the original Apple Watch in September 2014, would certainly seem to justify the start of a new era for the company.
