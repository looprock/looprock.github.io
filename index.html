            In an internal memo shared with Apple Authorized Service Providers this week, Apple has acknowledged an issue with installing iPadOS 18 on iPad Pro models with the M4 chip.

The memo, obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>, states that a "small number" of these iPad Pro models are unable to power on after a customer attempted to install iPadOS 18 on the device.

<br/>
Ross Young of Display Supply Chain Consultants today informed <em>MacRumors</em> that the standard iPhone 17 and a slimmer model that we are calling the "iPhone 17 Air" will both feature ProMotion, meaning that each device's display would be able to ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video content when necessary.
<br/>
<br/>
ProMotion would also allow the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air displays to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate. iPhone 13 Pro models can ramp down to 10Hz, while iPhone 14 Pro through iPhone 16 Pro models can go as low as 1Hz, allowing for an always-on display that shows various Lock Screen elements eve [...]<br>

            Apple's latest iPhone 16 models include a new Camera Control button (located on the lower right-hand side when holding the phone in portrait mode).

A simple press of the Camera Control button brings up the Camera app when the iPhone is unlocked. Once the Camera app is open, another press takes a picture, while pressing and holding the button records video for as long as you hold it down.

<p id="bRDipR">Roughly 25 years after it launched payment processing, PayPal is “ushering in a new era for customers” with some generic black text. The company has a new logo, <a href="https://www.pentagram.com/work/paypal/story">designed by Pentagram</a>, that looks incredibly plain — especially compared to previous iterations of the logo that featured a rakish slant, two shades of blue, and prominent PayPal P’s. </p>
