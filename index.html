            Apple today seeded a third beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, the software that is designed to run on the Vision Pro headset. The second beta <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/25/apple-releases-visionos-beta-2/">came out in July</a>, so it has been over a month since Apple released a ‌visionOS‌ update.

A select number of developers have access to Vision Pro headsets at this time, with the headsets used for app testing purposes. Most people will not have access to the ‌visionOS‌ beta outside of Xcode, and it is not yet clear what Apple is adding in each ‌visionOS‌ update.

<br/>
As early as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/15/apple-tsmc-3nm-production-capacity/">May</a>, Apple was known to have booked nearly 90% of the Taiwanese pure-play foundry for its upcoming next-gen devices. However, Apple is now projected to take 100% of TSMC's capacity in 2023, due to delays in Intel's wafer needs owing to later modifications to the company's CPU platform design plans.
<br/>
<br/>
Intel's lack of orders means TSMC's sales of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> chips will be significantly lower this year. While  [...]<br>

            As I look back on ten years of The Information, I am tremendously proud of our journalism and the fact that we’ve built one of the largest (profitable!) subscription businesses in news. I plan to carve out time over the coming months to reread many of the stories we’ve broken and reassess the industry changes that followed. I think it is also a good moment to step back and think about where the industry is headed in the next 10 years. Expect bold predictions.<br>

            Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used for dimensionality reduction in data analysis and machine learning. It aims to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation while retaining as much relevant information as possible. The transformed dimensions, known as principal components, are new axes in the feature space that capture the maximum variance present in the original data.<br>
