For small engineering teams, this balance can feel especially difficult. Limited resources, tight deadlines, and shared responsibilities often mean that reliability improvements are postponed in favor of feature delivery. The good news is that improving reliability does not require heavy frameworks, additional [&#8230;]<br>

            Smart home company <a href="https://www.aqara.com/us/">Aqara</a> today debuted its latest smart lock, the U400. The Aqara Smart Lock U400 incorporates ultra wideband (UWB) technology for more precise location-based tracking and automated door unlocking.

There are few UWB smart locks on the market, but the technology uses the UWB chip in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to unlock the door right as you approach. There is no need to tap an ‌iPhone‌ on the lock with UWB, so the door can be unlocked entirely hands-free. We were able to test the lock ahead of its introduction at CES, and the UWB technology worked as advertised.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iPhone 17e will feature upgrades including a pill-shaped Dynamic Island cutout and a downclocked A19 chip, with mass production set to begin this month, claims a Chinese leaker.

The current iPhone 16e features a "notch" at the top of the display, similar to the ‌iPhone‌ 13 and ‌iPhone‌ 14, and contains Apple's A18 chip with a 4-core GPU, instead of the 5-core GPU version found in the iPhone 16.

            <b>Published:</b> 2026-01-06 03:04:13-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            CES 2026 has just provided a first glimpse of the folding display technology that Apple is expected to use in its upcoming foldable iPhone. At the event, Samsung Display briefly showcased its new crease-less foldable OLED panel beside a Galaxy Z Fold 7, and according to <em><a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-crease-less-foldable-oled-panel-showcased-z-fold-8/">SamMobile</a></em>, which saw the test booth before it was abruptly removed, the new panel "has no crease at all" in comparison.

The existing display used in the Galaxy Z Fold 7 does an impressive job of reducing crease visibility, but crucially it can still be seen at certain viewing angles. In contrast, Samsung Display claims that the newer panel, destined for the Z Fold 8, offers "seamless text across the fold" whichever w [...]<br>

<p>We can all agree that given the option of being worse off or better off tomorrow, the next week, or even in 100 years, that we would like to be better off.</p>
<p>This leads to a link that we need money and growth to fund prosperity in the future. Compound Interest is magic, so whatever you can spare to invest in today in worth it.</p>

            <p>Employees think working from home is fine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hybrid work has moved from novelty to normality, but employers and employees are no longer aligned on what it should look like. More than half of employees (56%) now work in the office full-time, yet only 15% would choose this pattern, with three-quarters (75%) preferring a more balanced approach.</p>
<p>This widening gap signals that organizations face a choice: continue to rely on presence-led models or shift toward purpose-led ones. Presence-led approaches treat attendance as a stand-in for productivity, yet many employees question the value of being on site when work can be completed just as effectively elsewhere. This is reinforced by over 80% of respondents saying that their employer is already well equipped for hybrid working, and by the fact that the main advantages of office time are relationship-driven rather than operational.</p>
