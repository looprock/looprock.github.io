Apple would not tell us which consoles it classifies as retro, but developer Riley Testut's popular emulator Delta is &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/delta-gam [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>When I look at recent platform engineering surveys, the results are positive: people see the value in platforms and platform groups. I’d say this is because platforms are helping speed up the app release cycle by automating a lot of the infrastructure work app developers would otherwise need to do, baking in/automating security and compliance, and, to a lesser extent, standardizing how apps are built, run, managed, and optimized.</p><p>Here’s my notes on one of those surveys, <a href="https://www.puppet.com/success/resources/state-of-platform-engineering?utm_source=cote&amp;utm_campaign=devrel&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_content=newsletter20240416">the one from Perforce/Puppet</a>.

<p id="Sbv6ZD">On the afternoon of March 11th, 2011, Mitsuyoshi Hirai, the chief engineer of the cable maintenance ship Ocean Link,<em> </em>was sitting in his cabin 20 miles off Japan’s eastern coast, completing the paperwork that comes at the end of every repair. Two weeks earlier, something — you rarely knew what — damaged the 13,000-mile fiber optic cable connecting Kitaibaraki, Japan, and Point Arena, California. Alarms went off; calls were made; and the next day, Hirai was sailing out of the port in Yokohama to fix it.</p>
