            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is considering releasing a foldable iPad in the future, according to a paywalled <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/newregister/join.asp?view=snapshots&amp;#s3">preview of an upcoming <em>DigiTimes</em> report</a> shared today.

<br/>
"Apple, who is rumored to have been working on foldable smartphones for several years, reportedly is considering extending the effort to the tablet sector," the preview says, citing sources from the upstream supply chain.
<br/>
<br/>
The report corroborates existing rumors about a foldable iPad.
