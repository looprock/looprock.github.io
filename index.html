In ‌iOS 26‌ beta 2, Apple refined several interface elements to slightly improve visual clarity and usability. The Control Center's Liquid Glass buttons now appear more clearly, thanks to increased background blur that makes them easier to distinguish. Similarly, the Reduce Transparency setting in Accessibility has been enhanced, further cutting down the see-through effect across the UI.

In a post on Chinese social media platform Weibo today, the account Digital Chat Station <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PytwmsmJW">claimed</a> that the lowest-end iPhone 17 model will be equipped with a 6.3-inch display, up from a 6.1-inch display on the equivalent iPhone 16 model.
<br/>

Digital Chat Station has more than three million followers on Weibo, and the account has accurately leaked Apple information in the past.

Last month, Counterpoint Research VP Ross Young also said that the iPhone 17 base model will be equipped with a 6.3-inch display.

            Apple's Swift programming language is now being officially extended to support Android app development through the establishment of a <a href="https://www.swift.org/android-workgroup/">dedicated Android Working Group</a> within the Swift open-source project.

Originally introduced by Apple in 2014 as a modern programming language for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS, Swift has since expanded to include official support for Linux and Windows.
