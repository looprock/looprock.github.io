            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Phone brand Nothing today <a href="https://us.nothing.tech/pages/nothing-chats">announced</a> plans to introduce a new "Nothing Chats" app that features iMessage compatibility later this month.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The app is powered by Sunbird, an unofficial iMessage client that debuted last year with over 10,000 downloads on the Google Play Store. To use the Nothing Chats app with iMessage, users will need to log in with their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a>. The app touts end-to-end encryption in line with Sunbird's privacy policy.
<br/>
<br/>
In a new video, Nothing CEO Carl Pei explained that the app will support individual and group chats, typing indicators, full-size media sharing, and voice notes. Features like read receipts, message reactions, and replies will be added later.

            <p>Sometimes a shiny new feature brings more harm than good. The reason is simple — application size. Any addition to the application — be it code for a new feature, an image resource for a new button or even support for a new localization — contributes to the increase of the application’s size.</p>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-11-14 05:23:33-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Next year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> could feature a more power-efficient display thanks to a new OLED material set that is reportedly being developed by Samsung specifically for Apple.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913689" height="1986" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-Feature.jpg" width="3532"/>
<br/>
A material set includes a variety of components for OLED screens, such as capping layers (CPL), which adjust the optical characteristics of the screen. Each component is produced by a specialist manufacturer and supplied to Samsung, which then uses them to construct the final OLED panel. 
<br/>
<br/>
A different composition of materials in the set can alter attributes of the OLED panel, such as lifespan, brightness, color accuracy, or manufacturing efficiency.
