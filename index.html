            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            At the annual SXSW film festival in Austin, Texas today, Apple's services chief Eddy Cue joined Ben Stiller on stage to discuss the hit Apple TV+ show <a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/originals/severance/">Severance</a>.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Cue is a longtime Apple executive who oversees Apple TV+, and the company's other services, while Stiller serves as the director and an executive producer of Severance. In a session that ran for more than 40 minutes, the two discussed the critically-acclaimed series, with a few jokes about Apple and other comments mixed in.
<br/>
<br/>
Severance revolves around the mysterious company Lumon Industries. The company's employees cannot recall any memories about their personal lives while they are at work, and they cannot remember anything about the workplace when they leave the office. The show's second season [...]<br>

<br/>
Here are three reasons why Apple might never release an M4 Ultra chip.
<br/>
<br/>
First, among Apple's line of Mac chips, the highest-end Ultra chips are effectively two Max chips fused together with a technology called UltraFusion. So, the M1 Ultra chip is two M1 Max chips combined, and the M2 Ultra chip is two M2 Max chips combined. However, Apple confirmed that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-confirms-m4-max-lacks-ultrafusion/">M4 Max chip lacks an UltraFusion connector</a>, so that means Apple cannot simply release a doubled-up M4 Ultra chip this tim [...]<br>

The store features Apple's latest retail design, with lots of wood paneling.
