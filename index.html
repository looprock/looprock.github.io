<br/>
In his <em>Power On</em> newsletter today, Gurman said the doorbell would wirelessly connect to a compatible deadbolt lock, allowing users to automatically unlock a door with Face ID. The doorbell would likely work with third-party HomeKit locks, but Apple could also partner with another brand to offer an all-in-one solution, he said.

<br/>
Apple's doorbell would compete with Amazon's line of Ring doorbells, but Gurman did not say if Apple's solution would capture video.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple appears to be internally testing iOS 18.2.1 for the iPhone, based on evidence of the software update in our website's analytic logs this week. The logs have accurately revealed many iOS versions before they were released.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954594" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
iOS 18.2.1 should be a minor update that fixes bugs and/or addresses security vulnerabilities, but it is unclear which specific issues might be resolved. The update will likely be released in late December or early January.
<br/>
<br/>
There could be accompanying updates, such as macOS 15.2.1, but we have not confirmed that.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.2.1 will follow iOS 18.2, which was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/apple-releases-ios-18-2-update/">released earlier this month</a>. iOS 18.2 introduced more Apple Intelligence features for iPhone 15 Pro models and all iPhone 1 [...]<br>

It is unclear how much the screen-equipped HomePod would cost, but Apple is seemingly aiming for a reasonable price. In a paywalled report this week, the supply chain publication said Apple has selected China-based manufacturer Tianma to supply the LCD panels for the device, at an "exceptionally competitive" price of $10 per panel. The low cost of this component would likely contribute to the device being more affordable.

            Starting today, the third-generation iPhone SE, iPhone 14, and iPhone 14 Plus, are listed as unavailable on Apple's online store in Switzerland, ahead of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/04/eu-passes-law-to-switch-iphone-to-usb-c-in-2024/">regulation</a> that will require smartphones with wired charging capabilities that are newly placed for sale to be equipped with a USB-C port in the European Union (EU).

<br/>
Switzerland is not officially part of the EU, but the country participates in the single EU market and is thereby subject to EU trading laws.
<br/>
<br/>
While all iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 models are equipped with USB-C ports for wired charging, the iPhone SE, iPhone 14, and iPhone 14 Plus still have Lightning ports, so Apple appears to be responding to the upcoming regulation. The law applies to any i [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            OpenAI has expanded the capabilities of its ChatGPT app for macOS, adding support for Apple Notes and a range of popular third-party apps. The update builds on last month's release that introduced the ability to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/14/openai-chatgpt-xcode-for-mac/">read on-screen content from select Mac apps</a>.

            Apple launched the controversial "trashcan" <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> eleven years ago today, introducing one of its most criticized designs that persisted through a period of widespread discontentment with the Mac lineup.

<br/>
The redesign took the ‌Mac Pro‌ in an entirely new direction, spearheaded by a polished aluminum cylindrical design that became unofficially dubbed the "trashcan" in the Mac community. All of the ‌Mac Pro‌'s components were mounted around a central thermal dissipation core, cooled by a single fan that pulled air from under the case, through the core, and out the top. The fan could spin more slowly than smaller fans and keep the Mac extremely quiet, even during intense operations.
