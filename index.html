We first learned of Apple's low-cost MacBook plans in late June, when analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the company was developing a "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-to-launch-low-cost-macbook/">more affordable</a>" 13-inch laptop (the analyst did not mention a price) that would with compete with Chromebooks and drive MacBook purchases. 
<br/>
<br/>
Kuo said the new MacBook is set to use an A18 Pro chip, which debuted in the iPhone 16 Pro last year. That would make it the first Mac powered by an iPhone chip. So far, all Apple silicon Macs have used M-series chips, which feature more cores, greater memory capacity, and improved external [...]<br>

Apple also continues to test the new Siri with its own apps, he said. Apple's own example was an iPhone user asking Siri about their mother's flight and lunch reservation plans based on info retrieved from the Mail and Messages apps.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            It was long rumored that Apple would release the first MacBook Pro models with OLED displays next year, but that timeframe is a little less certain now.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 26 introduces a new Liquid Glass design, but the update also includes some other new features that have not received as much attention.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005033" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/iOS-26-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Below, we recap three smaller iOS 26 features that you might have missed.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26 should be released in September, but anyone can <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/install-ios-26-public-beta-on-your-iphone/">sign up to test the public beta for free</a>. Make sure to back up your iPhone first.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-09 17:33:53-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iPhone 17 models will "likely" be more expensive than iPhone 16 models in the U.S., according to Jeff Pu, an analyst at investment firm GF Securities.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-998158" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/iPhone-17-Pro-on-Desk-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
In a research note this week, Pu attributed the potential iPhone 17 price increases to the U.S. imposing tariffs on products imported from countries where the iPhone is assembled, including China and India. Apple is currently paying a 20% tariff on iPhones imported from China, but none on iPhones imported from India, according <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-iphones-india-trump-tariffs-789c7209">to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>. However, the Trump administration's tariff policies frequently change.

Apple is likely planning to introduce an updated S11 chip that offers a more compact, efficient design. We could see improvements in processor performance to increase overall battery life, along with additional space for a bigger battery or other internal components.
