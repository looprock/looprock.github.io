            <b>Published:</b> 2024-01-29 08:12:23-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            For the past few weeks, some iPhone users have been unable to view the latest app reviews left by customers in the App Store. Specifically, affected users are only able to read reviews submitted up until January 16 this year.
<br/>

<br/>
It's unclear how widespread this issue is, but it seems to be very inconsistent, with recent reviews showing for some users and not for others depending on the app. We were able to reproduce the issue on iPhones in the U.S. and Canada, but not on an iPhone the U.K., while the Mac App Store does not appear to be affected whatsoever.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-01-29 03:21:59-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple-owned Shazam has released an updated version of the app with a new feature that can identify songs from other apps while you're listening using headphones.  
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-857861" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/08/shazam-for-mac.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
Shazam has been able to recognize songs from other apps for some time, but if headphones were connected to your iPhone, the feature wouldn't work, until now. The latest version of the app, v17.3, fixes that limitation.
<br/>
<br/>
The feature works when wired or bluetooth headphones are connected, and they don't have to be Apple-made accessories, so third-party headphones are also supported.
<br/>
<br/>
To use the feature, open the Shazam app, check for the headphone icon to confirm your headphones are connected, and then you'll be able to start recognizing music around you or within apps like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Browser Company has released a new iPhone app called <a href="https://arc.net/blog/arc-search">Arc Search</a> that aims to reimagine the online search experience by using artificial experience to present web results in a more easily digestible, curated presentation.

<br/>
The app follows the company's <a href="https://arc.net">Arc Browser</a> for Mac, and could be described as an AI chat bot with web access (think <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai">perplexity.ai</a>), wrapped in a clean, minimalist browser interface that quickly builds webpages on the fly based on your search query.
<br/>
<br/>
The app opens with a search bar and keyboard, and its main AI-powered feature, "Browse for me," reads at least six websites and returns key information about the search query in a neatly presented webpage.

Apple's rate now exceeds that of popular HYSAs offered by the likes of American Express, Capital One, and Discover, but there are a handful of other options that offer even higher APYs in the 4.6% to low 5% range, such as Synchrony Bank and Wealthfront.

            This week we’re going deep on security and what it takes to shift left, seriously. Adam is joined by Justin Garrison (co-host of Ship It), plus two members of the BoxyHQ team — Deepak Prabhakara, Co-founder & CEO and Schalk Neethling, Community Manager and DevRel as well as fellow Changelog Slack member. We discuss how to shift left, the role of the developer and the burden of security, the importance of tooling, the difference between authentication and authorization, and a mindset change for when security takes place — it’s a matter of “when” not “who.”<br>
