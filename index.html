<br/>
The Weibo user known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/">Digital Chat Station</a>" claims that Apple is testing a new main camera for the ‌iPhone‌ with a variable aperture. A variable aperture allows the camera to adjust the amount of light that reaches the sensor. This means that in dark environments, the aperture can be opened to receive more light, while in light environments, it can be closed to prevent over-exposure. It also should provide users with greater control over depth of field, which refers to how sharp a subject appears in the foreground compared to the background.

"Watch how the new front facing camera on iPhone 17 Pro takes group selfies that automatically expand and rotate as more people come into frame," says Apple. While the ad is focused on the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max, the regular iPhone 17 and the iPhone Air have the same Center Stage front camera with this functionality.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple provided more details in its iPhone 17 press releases last year:<blockquote>Users no longer have to rotate their iPhone to take a landscape selfie — they can now take photos and videos in portrait or landscape while holding their iPhone vertically, enabling a more comfortable, secure grip and centred gaze. For group shots, Center Stage for photos uses AI to automatically expand the field of view and can rota</blockquote> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In the iOS 26.4 update that's coming this spring, Apple will introduce a new version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> that's going to overhaul how we interact with the personal assistant and what it's able to do.

<br/>
The iOS 26.4 version of ‌Siri‌ won't work like ChatGPT or Claude, but it will rely on large language models (LLMs) and has been updated from the ground up.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="llm_siri">Upgraded Architecture</h2>
<br/>
The next-generation version of ‌Siri‌ will use advanced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/21/apple-llm-siri-2026/">large language models</a>, similar to those used by ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. Apple isn't implementing full chatbot interactions, but <em>any</em> upgrade is both better than what's available now and long overdue.
