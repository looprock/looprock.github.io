            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In macOS Sonoma 14.2, Apple included some additional controls for Shazam music recognition, which is now baked into the Mac operating system more than ever. Here's how to add the functionality to your Mac's menu bar and Control Center.

<br/>
For those unfamiliar with Shazam, it's an Apple-owned popular service that can identify the names and lyrics of songs, music videos, TV shows, and more, simply by listening to and deciphering whatever is playing. 
<br/>
<br/>
After years of ‌‌Siri‌‌ integration, Apple acquired Shazam in 2018, and integrated it into iOS and iPadOS as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-shazam-without-downloading-app/">system-level song recognition function</a>. With macOS 14.2, the same level of integration has finally come to Mac.

The rumor comes from Weibo user "<a href="https://weibo.com/u/5143897135">Instant Digital</a>" and suggests that 2024's ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ models will be the first to feature more than one 48-megapixel sensor, leaving the Telephoto camera as the only rear-facing lens with a 12-megapixel resolution. The Ultra Wide camera's upgrade to a 48-megapixel sensor should allow it to capture more light, resulting in enhanced photos when shooting in 0.5× mode, especially in low-light environments.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=6e9odqgu">announced</a> an App Store pilot program called "contingent pricing" that lets app developers offer discounts to customers with multiple subscriptions.

<br/>
Developers can offer contingent pricing to customers who already have subscriptions "from one developer or two different developers." For example, a developer could attract customers to a subscription by offering discounted pricing if they have an active subscription with another developer.
<br/>
<blockquote>Contingent pricing for subscriptions on the App Store — a new feature that helps you attract and retain subscribers — lets you give customers a discounted subscription price as long as they're actively subscribed to a different subscription.</blockquote>As noted by <em>&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/1</em> [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iOS 17.2, iPadOS 17.2, and tvOS 17.2, Apple removed the option to purchase TV shows and movies from the iTunes Store apps, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/ios-17-2-itunes-store-tv-movie-removed/">redirecting customers</a> to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app instead. Unfortunately, Apple's move to consolidate purchasing and viewing in the ‌Apple TV‌ app has done away with wishlists, and customers who used the feature got no warning about their elimination.

            Apple made few updates to the Apple Watch lineup in 2023, but the 2024 Apple Watch models are expected to include a new feature set that will make them much more appealing to consumers, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-17/apple-2024-plans-new-low-end-airpods-vision-pro-larger-iphone-16-oled-ipad-lq9jhed4">said today in his Power On newsletter</a>.
