            Apple has been refining Liquid Glass during the developer beta testing process, and both beta two and beta three have introduced some major tweaks. There was little outcry over the updates that Apple made in the second beta, but the third beta's design updates have frustrated some users who feel that Apple is removing too much of the Liquid Glass aesthetic.

For context, Apple made navigation bars more opaque across many apps in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> beta 3, and we've got a series of side-by-side comparisons that demonstrate what's different.

            Apple appears to be developing an AI-based "Support Assistant" for the Apple Support app. Signs of the feature were found in Apple code by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris, but the Support Assistant doesn't appear to be live in the app as of yet.

<br/>
Apple users will interact with Support Assistant through chats. The Apple Support app already has a chat feature that relies on Messages, but it is used for communicating with Apple's live support agents. Support Assistant would likely allow customers to open the Apple Support app, type in a problem that they're having, and get generative AI-based solutions as a step before contacting a live person. Apple's code says that users will have the option to consult with an Apple advisor for help after using the Support Assistant feature.

It just helps to make the interaction a bit more polite and friendly, which usually makes people more willing to help you out.”</p><p>Of course, I immediately wanted to ask the logical follow up question, “yes, but <em>why</em> does it show respect and appreciation” which is the crux of the question, and then another: and why is that ‘nice’? This the important thing: saying the effect of something - saying “please” - doesn’t tell you the why and how of something.
