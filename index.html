            <p>"We can’t hire the right people” is the eternal complaint of CIOs everywhere. They’re beset by all this FUD’ing out about Facebook coming and disrupting the toothpaste industry, Google accidentally dis-intermediating car insurance, Elon Musk launching a bank<a class="footnote-anchor" href="https://cote.io/feed.xml#footnote-1" id="footnote-anchor-1" target="_self">1</a>, or Amazon doing anything new. </p><p>I call this freaking out the “macro-economic headwinds” part of any pitch, freakout, or “TED-style” talk. The CIO’s reply is often: if only they could just hire the right people to sling the code, install Kubernetes the hard way, write good ChatGPT prompts, or whatever, they could turn those headwinds into tailwinds.</p><p>We’re trying our best, the executives clamor. But, the skills! Our people just don’t have the skills!
