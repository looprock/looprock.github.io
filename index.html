            If you've been interrupted by your iPhone's Wallet app with unwanted promotional alerts, here's some good news: In iOS 26, currently in beta, Apple has listened to complaints and added a simple toggle to silence these marketing messages for good.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-26 23:21:40-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iOS 26 (currently in beta), Apple has finally caught up with rival podcast apps like Overcast by adding more fine-grained playback speed controls to the Podcasts app.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1015704" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/iOS-26-Podcasts-Glass-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
While competitors have long offered precise speed adjustments, Apple's rigid presets often left you caught between speeds that felt either too slow or uncomfortably fast.
<br/>
<br/>
In previous versions of iOS, Apple's stock Podcasts app provided only four fixed playback speed options: 1.25x, 1.5x, 1.75, and 2x. That's changed in iOS 26, and users now have a lot more flexibility.
<br/>
<br/>
Not only has Apple increased the range of playback speeds from 0.5x to 3x, the updated setting also allows you to adjust the speed in 0.1x increments, thanks to a new, more granular adjustment interface.

<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>

Apple will stream the "Awe Dropping" event on YouTube, on its <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">Apple Events website</a>, and in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app, so there are multiple ways to watch it.
<br/>
<br/>
YouTube users can click on the video placeholder and select the "Notify me" option to get a notification when the livestream is up. There's also an included countdown.
<br/>
<br/>
If YouTube has your location information, the notification and countdown will be displayed in local time, which makes it a good way to double check when you will need to tune in to watch the event. Apple's events are almost always at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time, which is 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time, evening in Europe, and early morning in countries in Asia and Australia [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iOS 26 update, currently in beta, brings a nice optional upgrade to screen capture quality with HDR (High Dynamic Range) capture support. The new feature captures or video-records what's on your iPhone's screen while preserving rich colors and detail. 
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
HDR screenshots are particularly valuable when capturing content with high contrast – like bright app interfaces against dark backgrounds, HDR videos, or detailed photos. The enhanced dynamic range preserves details that would typically be lost in standard screenshots, making them ideal for sharing visual content or documenting app interfaces with greater fidelity.
