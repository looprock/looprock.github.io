            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-24 08:20:02-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In the iOS 26 beta, Apple has redesigned the alarm screen in the Clock app, giving it a cleaner look with a larger time display and significantly bigger buttons. When the alarm goes off, you'll now see two large, equal-sized buttons for Stop and Snooze placed side by side at the bottom of the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1007849" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/iOS-18-vs-26-Alarms.jpg" width="2500"/><div class="center-wrap"><em>Alarm screen in iOS 18 (left) versus iOS 26 beta 2</em></div>
<br/>
While the redesign fits with Apple's broader visual refresh in iOS 26, it also seems to address a problem the company had already solved: reducing the chances of you hitting Stop instead of Snooze when you're half-awake and fumbling for your phone. Ironically, internal testing once showed that making both buttons the same size actually made that mistake more likely.

The ‌iPhone‌ 4 first became available to customers on June 24, 2010, following its unveiling by then-CEO Steve Jobs at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference earlier that month. It was the first ‌iPhone‌ to feature a high-resolution "Retina" display, with a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch, making individual pixels imperceptible at a standard viewing distance. Apple described it at the time as offering "four times the pixel density of previous displays," resulting in crisper text and sharper images.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is considering LG Innotek's chip-on-film (CoF) technology for future iPad Pro OLED displays, a change that could potentially deliver slimmer bezels and more compact designs without sacrificing screen size.

Korean outlet <em><a href="https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=5326">The Elec</a></em> reports that Apple is expected to approve or reject LX Semicon's display driver IC this month, which would work alongside LG Innotek's CoF technology. CoF technology attaches display driver chips to panels using heat compression on flexible film, sending signals to control individual pixels through thin-film transistors.

<br/>
The combination enables tighter integration of the panel along the display's edges, which could end up shrinking the visible bezels and creating more scree [...]<br>

Following years of rumors, Apple in June 2020 unveiled its plan to transition the entire Mac lineup from Intel processors to its own custom-designed chips.

Later that year saw the release of the first three Mac models powered by Apple silicon, including a 13-inch MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and Mac mini.

Apple had plenty of experience after a decade of making custom iPhone and iPad chips, and it was time for the Mac to switch from x86 to Arm architecture.

            In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> beta 2, Apple updated the location of the new tab icon in Safari, fixing a frustrating change that was made in the first ‌iOS 26‌ beta.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In macOS Tahoe Beta 2, Apple included a new option to add a background to the menu bar, making it possible to have a menu bar design that’s similar to the menu bar in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>.

<br/>
As part of macOS Tahoe’s Liquid Glass design, Apple removed the background of the menu bar, so it blends into the wallpaper or background behind it. The icons of the menu bar are more free floating with the transparent look, though Apple does add a slight gradient to wallpapers to improve visibility.
<br/>
<br/>
The menu bar toggle is available in the System Settings app under the Menu Bar section. Turning it on clearly delineates the background from the menu bar for those that prefer the non-transparent aesthetic.

            In the initial macOS Tahoe beta, Apple swapped the colors of the Finder icon, a longtime Mac classic. Rather than featuring blue on the left side of the face and light blue on the right side, the icon was primarily white and the right side of the face was blue.

The updated Finder look was a significant deviation from the design that Apple has used for Finder since 1996, and many Mac users were <a href="https://512pixels.net/2025/06/wwdc25-macos-tahoe-breaks-decades-of-finder-history/">unhappy with the change</a>.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-23 11:29:14-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 26 adds a new Recovery Assistant feature to all compatible iPhones, and it can help return the device to a working state, with no Mac or PC required.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1007742" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/iOS-26-Recovery-Assistant-Feature-Clean.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Recovery Assistant was introduced in the first iOS 26 beta, but Apple only mentioned the feature in its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26-release-notes">release notes</a> for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/23/apple-seeds-ios-26-beta-2/">second iOS 26 beta</a> today.
<br/>
<br/>
"Recovery Assistant is a new way to recover your device if it doesn't start up normally," says Apple. "It can look for problems and attempt to resolve them if found."
<br/>
<br/>
Apple says an iPhone running iOS 26 will boot into a Recovery mode if the device has "encountered an issue while starting."

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-23 11:07:14-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The second beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> includes a new ringtone that's an alternative to the classic "Reflection" ringtone that Apple uses as a default on iPhones. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006157" height="592" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/ios-26-call-holding.jpg" width="1052"/>
<br/>
Apple didn't give the new ringtone a special name, and it's just listed as "Alt 1" as an option if you tap into Reflection. You can get to the ringtone in ‌iOS 26‌ by opening up Sounds and Haptics in the Settings app, tapping on Ringtone, and then tapping on Reflection.
<br/>
<br/>
The classic Reflection ringtone is still the default, so if you prefer the new sound, you'll need to set it manually. You can listen to the ringtone below.

<br/>
The Control Center buttons are now slightly more opaque, making it easier to see the different control options even on a multicolored background. The new, more opaque look is apparent with the standard app icons and the glass icon style. 
<br/>
<br/>
The Liquid Glass design refresh in ‌iOS 26‌ will be an adjustment, but small tweaks like the one Apple made to Control Center will make it easier for people to transition when the operating system launches this fall. <div class="linkback">Rela</div> [...]<br>
