            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Global memory scarcity will cause a 13 percent drop in smartphone sales in 2026, according to IDC (via <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-26/idc-sees-13-collapse-in-smartphone-market-due-to-memory-crisis">Bloomberg</a></em>). DRAM is in short supply because AI companies are buying huge quantities of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for servers in data centers, and manufacturers are prioritizing HBM instead of the memory used in consumer devices.

<br/>
IDC says that the global memory supply has been drained into next year, putting smartphone makers in a tough spot. Prices have spiked because there's not enough memory to meet production needs, which will cause a smartphone market "crisis like no other."

Smartphone makers are expected to ship 1.1 billion devices in 2026, down from 1.26 billion in 20 [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2026-02-26 10:26:14-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            After several weeks of testing, Apple today released Xcode 26.3, an update that allows developers to use tools like Anthropic's Claude Agent and OpenAI's Codex for app creation directly in Xcode.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1035002" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/macOS-26-Xcode.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
With support for agentic coding, Xcode can complete more complex app development tasks autonomously. Apple worked with Anthropic and OpenAI to configure their agents for use in Xcode and to ensure that AI models can access a full range of Xcode features.
<br/>
<br/>
Agents are able to create new files, examine code structure of a project, build a project directly and run tests, take image snapshots to check their work, and access Apple's full, up-to-date developer documentation.
<br/>
<br/>
Along with OpenAI and Anthropic models, Xcode 26.3 is compatible with any agent or tool that uses the open standard Model Context Protocol.
