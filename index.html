            <b>Published:</b> 2024-05-13 09:44:03-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            An alleged <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/6062510">Geekbench 6 benchmark result</a> for the lower-end version of the M4 chip with a 9-core CPU surfaced over the weekend, providing a first look at how it performs compared to the higher-end M4 chip with a 10-core CPU.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949127" height="1350" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/M4-iPad-Pro-Thumb-3.jpg" width="2400"/>
<br/>
The result indicates that the 9-core M4 chip is around 10% slower than the 10-core variant in terms of multi-core performance. While that outcome might seem obvious at first glance, the 9-core variant of the chip has three performance cores, instead of four in the 10-core variant, so this result was not guaranteed.
<br/>
<br/>
Assuming that the Geekbench 6 listing is accurate, the 9-core M4 chip is still around 13% faster than the M3 chip for multi-core performance, and up to 35% faster than the M2 chip in the previous-generation iPad Pro.

            AppleCare+ has long offered iPhone screen repairs for $29 in the U.S., and this option is <a href="https://support.apple.com/ipad/repair">now available for the new iPad Pro and iPad Air models</a> too.

Apple says the $29 screen repair option is limited to the 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro models with the M4 chip, and the 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Air models with the M2 chip, and the devices must have no other damage in order to qualify.

Content made using TikTok's AI creation tools has included an AI label for more than a year, but going forward, TikTok will also label AI images made through other platforms. TikTok's tool will read Content Credentials, a technology from the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA). Content Credentials are designed to attach metadata to AI content, facilitating AI labeling.

            Apple's shift to develop its own AI technology to keep up with competitors was today detailed in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/business/apple-siri-ai-chatgpt.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> report.
