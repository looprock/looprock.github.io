            Earlier this week, Apple made the decision to delay the release of upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+ series "The Savant" due to its topic and the current political climate.

In iOS 18, Apple introduced Tinted app icons. The option applies a color filter over app icons, widgets, and even system UI elements. And with iOS 26, Apple has built on the theme with a new option that matches the color of your iPhone's removable case.

            Logitech has announced the <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/signature-slim-solar-plus">Signature Slim Solar+ K980</a>, a full-size wireless keyboard that relies entirely on solar power. The device features a solar panel along its top edge and doesn't even have a USB charging connector, so if you dislike cable clutter, this could be your kind of thing.

The K980 uses Logitech's LightCharge technology, which needs a minimum of 200 lux of ambient light to maintain power, which can come from sunlight or artificial light sources. When fully charged, the keyboard can operate in complete darkness for up to four months, claims the company.

            In iOS 26, seamless multilingual conversations in Messages are just a few taps away, thanks to Apple's new Live Translation feature.

<br/>
<br/>
Tranlsation works with nine languages including Chinese (Mandarin, Simplified), French, German, Italian, English, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish (Spain).

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple may be working on new functionality that would expand what third-party smartwatches are able to do when connected to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. As noted by <em><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2917201/ios-26-1-beta-suggests-the-iphone-will-soon-support-third-party-smartwatches.html">Macworld</a></em>, iOS 26.1 code mentions a Notification Forwarding feature that could be designed for third-party watches.

The ‌Apple Watch SE 3‌ supports Always-On display technology, which the SE 2 lacked. You can now glance at the time and see complications without having to wake the watch, which is much more useful. The standard Apple Watch models have had Always-On displays since the Series 5, so it's long overdue for the SE. The Ion-X glass that protects the display is more durable than before, and it is 4x more resistant to cracking.
