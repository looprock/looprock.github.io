We take a closer look at the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/iphone-17-air-thin-as-buttons/">rumored design</a> of the ‌iPhone 17‌ "Air," which is expected to introduce a radically thinner design. It is rumored to be as thin as 5.5mm, versus the 8.725mm thickness of the Pro models. It has now emerged that even the buttons will need to be thinner than those used on the other models to simply fit on the device.

In 2020, Google added a function to its Chrome browser called Scroll to Text Fragment (STTF) that helps you achieve this. It allows URLs to link directly to any visible text on a page. You may have seen it work in Google Search, where clicking on a link in your returned results takes you to a highlighted passage of text further down the page.
<br/>
<br/>
Since then, Google has built the feature into the open source Chromium code, so most other popular Chromium browsers like Edge, Opera, and Vivaldi also have it these days. (Brave is an exception, citing &lt;a href="https://github.com/WICG/scroll-to-text-fragment/issues/76 [...]<br>

            <p>Not only can you give more direction to the AI when you&rsquo;re playing solo D&amp;D with it, you can start to understand how it thinks. I walk through how to use MCP Server tools to enhance solo roleplaying with Claude (and ChatGPT, etc.) and how to get extra information about how the AI is thinking. Also, I show you how to do logging despite the weird setup Claude Desktop requires.</p>
<p>More generally, you get to see why doing more documentation is important for agentic tools like Model Context Protocol. You have to shift from thinking like a programmer making APIs to thinking like a prompt engineer having a conversation with the AI.</p>

The ambitious timeline would require Apple to double its current iPhone production capacity in India. It marks a major acceleration of Apple's supply chain diversification strategy, which has been gradually expanding in recent years.

            Apple is removing another project from AI chief John Giannandrea, and he will no longer oversee Apple's secret robotics division, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-24/apple-to-strip-secret-robotics-unit-from-ai-chief-weeks-after-moving-siri">Bloomberg</a></em>.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-04-24 12:54:27-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With the launch of iOS 18.4, Apple introduced a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> feature that summarizes multiple user reviews to provide an at-a-glance summary of what people think of an app or a game. In a new blog post on its <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/app-store-review">Machine Learning Research blog</a>, Apple provides some detail on how ‌App Store‌ review summaries work.

<br/>
Apple is using a multi-step large language model (LLM) system to generate the summaries, with the aim of creating overviews that are inclusive, balanced, and accurately reflect the user's voice. Apple says that it prioritizes "safety, fairness, truthfulness, and helpfulness" in its summaries, while outlining some of the challenges in aggregating ‌App Store‌ review [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When an iPad running iPadOS 19 is connected to a Magic Keyboard, a macOS-like menu bar will appear on the screen, <a href="https://majinbuofficial.com/ipados-19-and-ios-19-new-features/">according to the leaker Majin Bu</a>.

<br/>
This change would further blur the lines between the iPad and the Mac. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman previously claimed that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/13/ipados-19-more-like-macos/">iPadOS 19 will be "more like macOS,"</a> with unspecified improvements to productivity, multitasking, and app window management, and the addition of a macOS-like menu bar would certainly align with that overall plan.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdR32VJQ6aE">shared a new ad</a> that highlights a key advantage that iPhone 16 models have over Android smartphones: the Ceramic Shield.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Apple says the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max displays are all protected by the latest-generation Ceramic Shield material, which is advertised as being "2x tougher than glass on any other smartphone."
<br/>
<br/>
In the new "Trust Issues" ad, a father hands his iPhone to a stranger and asks them to take a photo of his family at a carnival. Unfortunately, the stranger drops the iPhone, leading to a moment of suspense given the device might have been damaged. However, the display glass remains intact due to the Ceramic Shield.
<br/>
<br/>
"Relax, it's iPhone 16," the video description concludes.

<br/>
Of course, your mileage may vary.

            While the so-called "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>" is not expected to launch until September, there are already plenty of rumors about the ultra-thin device.

<br/>
Overall, the iPhone 17 Air sounds like a mixed bag. While the device is expected to have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/22/iphone-17-air-thinness-video/">impressively thin and light design</a>, rumors indicate it will have some compromises compared to iPhone 17 Pro models, including only a single rear camera, a single speaker, and an A19 chip instead of a more powerful A19 Pro chip.

In a <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/luXVWtplQ9Bokb">blog post</a> today, the well-known Apple supply chain analyst said that the iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will all be equipped with 12GB of RAM. He previously only expected the iPhone 17 Pro Max to have 12GB of RAM, so this is good news for customers who will be purchasing the other models.
<br/>
<br/>
Kuo said even the base-model iPhone 17 might be equipped with 12GB of RAM, but only if supply chain shortages can be overcome. He said that Apple will make a final decision on the amount of RAM it will offer in this device by May.

In addition, the company is adding an ability to, in real-time, monitor continuous integration processes running in memory. That capability makes it possible to thwart, for example, recent attacks that exploited [&#8230;]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>D&amp;D battle maps are one of the funnest parts of D&amp;D. Just <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/illuminatedcodex/search/battlemaps">looking at them is fun, finding them can be a tiny thrill, and making them is a delightful way to spend hours of time</a>. Oh, and using them. I’ve used Midjourney to make D&amp;D battle maps in the past, <a href="https://cote.io/2024/04/03/creating-huge-dd.html">especially to make really large battle maps</a>. That works great! ChatGPT was never that good at it, until now.</p>
<p>Recently, while playing through <em>Sons of Gruumsh</em>, I asked it to make a few maps, and ChatGPT did great. What was especially surprising was that I hadn’t really described what I wanted the map to look like, I just had the adventure text and some brief description of the areas.</p>
<p>First, it made this regional map:</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Playing D&amp;D with ChatGPT, Claude, or whatever is fun. But sometime you want more control over how it behaves and what it does. Check out this video for a quick tutorial on creating an oracle plugin for Claude. This &ldquo;plugin&rdquo; is a Model Context Protocol Server written in Java using Spring AI. Once you create the MCP Server, you can hook the oracle into Claude which will use it while you play as a simple yes/no oracle. This is a simple example that will show you how to get everything setup with Java and Spring AI to start making MCP Server tools. Keep an eye out for the rest in the series where I&rsquo;ll make much more complex and fun tools.</p>
