<br/>
Sure, at $399 it's pricey, and this ultraportable unit from B&amp;O is unashamedly pitched at the premium end of the Bluetooth speaker market, but the Danish high-end audio manufacturer's principled attention to design and craftsmanship almost justifies the price alone. Fortunately, it sounds great, too.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is preparing to release iOS 18.7 for compatible iPhone models, according to evidence of the update in the <em>MacRumors</em> visitor logs.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984198" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/iOS-18-on-iPhone-Arrow-Down.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
We expect iOS 18.7 to be released in September, alongside iOS 26. The update will likely include fixes for security vulnerabilities, but little else.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.7 will be one of the final updates ever released for the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR, as those devices are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/ios-26-supports-iphone-11-and-newer/">not compatible with iOS 26</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26 is compatible with the iPhone 11 and newer.
<br/>
<br/>
Following months of beta testing, iOS 26 is finally nearing a release, with the update likely to be made available to the general public around the middle of September.
