            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If you're a Mac user with a Windows PC background, you'll probably know how to use the typical copy and paste commands in macOS. But there's a handy clipboard trick that's worth keeping in mind.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-999495" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/copy-paste-shortcut.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
In Windows, the Copy and Paste key combinations are <strong>Control-C</strong> and <strong>Control-V</strong>, respectively. On the Mac, it's very similar – all you do is use the <strong>Command (⌘)</strong> key instead of Control. 
<br/>
<br/>
But did you know that you can also paste text without its original formatting? Not knowing that this is possible on a Mac, many users paste text into a plain-format text editor to strip it of any styling before copying and pasting it again to its intended destination. But you don't have to do that.

            Netflix recreated an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> from the ground up for its newly released thriller "iHostage," a dramatization of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/22/apple-store-amsterdam-robbery/">real-life hostage crisis</a> that took place at Apple's Leidseplein retail store in Amsterdam in 2022.

<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Since filming inside an actual ‌Apple Store‌ was not possible, Netflix and the production team behind "iHostage" reconstructed a full-scale replica of the Amsterdam location. The recreation was designed to match the original ‌Apple Store‌'s layout and architecture, using advanced virtual production techniques to replicate the store's surrounding environment. 
<br/>
<br/>
To build the replica, the production team constructed the interior set on a soundstage, surrounded by a high-resolution LED wall. This display allowed the filmmakers to render a photorealistic virtual version of th [...]<br>
