<p id="k9HiAO">Comcast announced today that it’s expanding its “Now” branding to include two prepaid services: Now Internet and Now Mobile. Of the two, the mobile plan appears to be genuinely new, as it’s a prepaid cellular option that offers unlimited 5G data, talk, and text for $25 a month per line. The mobile plan also has free access to the company’s Xfinity hotspots<em>.</em></p>
<p id="bcOu9t">That seems like a better deal than Xfinity’s current prepaid mobile plans, which &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xfinity.com%2Fmobile%2Flearn%2Fplan%2Fdetails&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F4%2F17%2F24132851%2F</p> [...]<br>

Two weeks earlier, something — you rarely knew what — damaged the 13,000-mile fiber optic cable connecting Kitaibaraki, Japan, and Point Arena, California.

            Spotify's elusive lossless music experience is being teased again, this time based on code uncovered by <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/12/24128584/spotify-music-pro-lossless-audio">The Verge</a></em> in recent builds of the Spotify app for Android.

<br/>
More than three years have elapsed since Spotify announced its intention to offer a "HiFi" premium option that would give users access to a catalog of CD-quality music tracks. Originally the company said the tier would go live by the end of 2021, but a shift in the wider streaming market upended that idea.

<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> has since rolled lossless listening into its standard subscription price, while Amazon stopped charging extra for its lossless music library. The moves effectively kiboshed S [...]<br>

            <p>When playing solo D&amp;D, try making full on characters for the major NPCs. This can be more fun because (a) making characters is fun, especially higher level ones, and, (b) you get more faceted NPCs instead of just stock, one-dimensional characters.</p>
<p>I’ve been playing through <em>Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden</em>  and I applied this one of the  duergar dwarves, Durth. In the published adventure, he’s a Duergar Mind Master. Instead of sticking wiht that, I decided to flesh him out a bit, making him a 5th level Artificer. This gave him a steel defender companion and access to interesting spells. I’ve never really played an artificer or looked at that class next, so it was fun to imagine that out. And, then, when it came to the encounter on the ferry in Easthaven, I had a lot more options than what a Mind Master would give.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Introduction Rust&rsquo;s memory safety features are advantageous to Rust developers because they:
Ensure robust protection against buffer overflows and underflows, enhancing the reliability and security of software.
Empower developers to manage type coercion effectively, promoting code reliability and safety while facilitating safe type conversions.
Provide confidence in writing concurrent code by enforcing strict mutability rules and synchronization, thereby preventing data race issues and ensuring code correctness and efficiency.
With these memory safety features deeply integrated into Rust&rsquo;s design, developers can build more reliable, secure, and efficient software, spanning various aspects of memory management, type handling, and concurrent programming paradigms.<br>
