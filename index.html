            If you've been interrupted by your iPhone's Wallet app with unwanted promotional alerts, here's some good news: In iOS 26, currently in beta, Apple has listened to complaints and added a simple toggle to silence these marketing messages for good.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-26 23:21:40-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iOS 26 (currently in beta), Apple has finally caught up with rival podcast apps like Overcast by adding more fine-grained playback speed controls to the Podcasts app.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1015704" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/iOS-26-Podcasts-Glass-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
While competitors have long offered precise speed adjustments, Apple's rigid presets often left you caught between speeds that felt either too slow or uncomfortably fast.
<br/>
<br/>
In previous versions of iOS, Apple's stock Podcasts app provided only four fixed playback speed options: 1.25x, 1.5x, 1.75, and 2x. That's changed in iOS 26, and users now have a lot more flexibility.
<br/>
<br/>
Not only has Apple increased the range of playback speeds from 0.5x to 3x, the updated setting also allows you to adjust the speed in 0.1x increments, thanks to a new, more granular adjustment interface. 
<br/>

The enhanced dynamic range preserves details that would typically be lost in standard screenshots, making them ideal for sharing visual content or documenting app interfaces with greater fidelity.

Not now. Not anytime soon. In my experience working with engineering teams across industries, I’ve seen just how fast cloud infrastructure is evolving.

Services chief <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eddy-cue/">Eddy Cue</a> is apparently the most vocal advocate of a deal to buy AI firms to bolster the company's offerings. Cue previously supported propositions of Apple acquiring Netflix and Tesla, both of which Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> turned down. Other executives such as software chief Craig Federighi have reportedly been reluctant to acquire AI startups, believing that Apple can build its own AI technology in-house.
