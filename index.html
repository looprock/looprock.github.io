<br/>
This is easily the biggest news for the regular version of CarPlay in years, should Tesla actually follow through with offering the system in its vehicles.
<br/>
<br/>
As noted by Gurman, this would be a stunning reversal for Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk, who have long ignored customer requests to implement CarPlay. We shall see what ultimately happens, though. Musk could change his mind at any moment.

            <p>We’re solidly in the “you’re doing it wrong” era of AI hustling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The companies that are thriving in the AI era are doing much more than building models. They’re building systems. They’re aggregating data, governance and workflows into AI-ready infrastructure that delivers at scale. If you’re stuck in pilot purgatory, this is your roadmap out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The McKinsey survey shows one clear signal of progress – workflow redesign. The companies with more success in using effectively using AI, about half say they’re using technology not just to do things faster, but to essentially rewrite how their business works. Most are actively rebuilding how work moves between people and systems. It’s a shift from fine-tuning the old way to creating something new entirely–and that’s what separates real transformation from just minor upgrades.</p>

            <p>Your AI stack needs to have DevX, thus, a platform:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it’s a sign of maturity that even when you mix in cloud native development with the current AI hype, organizations are actually realizing that developers are still the internal customers who need platforms as products. You can’t just say ‘get on with it’ and hand them a box of tools,” said Daniel Bryant, head of marketing, Syntasso Ltd.'</p>

<p>Digital sovereignty is not a future trend — it’s happening now. Whether you’re in defense, finance, healthcare, or the public sector, the time to act is today.

<blockquote>
<p>According to data presented at the summit, the AI opportunity is massive – estimated at $400 billion in revenues over the next decade, with 75% tied to applications and services. Google’s $10 billion investment in Belgium and $5.5 billion in Germany for cloud infrastructure signals a strong commitment to the region. Sovereign solutions, powered by GPUs from NVIDIA and Google TPUs, enable organizations to build locally compliant, high-performance applications. The ultimate goal?

<br/>
The company's board of directors and senior executives "recently intensified preparations for Cook to hand over the reins," the report said.
<br/>
<br/>
While the report said that Apple is unlikely to name a new CEO before its next earnings report in late January, it went on to explain that an announcement early in the year would allow for a smooth leadership transition, ahead of Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in June and iPhone event in September.
<br/>
<br/>
No final decisions have been made, and the timing could change, the report said.

            It's hard to believe we're halfway through November already, as 2025 rapidly draws to a close with no firm signs of several smaller hardware updates we've been hoping to see before the end of the year, although we did get one surprising new iPhone accessory this week.

This week also saw the fifth anniversary of the very successful Apple silicon effort on the Mac, contrasted with the future of the iPhone Air seeming shakier than ever. On the software side, Apple made some more tweaks with the second beta of iOS 26.2 and released the Digital ID feature to allow users to add their U.S. passports to the Wallet app, so read on below for all the details!
