The first 36-second onboarding video, shared by <a href="https://x.com/M1Astra/status/1724506943425757367?s=20">@M1Astra</a>, is called "Input Training" and demonstrates how the user interacts with vision OS by looking at UI elements and selecting them using a double-tap gesture. The narrator says the following:
<br/>
<blockquote>Your eyes and hands are how you navigate Apple Vision Pro. You browse the system by looking, and it responds to your eyes. Simply look at an element and tap your fingers together to select it. It's like a click on your Mac. To scroll, pinch your fing</blockquote> [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-11-15 01:48:10-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WhatsApp is rolling out a new voice chats feature in groups that lets users start voice calls without disturbing everyone in the group.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922605" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/whatsapp-voice-chats.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
Previously in WhatsApp group chats, the only option was to start a voice call, which rings every member in the group. If no-one joins, the call doesn't go ahead. 
<br/>
<br/>
In contrast, voice chats can be initiated in a group without anyone joining, and users are prompted to join discreetly via a silent push notification. The feature is available for those WhatsApp groups with 33 to 128 members.
<br/>
<br/>
Group members not participating in the voice chat can see who is active in the call from the chat header and the Calls tab, and people can join or leave at any time. If the encrypted chat remains empty for 60 minutes, it automatically ends.

            Next year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> could feature a more power-efficient display thanks to a new OLED material set that is reportedly being developed by Samsung specifically for Apple.

<br/>
A material set includes a variety of components for OLED screens, such as capping layers (CPL), which adjust the optical characteristics of the screen. Each component is produced by a specialist manufacturer and supplied to Samsung, which then uses them to construct the final OLED panel.

A different composition of materials in the set can alter attributes of the OLED panel, such as lifespan, brightness, color accuracy, or manufacturing efficiency.
