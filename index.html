            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models will have several new camera-related features, according to an anonymous tipster who contacted <em>MacRumors</em> today.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010582" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iPhone-17-Pro-on-Desk-Centered-1.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
The tipster claimed to be familiar with an iPhone 17 Pro commercial that is allegedly being produced by a film company that has publicly listed Apple as one of its clients. <em>MacRumors</em> has not independently confirmed any of the information shared by the tipster, so skepticism is obviously warranted for now.
<br/>
<br/>
The tipster revealed three alleged iPhone 17 Pro features that have not been rumored previously:<ul><li>An upgraded Telephoto lens with up to <strong>8× optical zoom</strong>, compared to up to 5× optical zoom on the iPhone 16 Pro models. The lens can apparently move, allowing for continuous optical zoom at various focal lengths.</li></ul> [...]<br>

            Like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, iPadOS 26 adopts Apple's new Liquid Glass material, for an interface that's glossy, shiny, and more transparent than before.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-07-24 23:10:56-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            If you've just downloaded the iOS 26 public beta on your iPhone, the first thing you'll notice is the new Liquid Glass design overhaul, which adopts translucent elements throughout the system interface and in stock apps. 
<br/>
<br/>
On the Home Screen, the search bar, dock, and app folders are translucent. By default, app icons have a new layered glass look that gives them dimension, but there's also a new option for "Clear" glass-like icons. This setting turns your app icons transparent, and widgets too. So if you want the full glass effect, read on.

<br/>
In iOS 18, Apple introduced Dark Mode and Tinted app icons. With iOS 26 and iPadOS 26, Apple adds a third visual style – Clear – that removes the color from app icons and widgets, and applies reflective, translucent effects to make them appear see-through.
