<br/>
The new design rolling out for the Meta-owned social media platform is meant to be fresh, approachable, and simple, <a href="https://design.facebook.com/stories/whatsapp-user-interface-update/">according to WhatsApp</a>.

<br/>
WhatsApp says that sending photos and videos on iOS is now easier, thanks to a new attachment layout. Instead of a full screen menu, there's an expandable tray for accessing features when sending media, documents, polls, and more. 
<br/>
<br/>
Icons have been updated to a rounded, outlined style, and there are new illustrations with added animations for a "more playful" aesthetic.
