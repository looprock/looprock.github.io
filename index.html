            As everyone continues to demand that social media companies pay news orgs for the crime of sending them traffic, it’s becoming clear that fewer and fewer people are using social media for news any more, and social media sites simply are not a major driver of traffic to news orgs anyway.

Certain Bird Spiders, or American Tarantulas, live in a burrow like the Tarantula I have been telling you about, but their burrow is more perfect than hers.

When one of these Tarantulas comes home, the lid drops into the groove and fits so exactly one cannot tell where it joins.

BeReal has had no major data breach, but users may accidentally reveal sensitive information, the app has extensive data collection, and there are weak default privacy controls.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Starting with iOS 17, the Wallet app on iPhone may be able to show balances for a wider range of credit cards set up with Apple Pay, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-02/apple-wwdc-2023-mixed-reality-headset-ios-17-and-other-products-to-expect">report today from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. Currently, only the Apple Card's balance can be viewed in the app.

<br/>
"The Wallet app will get an upgrade as the company pushes deeper into financial services," wrote Gurman. "That could include the app tying deeper into third-party credit cards to show balance information, mirroring the experience of the Apple Card."
<br/>
<br/>
Like many other financial-related features, it is possible that the expanded credit card balance feature would only be available in the U.S. at launch.

            "Stray," an adventure game that lets players take on the role of a cat, will soon be available on the Mac. Introduced in 2022, Stray has previously been limited to Windows machines and PlayStation consoles.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
In Stray, a stray cat finds himself stuck in a walled city filled with robots and mutant bacteria. The cat must make his way back up to the surface with the help of B-12, his drone companion.
<br/>
<br/>
Stray offers third-person gameplay and it requires players to solve puzzles, bypass obstacles, and complete quests while avoiding monsters like Zurks (evil bacteria) and Sentinels (security bots). Much of the game is platform-based, involving climbing up various obstacles and interacting with the environment to open up new pathways. There are cat behaviors too, of course, such as sneaking, sleeping, meowing, and nuzzling up to NPCs to get pets.

            Apple today seeded the second betas of upcoming iOS 16.6 and iPadOS 16.6 updates to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test out the software head of its official launch. The public betas come just a day after Apple provided the second betas to developers.

<br/>
Those who have signed up their accounts for Apple's free beta testing program can enable the beta by opening up the Settings app, going to General, selecting Software Update, tapping on Beta Updates, and selecting the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/">iOS 16</a> Public Beta option.
<br/>
<br/>
iOS 16.6 seems to be a relatively minor update, although Apple does appear to be laying the groundwork for the launch of the previously announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/19/ios-16-6-imessage-contact-key-verification/">iMessage Contact</a> [...]<br>

            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a> customers who have opted to create a high-yield Apple Savings account through Goldman Sachs have been experiencing issues attempting to withdraw their money, according to a report from <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/apple-savings-account-customers-say-its-hard-to-get-their-money-out-of-goldman-sachs-bd8b9ccb">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>.

<br/>
Multiple customers who transferred thousands of dollars to the Apple Savings account have had to wait weeks for money transfers in some cases, and some customers have also had money disappear. Kevin Smyth from Minnesota, for example, attempted to transfer $10,000 from his Apple account to U.S. Bank in mid-May, but Goldman Sachs would not complete the transfer.
