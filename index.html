            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            WhatsApp has rolled out a new feature on iPhone that lets you set reminder alerts for specific messages that you want to come back to later.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786421" height="1266" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Whatsapp-Feature.jpg" width="2250"/>
<br/>
Available in version 25.25.74 of WhatsApp, the feature allows you to long press on any message in a conversation thread and select a new "Remind me" option in the popup menu. You can then choose between 2 hours, 8 hours, and 24 hours, or set a custom duration after which you will be alerted about it.
<br/>
<br/>
The new feature is useful for keeping track of important details that might otherwise get lost in busy chats. It's also a simple way to make sure you don't forget to reply to a message at a later time. Here's how to set your first message reminder in WhatsApp:

Amp is one of the many, and one of Adam's favorite agentic coding tools to use. What makes it different is how they've engineered to it to maximize what’s possible with today’s frontier models. Autonomous reasoning, access to the oracle, comprehensive code editing, and complex task execution. That's nearly verbatim from their homepage, but it's also exactly what Adam has experienced. They talk through all things agents, how Adam might have been holding Amp wrong, and they even talked through Adam's idea called "Agent Flow".

<br/>
Specifically, the teardown shows the new 40W to 60W charger is roughly the same size as Apple's 20W charger, despite its higher wattage for faster charging speeds. In other words, you are getting more power from a smaller charger, although the 40W to 60W model costs $39 in the U.S., while the 20W option costs $19.

Kuo was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-to-launch-low-cost-macbook/">first to reveal</a> that Apple is allegedly planning a more affordable MacBook. In late June, he said the laptop would have around a 13-inch display, and an A18 Pro chip. Kuo said potential color options include silver, blue, pink, and yellow, so the laptop could come in bright colors, like 2021-and-newer models of the 24-inch iMac.

<br/>
As noted in our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-16-vs-17/">buyer's guide</a>, the ‌iPhone 17‌ features Apple's biggest display upgrade to a non-Pro model in years, with a larger 6.3-inch display (up from 6.1 inches) and a 120Hz ProMotion display for refresh rates up to 120Hz. There are also some major camera improvements, faster performance, and big battery life gains. So what do these enhancements mean for users in real terms?

No one really knows what will work and what they’re doing yet. As we learned in the digital transformation craze of the 2010’s, this means failure == learning. And learning is what you need to do a lot of.</p>
<p>More so, this kind of rapid learning, innovation, and sense making is exactly what a platform like Tanzu Platform with Cloud Foundry is excels at, and has a long, proven history of supporting.</p>
<p>You focus on learning new business models, features for your apps, and what works by writing and deploying code instead of building containers and configuring infrastructure.</p>
<p>And, as I like to say, if your organization writes a lot of their own code, there’s a good chance you already have the Tanzu Platform in place, ready to use. Just ask around.</p>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-17 05:18:16-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The first reviews of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/apple-announces-iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> have been published by selected media outlets and YouTube channels, offering a closer look at the device ahead of its launch on Friday.

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1018140" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/iPhone-Air-Hands-On-Thumb-2.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
The main attraction of the iPhone Air is its ultra-thin 5.6mm design, but the device has a handful of compromises compared to the iPhone 17 Pro models, so is it still worth buying? The reviews set out to answer that question.
<br/>
<br/>
The compromises compared to the Pro models include shorter battery life, no Telephoto camera with up to 8× optical zoom, one speaker instead of two, a slower USB-C port for wired data transfer speeds, slightly lower maximum USB-C and MagSafe charging speeds, and a slightly slower 5-core GPU instead of a 6-core GPU.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 26's new Liquid Glass interface has been criticized for making some content illegible in certain circumstances, and now the UI design is reportedly causing another unusual visual problem for some users. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1019821" height="3030" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/ios-26-liquid-glass-dark-mode.jpg" width="5386"/>
<br/>
Liquid Glass adds subtle glowing effects to the corners of app icons, creating a dynamic glass-like appearance with depth and parallax effects. However, as noted by <em><a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-liquid-glass-optical-illusion-on-ios-26-is-driving-me-insane-2000659413">Gizmodo</a></em>, this design choice can produce an optical illusion that makes icons appear tilted. Users impacted by the phenomenon report feeling disoriented, with some experiencing dizziness from the perceived slanting effect.

Companies that actively use automation achieve up to 60% faster release cycles compared to those relying solely on manual testing. However, automation alone is insufficient.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>The new Use Model shortcut in Apple Shortcuts opens up a lot of possibilities. For example, I like to summarize a lot of pages. Sometimes, ChatGPT can’t get the text for those pages, or I don’t trust the text it retrieves. There’s a shortcut that will retrieve the cleaned up text of a page (as markdown). So, you can get that markdown, and with the new Use Model shortcut, you can summarize it and then send the markdown summary to Drafts. You could open the text up in another app to view, whatever you like, but as you can imagine, I like to catalog this stuff. Also, it can generate a little link to include for my newsletters link list.</p>
<p>You put this in your Sharesheet, and now when you’re reading the World Wide Web, you can get summaries real quick-like.</p>

            <p>In macOS Tahoe, you can finally export Apple Notes in markdown. This is great, and even exports images and handwriting from the Apple Pencil. You can also bulk export, which is great! Sadly, bulk exporting images and handwriting doesn&rsquo;t work. It saves the images and handwriting in a file called <code>Attachements</code>, but then in the actual note markdown, all references to images are to a file called <code>FallbackImage.png</code>. Also, it exports an sqlite database. I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s in there, it&rsquo;s all gobbledygook to me.</p><br>
