            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Google today announced the launch of a new <a href="https://store.google.com/product/google_home_speaker?hl=en-US">Google Home Speaker</a>, which has a more <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> mini-like design than prior versions of the smart speaker.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Priced at $100, the speaker has a squat, rounded shape with a 3D knit fabric covering and a colorful light ring at the bottom so you know when the speaker is listening. It comes in Jade, Berry, Porcelain, and Hazel. Google says the speaker offers richer, 360-degree sound, balanced acoustics, and the ability to pair multiple speakers together.
<br/>
<br/>
The speaker's design is reminiscent of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a>, but it isn't quite as round. Google is targeting the same price point, as Apple sells the ‌HomePod mini‌ for $99. It's been some time since Apple upgraded the ‌HomePod mini‌, but we  [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-10-01 08:55:25-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iFixit today disassembled the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a>, giving us a look at what's inside and how the ‌AirPods Pro 3‌ have changed in comparison to the AirPods Pro 2. 
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
Apple designed the ‌AirPods Pro 3‌ with a new foam-infused tip, and the design change is mainly visible under a microscope. You can see a small layer of foam at the top of the earbud where it meets the ear. 
<br/>
<br/>
The AirPods have a 0.221 Wh battery cell inside, while the case has a single 1.334 Wh battery. The AirPods Pro 2 had two battery cells inside the case, and the change explains why we're down to 24 hours of battery life from the case instead of 30 hours like the AirPods Pro 2. 
<br/>
<br/>
The case has fewer rare earth magnets inside, but they've been placed in different locations to ensure that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> and Qi 2 charging still works as expected.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The all-new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> comes in four distinct color options, so which should you choose? 
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
With its ultra-thin titanium frame, large display, and glass back, the ‌iPhone Air‌ takes a different aesthetic direction from the rest of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> lineup. This year's finishes emphasize lightness and subtle sophistication, reflecting the phone's positioning as Apple's thinnest and most design-focused device. 
<br/>
<br/>
Both Apple's frosted and bumper cases noticeably show the device's color. The Air's full-width camera plateau draws attention to the device's color even with a case, making it all the more important to choose wisely.

            <p>”Prioritize sovereignty where it matters most. Not every workload requires sovereign infrastructure — and overengineering can be costly and inefficient. Focus on areas where sovereignty is critical: AI workloads, sensitive data, and operations in regulated industries. Use edge computing to process data locally and reduce compliance risks. Localized cloud options, including sovereign clouds and regional vendors, can help meet legal requirements without compromising agility. A surgical approach to sovereignty ensures strategic alignment and cost-effectiveness.”</p>

            Amazon <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/amazon-new-echo-devices-alexa-plus">today announced</a> the launch of new Echo Dot Max, Echo Studio, Echo Show 8, and Echo Show 11 smart speakers, all of which are designed to work with <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-generative-artificial-intelligence">Amazon's Alexa+ AI assistant</a>.

The new speakers have faster chips with AI acceleration, and a custom sensor platform called Omnisense. Omnisense was created for ambient AI, and it leverages sensors and signals to act on events that are happening in the home. Amazon says it can do things like provide a reminder when a specific person walks in a room, or send an alert that the garage door is unlocked and it's after 10 p.m.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-30 15:48:32-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has seemingly confirmed Apple's work on an updated version of the Vision Pro headset.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1021632" height="626" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/fcc-vision-pro-leak.jpg" width="1110"/>
<br/>
One of several documents the FCC shared today references an Apple-designed "Head Mounted Device" with a model number of A3416. An included image confirms the device is a Vision Pro.
<br/>
<br/>
The FCC's uploads are transmission tests, SAR test reports, and WLAN test reports, so there's not a lot of additional product information available. We do know that the next Vision Pro will continue to have Wi-Fi 6, as there's no sign of 6GHz Wi-Fi in the testing that the FCC did. 
<br/>
<br/>
According to rumors, Apple is working on a refreshed version of the Vision Pro that has a faster M5 chip. The headset isn't expected to feature design updates, with Apple simply updating the  [...]<br>

            OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/sora-2/">today announced</a> the launch of Sora, an invite-only AI video app and social network. Sora lets you create realistic AI videos of yourself, friends, and other people.

            Generative AI agents in production environments demand resilience strategies that go beyond traditional software patterns. AI agents make autonomous decisions, consume substantial computational resources, and interact with external systems in unpredictable ways. These characteristics create failure modes that conventional resilience approaches might not address. This post presents a framework for AI agent resilience risk analysis […]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>&lsquo;JFrog Fly is the company’s agentic developer platform and an MCP server that works with multiple IDEs, including VS Code and Cursor. Integrated with GitHub and observability, Fly provides a chat interface that allows users to query, promote, and roll back existing releases based on specifics of the code (e.g., “Which features were added to this release?” or “Deploy the release that added styling to the user field”). Fly includes an audacious reimagining of the software development process, making versioning automatic and version names obsolete. This makes for a slick demo but may introduce confusion for JFrog clients who don’t want to give up their semantic versions or who need to support back-level software.&rsquo;</p>
