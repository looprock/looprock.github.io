            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Today's the day. Apple is about to release iOS 26, which will deliver the biggest redesign since iOS 7 and bring a range of new features and improvements to iPhones worldwide. It's Apple's biggest software update of the year, and Apple announced at last week's iPhone event that it will be releasing iOS 26 sometime today – Monday, September 15.

<br/>
Based on past releases, the update is likely to drop at around 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time/1:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Apple's own websites for countries around the world also suggest a 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time release, with Apple's site for India listing a September 15 launch while the company's Indonesian page lists a September 16 release, pointing to a narrow window around 10:00 a.m. Pacific to line up with time zone differences.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            A little more than three months ago, <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613">Aaron Perris</a> discovered references to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/ios-26-all-the-little-changes/">unreleased "Weather via satellite" feature</a> in the code for the first iOS 26 developer beta. However, just one day before iOS 26 is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/14/ios-26-available-tomorrow/">set to be widely released</a>, the feature has yet to be released or even announced by Apple.

<br/>
The references have not been removed from the code, as of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/apple-seeds-ios-26-rc/">iOS 26 Release Candidate</a>, so it is possible that Apple will introduce the feature eventually.

            iOS 26 will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/14/ios-26-available-tomorrow/">widely released tomorrow</a>, but the new feature that lets you add a digital version of your U.S. passport to Apple's Wallet app is still not available.

<br/>
The "Digital ID" feature is not functional in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/apple-seeds-ios-26-rc/">iOS 26 Release Candidate</a>, which is typically the final beta version, despite being listed on the <a href="https://www.apple.com/os/ios/">iOS 26 features page</a> in the present tense.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-14 11:48:59-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Last week, we listed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/10/airpods-pro-3-features/">eight new AirPods Pro 3 features</a>, including a U2 chip in the charging case. The addition of the U2 chip has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1ng3822/airpods_pro_3_have_the_u2_chip_in_the_case_now/">receiving a lot of attention</a> since then, so we wanted to single out its inclusion and discuss it in more detail.

<br/>
Until now, Apple only referred to the U2 chip as a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, but it is <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods/compare/">no longer shying away</a> from using a name that might remind Apple fans of the free U2 album that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2014/10/14/u2-apologizes-for-auto-downloads/">infamously added to everyone's iTunes account</a> in 2014.

<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/iphone-17-air-features-reported/">As rumored</a>, the iPhone Air only has a single speaker. The earpiece at the top of the device doubles as a speaker, but there is no speaker on the bottom of the device. The holes to the left and right of the USB-C port are for microphones. For stereo audio, use AirPods or a capable external speaker.</li>

<li>On the iPhone Air, the Dynamic Island is positioned slightly lower on the screen compared to the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro models. This was likely necessary due to the device's ultra-thin frame necessita</li></ul> [...]<br>

            Apple's next-generation iPhone 18, iPhone 18 Pro, and iPhone 18 Pro Max models will be equipped with a slightly smaller Dynamic Island, but the devices will not feature under-screen Face ID, according to the <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/Q4niosSS2">Weibo account Instant Digital</a>.

There were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/30/iphone-17-metalens-rumor/">conflicting rumors</a> about whether the iPhone 17 Pro models would have a smaller Dynamic Island, but its size did not change.

            In case you missed it, Apple's event this week included another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKphYoxGeRE">heartwarming video</a> about the Apple Watch's genuine life-saving potential.

"Real people share how Apple Watch has changed and even helped save their lives—a fitness story in New York, a teen's struggle with mental health in the UK and powerful health and safety stories from the U.S., Japan, and Canada," said Apple.

            The latest iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and iPhone Air models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/iphone-17-n1-chip/">equipped with Apple's all-new N1 chip</a> for Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread connectivity. However, the chip has a Wi-Fi 7 bandwidth limitation.

<br/>
According to FCC documents reviewed by <em>MacRumors</em>, the N1 chip in all of the new iPhone models supports up to 160 MHz channel bandwidth for Wi-Fi 7, short of the standard's 320 MHz maximum. This limitation means the devices cannot achieve the peak theoretical speeds possible with Wi-Fi 7, but real-world performance is typically already bottlenecked by internet service providers and other factors.

            Apple today announced its <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/retail/hornsby/">store at the Westfield Hornsby shopping mall</a>, in Hornsby, Australia, will be permanently closing next month.

<br/>
Hornsby is a suburb of Sydney, on the Upper North Shore. Apple opened its store there in 2011, and it will close for good on October 4, at 5 p.m. local time.
<br/>
<br/>
In a statement shared with some Australian media outlets a few months ago, Apple said it had decided not to renew its lease at Westfield Hornsby. Apple said all affected retail employees would be given the opportunity to work at Apple's nearby store <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/retail/chatswoodchase/">at the Chatswood Chase shopping mall</a>, in Chatswood, which is set to reopen in October.
