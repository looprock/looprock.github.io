            Apple Music is now available as an extension within ChatGPT, meaning you can search for songs, create playlists, and discover new music through OpenAI's chatbot. Here's how to set it up and what makes it worth using.

<h2>What You Can Do With Apple Music in ChatGPT</h2>
<br/>
ChatGPT's integration with Apple Music has the potential to change how you discover new music by letting you describe what you're looking for in natural language. Instead of typing specific search terms like you would in Apple Music, you can ask the chatbot for "upbeat 80s songs for a road trip" or "calm instrumental music for studying," and ChatGPT will understand the context and mood you're after.

            Apple's iPhone development roadmap runs several years into the future and the company is continually working with suppliers on several successive iPhone models at the same time, which is why we often get rumored features months ahead of launch. The iPhone 18 series is no different, and we already have a good idea of what to expect for the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max.

<br/>
One thing worth noting is that Apple is reportedly planning a major change to its iPhone release cycle this year, adopting a two-phase rollout starting with the iPhone 18 series. That means the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and iPhone Fold will be released in September 2026, followed by the iPhone 18 and iPhone 18e in spring 2027.

We don't know all of the details about iOS 27 yet, but we do have some information about what to expect.

<br/>
iOS 27 will apparently focus on bug fixes and under-the-hood improvements to boost performance rather than new features. It's been referred to as a "Snow Leopard" update, because that was a version of macOS that Apple famously claimed had "zero new features" because it was all about fixing the existing software.

With biometric unlocking, users can open the door hands-free, and the palm scan works even when the hands are wet.

            Dell announced the UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor at CES 2026, billing it as the "world's first 52-inch 6K display." 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031579" height="2160" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/dell-52-ultrawide-6k-thunderbolt@2x.jpg" width="3840"/>
<br/>
At 52 inches, the ultra-wide curved monitor features a 21:9 aspect ratio with 6,144 x 2,560 resolution at 129 pixels per inch and supports refresh rates up to 120Hz.
<br/>
<br/>
The display uses IPS Black panel technology for deeper blacks and improved contrast compared to standard IPS panels, with brightness listed as 400 cd/m. Dell says it emits up to 60% less blue light than competing monitors while maintaining professional-grade color accuracy, and it includes an ambient light sensor for eye comfort during extended use.

The display's connectivity support is pretty eye-watering, since it basically doubles as a Thunderbolt dock around the back. It includes one Thun [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is exploring multispectral imaging technology for future iPhone cameras that could improve Visual Intelligence, enhance material detection, and boost image processing, according to a new supply chain rumor out of China.

            Apple's adoption of a 200-megapixel camera for a future iPhone is still some ways off, according to a prominent supply chain leaker who says such a sensor is not currently part of Apple's active prototype testing.

In a <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/5252407685546916">post on Weibo</a>, Chinese leaker Digital Chat Station said that 200-megapixel camera sensors are being discussed in the supply chain, but they have not appeared in iPhone engineering prototypes undergoing real-world imaging tests. Instead, Apple's current camera development work is said to remain focused on refining 48-megapixel systems, as per previous reports.
