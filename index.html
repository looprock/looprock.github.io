            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Pathfinder and The Deerslayer stand at the head of Cooper's
      novels as artistic creations.  There are others of his works
      which contain parts as perfect as are to be found in these, and
      scenes even more thrilling.  Not one can be compared with
      either of them as a finished whole.

      The defects in both of these tales are comparatively slight.
      They were pure works of art.—Prof. Lounsbury.
      The five tales reveal an extraordinary fulness of invention.
      ... One of the very greatest characters in fiction, Natty
      Bumppo....

      The craft of the woodsman, the tricks of the trapper, all the
      delicate art of the forest, were familiar to Cooper from his
      youth up.—Prof. Brander Matthews.

      Cooper is the greatest artist in the domain of romantic fiction
      yet produced by America.—Wilkie Collins.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            To ensure secure communication over the public internet, JayP needs to address authentication, confidentiality, and integrity concerns. Digital certificates play a vital role in solving these issues. They verify the identity of websites like YouTube and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks by confirming the source of the public key. Certificate Authorities (CAs) sign digital certificates, creating a chain of trust. Operating systems include trusted root CAs, and websites obtain intermediate certificates from CAs. The browser verifies certificates' authenticity through hashing and decryption, ensuring secure connections. Three types of TLS certificates are explained: Single Domain (for one specific domain), Wildcard (for main domain and subdomains), and Multi-Domain (SAN, for multiple unrelated domains in one certificate).<br>

Except for Apple, whose stock took a bit of a beating because the company failed to sell as many iPhones as shareholders would have liked. Now, if you were to look at the company's financial results, its sales were down by 1% year-over-year, which doesn't sound like a lot — until you realize that at the scale of Apple, 1% in monetary terms is literally a billion dollars.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Did class distinctions play a role in determining the fate of those onboard, creating a divide between privilege and danger? How did age and gender influence who survived and who succumbed to the relentless sea? Amidst the chaos, did the presence of family members provide comfort and support, urging passengers to face the storm together? And did the port of embarkation influence the destinies of those who boarded from different locations?

Thankfully, we can answer these questions using the Titanic dataset available at Kaggle. More than a hundred years after it sank, we can use the data to understand how a ticket's price may have influenced survival and whether certain cabin locations provided refuge during the tragic events. This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will reveal insights into the passengers’ experiences, shedding light on their stories of courage and loss on that fateful night.<br>
