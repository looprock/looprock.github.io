            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple recently <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/">updated its online store</a> with a new ordering process for Macs, including the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, Mac mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro.

<br/>
There used to be a handful of standard configurations available for each Mac, but now you must configure a Mac entirely from scratch on a feature-by-feature basis. In other words, ordering a new Mac now works much like ordering an iPad.

            Google Maps now lets you talk to Gemini while following walking or cycling directions. The <a href="https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/maps/gemini-navigation-biking-walking/">latest update</a> is an extension to the AI chatbot's existing conversational navigation feature in driving mode that rolled out in November.

<br/>
You can now ask Gemini hands-free questions without leaving the navigation screen. While walking, for example, you can ask things like "Tell me more about this neighborhood" or "Are there cafes with a bathroom along my route?" Cyclists can also check their ETA without taking their hands off the handlebars.

<br/>
Prices for RAM and NAND storage chips are surging lately due to high demand from companies building out AI servers, resulting in supply constraints.
<br/>
<br/>
Cook said that rising memory chip prices had a "minimal impact" on Apple's gross margin in the fourth quarter of the 2025 calendar year, but he does expect a "bit more of an impact" on the company's gross margin in the current quarter.
<br/>
<br/>
Cook added that Apple is aware of the rising prices and "will look at a range of options to deal with that" over the long term, if necessary.

Postgres?</a>  It's an unusual talk because it explains the missing features of Postgres, and why.  One thing I learned in writing the talk is that the majority of our missing features
are performance-related, rather than functionality-related.  I took many questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>some pointed out that extensions supply much of this missing functionality
  </li><li>some supported the lack of features because the features are either unnecessary or harmful
  </li><li>some features are in-progress (<a class="txt2html" href="https://momjian.us/main/writings/pgsql/missing.pdf#page=31" style="text-decoration: underline dotted;">slide 31</a>)
