In the U.S., the Link Bracelet is available for $209 on Apple's online store for employees, down from $349 regularly. The Milanese Loop is available for $59, down from $99. Both bands were introduced alongside the original Apple Watch in 2015.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The iPhone 15 offers "lots of storage for lots of photos," or at least that's what Apple boasts in its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/apple-iphone-15-storage-ad/">latest ad</a>. Whether that rings true for you depends on what you do with your iPhone, and which storage option you choose. But before you open your wallet, here are some things to consider.

<br/>
The entry-level storage tier for the iPhone 15 is 128GB. That's a notable increase from the 64GB baseline that persisted until the iPhone 13 in 2021. When you consider that 2018's iPhone X came with as little as 64GB, the base storage option for Apple's latest device might even begin to sound generous.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            OLED panel supply issues may be partly behind Apple's iPad Pro launch delay, based on reports coming out of Korea.

<br/>
Apple's original plan was to rely on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/apple-has-two-suppliers-for-oled-ipad-pro/">different OLED display suppliers</a> for the upcoming iPad Pro models, with Samsung Display exclusively producing ~11-inch panels and LG Display responsible for the required ~13-inch panels. 
<br/>
<br/>
The division of labor was reportedly due to changes in Apple's demand outlook for OLED iPad Pro models, as well as the unstable production capacity and yield of the two suppliers, which are both still getting to grips with Apple's requirement for new panel technologies. 
<br/>
<br/>
Early reports suggested the new models could arrive as soon as this month. However, according t [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-03-28 16:38:48-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Oregon this week signed a Right to Repair bill into law, and it is notable because it is the first such law that puts a stop to the practice of parts pairing. Manufacturers like Apple are not able to require customers to use Apple-sourced parts that then have to be authenticated, with the bill giving Apple device owners the right to use new parts, used parts, or third-party parts.

<br/>
Apple has launched repair tools for both independent repair shops and consumers, but repair components must be purchased directly from Apple. Components must be paired with a device serial number after being installed, which prevents unauthorized repairs that use third-party components. The bill states that companies cannot reduce the performance of a device or display misleading warnings for parts that are not properly paired [...]<br>
