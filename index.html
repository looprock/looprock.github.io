<br/>
Apple is said to be closely aligned with TSMC in the race to develop and implement 2nm chip technology, which will surpass their current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> chips and associated nodes in terms of transistor density, performance, and efficiency. 2nm chips are expected to be integral in underpinning future Apple silicon chips, as well as next-generation data center and artificial intelligence technology. Test results for TSMC's "N2" 2nm prototype chips have already been showcased to Apple and several other key TSMC clients as plans for upcoming chips begin to solidify.

            <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> has won its antitrust lawsuit against Google, after the nine-member jury in the case unanimously agreed that the tech giant abused its power by operating an app store monopoly and charging developers unduly high fees.

<br/>
The unanimous verdict came after three hours of deliberation following a four-week trial looking into Google's Play store. Among Epic's allegations were that Google illegally tied together its Play store and Play Billing payment services, leaving developers having to use both for their apps to be included in the store.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The NYPD&#8217;s refusal to engage in nearly any form of accountability means it&#8217;s up to the city&#8217;s residents to pay billions for police work that adds tens of millions to the tab with lawsuit settlements. In 2022, the NYPD cost residents $121 million in settlements. This came on top of the NYPD&#8217;s budget, which cleared [&#8230;]<br>

            One of my favorite ways that lame trademark fights end is when the victim of the bullying makes slight changes to their branding such that it pokes the bully in the eye while still getting the victim out of legal harm&#8217;s way.

            <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>First, I’d like to sincerely thank everyone who has supported Highscalability over the years.</p>
<p>We’ve grown together through some interesting times. Massive changes have occurred in how systems are built, and my goal has always been to help people learn how to build them better. I’d like to think that goal was accomplished.</p>
<p>Obviously, for that last several years, things have been quiet around here. This has always been a one programmer show, and for everything, there is a season. The season for me is changing. That means http://highscalability.com is for sale.</p>
<p>My preference is for someone to take HS over and keep it going in some form or another. If you are a content farm, please don’t reply. I’ve never once taken payment for a post and I don’t plan on changing that now.</p>
<p>You get the site, the domain, and the twitter account. If you are not a scam artist and have a reasonable offer, please contact me at toddhoffious@gmail</p> [...]<br>
