Apple this week <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/117296">provided more insight</a> into how the feature works. There are no new health sensors in the watch, which is why it's available for older devices. The Apple Watch analyzes data collected from the heart sensor, using a new algorithm to see if there are signs of hypertension.

Hypertension alerts require 30 days of data, and the data collection starts when Hypertension Notifications are set up with the Health app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPh</a> [...]<br>

Amp is one of the many, and one of Adam's favorite agentic coding tools to use. What makes it different is how they've engineered to it to maximize what’s possible with today’s frontier models. Autonomous reasoning, access to the oracle, comprehensive code editing, and complex task execution. That's nearly verbatim from their homepage, but it's also exactly what Adam has experienced. They talk through all things agents, how Adam might have been holding Amp wrong, and they even talked through Adam's idea called "Agent Flow".

<br/>
Specifically, the teardown shows the new 40W to 60W charger is roughly the same size as Apple's 20W charger, despite its higher wattage for faster charging speeds. In other words, you are getting more power from a smaller charger, although the 40W to 60W model costs $39 in the U.S., while the 20W option costs $19.

Below, we recap the rumors about the lower-priced MacBook so far.

<br/>
Kuo was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-to-launch-low-cost-macbook/">first to reveal</a> that Apple is allegedly planning a more affordable MacBook. In late June, he said the laptop would have around a 13-inch display, and an A18 Pro chip. Kuo said potential color options include silver, blue, pink, and yellow, so the laptop could come in bright colors, like 2021-and-newer models of the 24-inch iMac.

            The first reviews of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/apple-announces-iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> have been published by selected media outlets and YouTube channels, offering a closer look at the device ahead of its launch on Friday.

<br/>
The main attraction of the iPhone Air is its ultra-thin 5.6mm design, but the device has a handful of compromises compared to the iPhone 17 Pro models, so is it still worth buying? The reviews set out to answer that question.
<br/>
<br/>
The compromises compared to the Pro models include shorter battery life, no Telephoto camera with up to 8× optical zoom, one speaker instead of two, a slower USB-C port for wired data transfer speeds, slightly lower maximum USB-C and MagSafe charging speeds, and a slightly slower 5-core GPU instead of a 6-core GPU.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 26's new Liquid Glass interface has been criticized for making some content illegible in certain circumstances, and now the UI design is reportedly causing another unusual visual problem for some users.

<br/>
Liquid Glass adds subtle glowing effects to the corners of app icons, creating a dynamic glass-like appearance with depth and parallax effects. However, as noted by <em><a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-liquid-glass-optical-illusion-on-ios-26-is-driving-me-insane-2000659413">Gizmodo</a></em>, this design choice can produce an optical illusion that makes icons appear tilted. Users impacted by the phenomenon report feeling disoriented, with some experiencing dizziness from the perceived slanting effect.

            Apple's first OLED MacBook Pro, set to enter mass production next year, will feature a touch screen display, according to <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1968249865940709538">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.

In his latest <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1968249865940709538">post on X (Twitter)</a>, Kuo writes that Apple's much-rumored OLED MacBook Pro will incorporate a touch panel using on-cell touch technology. On-cell touch technology integrates the touch sensors directly into the display panel's top layer (the "cell") rather than requiring a separate, dedicated touch layer.
<br/>
<br/>
Kuo says that the shift "appears to reflect Apple's long-term observation of iPad user behavior, indicating that in certain scenarios, touch controls can enhance both productivity and the overall user experience. [...]<br>

Companies that actively use automation achieve up to 60% faster release cycles compared to those relying solely on manual testing. However, automation alone is insufficient.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>The new Use Model shortcut in Apple Shortcuts opens up a lot of possibilities. For example, I like to summarize a lot of pages. Sometimes, ChatGPT can’t get the text for those pages, or I don’t trust the text it retrieves. There’s a shortcut that will retrieve the cleaned up text of a page (as markdown). So, you can get that markdown, and with the new Use Model shortcut, you can summarize it and then send the markdown summary to Drafts. You could open the text up in another app to view, whatever you like, but as you can imagine, I like to catalog this stuff. Also, it can generate a little link to include for my newsletters link list.</p>
<p>You put this in your Sharesheet, and now when you’re reading the World Wide Web, you can get summaries real quick-like.</p>

            <p>In macOS Tahoe, you can finally export Apple Notes in markdown. This is great, and even exports images and handwriting from the Apple Pencil. You can also bulk export, which is great! Sadly, bulk exporting images and handwriting doesn&rsquo;t work. It saves the images and handwriting in a file called <code>Attachements</code>, but then in the actual note markdown, all references to images are to a file called <code>FallbackImage.png</code>. Also, it exports an sqlite database. I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s in there, it&rsquo;s all gobbledygook to me.</p><br>
