This guide highlights everything that's new in iOS 18.1.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_intelligence">Apple Intelligence</h2>
<br/>
iOS 18.1 includes the first ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Pro models and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <strong>Update:</strong> After this story was published, Apple updated the tech specs for the new iMac to indicate that 10-core configurations support one external display with up to 8K resolution at 60Hz, not 120Hz. It appears that the original 8K at 120Hz mention in Apple's tech specs was an error. Apple still mentions 8K at 120Hz on its international websites, but those will likely be corrected soon as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Original story follows.

<br/>
<br/>
When configured with a 10-core M4 chip, the new iMac announced today <a href="https://www.apple.com/imac/specs/">supports up to an 8K external display at 120Hz</a>, or up to two 6K displays at 60Hz each.

            Apple has been gradually transitioning its products from Lightning to USB-C in recent years.

            To introduce the new M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> models today, Apple didn't hold a standard event, but the company did record a short keynote video to go through all of the machine's new features.

The 2021 ‌iMac‌ was the first of its kind to feature an Apple silicon chip, replacing previous Intel-based models with 21.5- and 27-inch displays. It offered an all-new ultra-thin design, a 24-inch Retina display, a six-speaker system with force-cancelling woofers, and an array of seven two-tone color options. The 2023 model was a minor update that added the M3 chip and specification updates like Bluetooth 5.3 and Wi-Fi 6E.

In this episode, we explore how Rust’s ownership and borrowing rules impact multithreaded programming, focusing on the complexities of managing memory in a concurrent environment. We’ll break down how Rust&rsquo;s strict borrowing and ownership model ensures safety and prevents common pitfalls like data races and undefined behavior, making it an ideal choice for building reliable multithreaded applications.
