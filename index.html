            The developers behind popular photography app Halide <a href="https://www.shotwithkino.com/">today announced the launch of Kino</a>, an app designed for capturing cinematic video. Kino has the tools that professionals need while also providing guidance to amateur videographers.

<br/>
Kino offers a one-tap video recording feature with support for a range of color presets. The Instant Grade feature allows users to choose presets created by experts or import their own LUTs. By applying color grading while recording, Kino saves time by removing the need for editing.
<br/>
<br/>
An AutoMotion feature helps users capture cinematic movement in a shot by using a 180-degree shutter angle by default. When enough ambient light is available, the Auto label will turn green to indicate that it is an ideal time to capture motion.

Job Simulator is a VR game where automation and robots have replaced all human jobs. Players can relive what it was like to work as a human with not-so historically accurate recreations of jobs that include an office worker, gourmet chef, and store clerk.
<br/>
<br/>
The game uses hand tracking for control purposes, which means no controller is required. Hands can be used for interacting with, throwing, and smashing objects.
<br/>
<br/>
Vacation Simulator is similar to Job Simulator, but it provides a simulated vacation experience. Activities include ice sculpting, swimming, knitting mittens, building snowhumans, doing yoga, painting, taking sel [...]<br>

The LEGO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a>'s design isn't made to resemble a specific store, but instead uses the design elements that Apple has incorporated into many of its locations. There's an all-glass facade with trees in pots, minifigures in classic Apple blue shirts, and an upstairs area reached by a set of stairs.

<p id="Z0z1mk">This menu — which displays information about Edge’s performance — is now 42 percent faster, thanks to a WebUI 2.0 architecture migration. You can see how much faster the Browser Essentials menu loads on WebUI 2.0 compared to React and WebUI with Javascript in the video below. Microsoft says the menu is 76 percent faster on devices without an SSD or with less than 8GB of RAM.</p>
