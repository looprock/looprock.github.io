<em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=38912">The Elec</a></em> reports that Apple has set a two-year production plan for the superior OLED technology to be adapted for iPhone models. However, Apple has yet to decide whether to develop the panels in partnership with Samsung Display or LG Display, suggesting iPhones with tandem OLED won't arrive until sometime after 2028.

            Along with the iPhone 18 Fold expected to launch in late 2026, Apple is working on a larger-screened foldable device that could be a MacBook-iPad hybrid of some sort.

Established in 2013, Apple Cinemas maintained a limited presence in the Northeastern U.S. until last month, when it opened a theater in San Francisco.

Like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, macOS Tahoe adopts the Liquid Glass design. It's used for the Dock, widgets, Control Center, menu bars, navigation bars in apps, app icons, and a few other places, but its implementation is less widespread than it is in iOS and iPadOS. It's clear that Liquid Glass was not a Mac-first design, and the glass parts of the interface feel cobbled together with the previous design language.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            CalDigit recently came out with the TS5 Plus, which is designed to work with Apple's Thunderbolt 5 Macs.

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012987" height="1216" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/caldigit-ts5-plus.jpg" width="2162"/>
<br/>
The TS5 Plus looks like CalDigit's prior docks, featuring a simple rectangular shape and an aluminum build with some ridging at the top, bottom, and sides for visual interest and heat dissipation.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a black aluminum color that matches the Space Black of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macbook-pro/">M4 MacBook Pro</a> models, and it comes with a hefty 330W power brick. In fact, the power brick is longer than the dock itself, but it's flat and tucks away under a desk fairly well. The TS5 Plus is six inches long, five inches wide, and 1.8 inches thick, while the power brick is seven inches long, 3.5 inches wide, and a little under an inch thick.

Apple updated the list to move the Series 1 Apple Watch models from the vintage section to the obsolete section, as it has now been more than seven years since the devices were last offered for sale.

            In iOS 26, currently in beta, your iPhone gains a handy new charging feature that takes the guesswork out of knowing when your device will be fully powered up. Instead of waiting around or checking your battery percentage every few minutes, you can now see exactly how much time remains until your device reaches 100%.
