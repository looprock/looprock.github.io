            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Google is continuing on with its relentless #GetTheMessage marketing campaign in an attempt to get Apple to adopt the RCS messaging protocol. In its latest ad, Google shows off the "iPager," which Google describes as a device that "uses outdated messaging tech" like Apple uses "when texting with Android."

<div class="center-wrap"></div>

RCS, or Rich Communication Services, is a communication protocol designed by and adopted by Google. Google has been pushing Apple to implement support for RCS, but Apple devices continue to support the older SMS protocol. Google claims that Apple is responsible for all the issues that Android and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users have texting one another, including lack of encryption, broken group chats, pixelated pictures and videos, and the green bubbles.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-09-21 09:37:54+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Bonding curves are mathematical functions increasingly used in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) to link the supply of a digital asset with its value. They enable automated, fair valuation of assets, allowing tokens to be issued without reliance on traditional exchanges, order books, or centralized control. This promotes liquidity and project financing, reducing token manipulation risks. In Obyte, an Autonomous Agent (AA) operates as an Automated Market Maker (AMM), handling issuance, redemption, and reserve storage, ensuring decentralized operation. There are two models of bonded stablecoins, v1 and v2, each addressing price stability differently. Bonding curves are also employed in prediction markets like Prophet and governance tokens such as OSWAP for liquidity provision and governance participation. Overall, bonding curves enhance DeFi's automation, effectiveness, and decentralization.<br>
