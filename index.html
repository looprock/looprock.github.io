            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is planning to unveil its new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models in September, but Google decided to move its usual October smartphone announcement to August, beating Apple to new AI-powered devices. We picked up Google's new Pixel 9 Pro XL and thought we'd compare it to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max since we don't have an ‌iPhone 16‌ to pit against it just yet.

Design wise, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> look and feel, and Google has done a lot better matching software with a high-end smartphone design.

            As part of a "shift in priorities," Apple has made cuts to its workforce across senior VP Eddy Cue's Services division, <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/apple-cuts-about-100-services-jobs-as-part-of-priority-shift">Bloomberg</a></em> reports.

The scope of the layoffs extended beyond a single team, with some employees working across multiple departments feeling the ripple effects of Apple's apparent cost-optimization effort. The layoffs primarily affected the Apple Books app and Apple Bookstore teams, but also impacted the Apple News team, marking the fourth round of staff reductions for the company in 2024.

            Next year's iPhone 17 models will come with 12GB of RAM, up from the 8GB of RAM expected across Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 models, a reputable source of accurate predictions about Apple's plans has claimed.

<br/>
Onboard memory in the existing iPhone 15 lineup is different between non-Pro and Pro models: The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature 6GB of RAM, while the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max come with 8GB of RAM. This difference is said to be the reason why Apple Intelligence – Apple's AI suite of on-device features – is only currently supported by the iPhone 15 Pro models.
