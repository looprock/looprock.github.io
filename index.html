            Employees at Apple retail stores are planning for overnight updates following the September 12 "Wonderlust" event, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1699151590039376107"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

Gurman suggests that the overnight update could be because Apple is planning for near-immediate availability of new products after the event, but it could also be time that is used to put up new marketing materials. It is not unusual for Apple retail stores to receive overnight updates ahead of new product launches.

<p>Each year, Etsy hosts an event known as  “CodeMosaic” - an internal hackathon in which Etsy admin propose and build bold advances quickly in our technology across a number of different themes.  People across Etsy source ideas, organize into teams, and then have 2-3 days to build innovative proofs-of-concept that might deliver big wins for Etsy’s buyers and sellers, or improve internal engineering systems and workflows.</p>
<p>Besides being a ton of fun, CodeMosaic is a time for engineers to pilot novel ideas. Our team’s project this year was extremely ambitious - we wanted to build a system for stateful machine learning (ML) model training and online machine learning. While our ML pipelines are no stranger to streaming data, we currently don’t have any models that learn in an online context - that is, that can have their weights updated in near-real time.</p>

businesses should start using Postgres.  It covers Postgres's structural benefits like vendor independence, code quality, and technology like NoSQL.  It also covers the challenges that
could be faced, like cost, time, and in-house expertise.  When I saw "Not controlled by a single vendor" in both the benefits and challenges sections, I knew he was on the right track!

Wilson put on enough clothes for business purposes and went to work under a high pressure of steam. He was awake all over. All sense of weariness had been swept away by the invigorating refreshment of the great and hopeful discovery which he had made. He made fine and accurate reproductions of a number of his “records,” and then enlarged them on a scale of ten to one with his pantograph. He did these pantograph enlargements on sheets of white cardboard, and made each individual line of the bewildering maze of whorls or curves or loops which constituted the “pattern,” of a “record” stand out bold and black by reinforcing it with ink.

The discussion comes ahead of the publication of the first list of services to be regulated by the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The legislation introduces new rules that apply to tech giants that meet its "gatekeeper" criteria and force them to open up their various services and platforms to other companies and developers.
