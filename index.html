            <b>Published:</b> 2024-06-05 07:47:38-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has tested a redesigned version of Control Center with a customizable layout for iOS 18, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. However, we have not confirmed if this change has been finalized for the update.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952915" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iOS-18-Control-Center-Feature-Iridescent-1.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
The new Control Center would feature a drag-and-drop system that allows at least some of the controls to be reorganized directly on the interface, our sources said. Currently, only the smaller controls in the bottom half of Control Center for things like the flashlight and Low Power Mode can be rearranged or removed through the Settings app. 
<br/>
<br/>
If this plan moves forward, it would represent the biggest redesign to Control Center since iOS 11 was released in 2017. On the iPhone X and newer, the menu can be opened by swiping down from the top-right corner of the  [...]<br>

            Apple could soon launch its annual Back to School promotion for university students in the United States and Canada, based on ads that have been popping up on social networks.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
On Instagram, Apple is promoting Macs to college and university students. The ad in question depicts a Back to School image with the following text: "Buy Mac for university or college with education savings. Plus get a gift card for up to $200." The screenshot of the ad is from a Canadian user, and that price point suggests we will see the same $150 discount in the United States that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/06/apple-launches-2023-back-to-school-promotion/">provided last year</a>.

            Several current and former employees of OpenAI and Google DeepMind today <a href="https://righttowarn.ai">shared an open letter</a> warning of the dangers of advanced AI and the current lack of oversight of companies working on AI technology.

<br/>
The employees suggest there are a number of risks that we are facing from AI development, including further entrenchment of existing inequalities, manipulation and misinformation, and loss of control of autonomous AI systems, which the letter says could lead to human extinction.

<br/>
AI companies have "strong financial incentives" to forge ahead with development and to avoid sharing information about their protective measures and risk levels.

Foremost, this is the first Nintendo emulator on the App Store that costs money. Folium developer Jarrod Norwell is charging $4.99 for the app, which is a bold choice given that Nintendo recently sued the developers of Yuzu, a Nintendo Switch emulator that made a profit off a subscription-based "early access" tier.
