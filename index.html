            I have not thought or said much about DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) over the years.

Whether you call it football, fútbol, or soccer, the sport with the round ball returns soon.

In the United States, MLS Season Pass is priced at $14.99 per month or $99 per season, and it provides access to all regular season and playoff matches. MLS Season Pass is available in the Apple TV app on Apple devices, most smart TVs, and many other streaming devices and game consol [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Stationery Pad is a handy way to nix a step in your workflow if you regularly use document templates on your Mac. The long-standing Finder feature essentially tells a file's parent application to open a copy of it by default, ensuring that the original file remains unedited. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-989079" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/stationery-pad.jpg" width="1920"/>
<br/>
Stationery Pad doesn't get much attention these days, but it's a neat alternative to repeatedly editing templates and using the "Save As..." command, which can lead to overwriting the original file if you're not too careful.
<br/>
<br/>
Almost any file type can be defined as a template with Stationery Pad – it could be used to streamline common Photoshop jobs, create skeleton HTML/CSS files, or help with Word document invoicing. To make use of Stationery Pad, create the file you want to use as a template, then follow the steps below.

            In a stunning escalation that confirms our worst fears, the UK government has finally shown its true hand on encryption — and it&#8217;s even worse than we predicted.

<br/>
Made in a Voronoi style with multiple cutouts in a polyurethane material, the cover fits onto the front of the Vision Pro. The cover does not block any of the sensors or buttons on the Vision Pro, so it can be left on the device at all times, which is useful for VR games and activities that might lead you into walls.

<br/>
Dbrand developed the case after seeing a 3D printed version from Kyle Goodrich, a former AR designer at Snap. Apple bundles the Vision Pro with a protective cover, but Apple's cover is designed to be i [...]<br>
