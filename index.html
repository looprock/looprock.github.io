            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iPhone 16 models will feature upgraded microphones with a higher signal-to-noise ratio compared to previous models, allowing for the devices to hear your voice more clearly, according to Haitong analyst Jeff Pu. This upgrade should improve the accuracy of Siri, which is expected to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">revamped with generative AI features on iOS 18</a> later this year.

<br/>
In a research note earlier this month, Pu said some of iOS 18's generative AI features will likely be limited to iPhone 16 models, as a result of the upgraded microphones and a larger Neural Engine in the A18 and A18 Pro chips for the devices.

The rumor comes from Weibo user "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/setsuna-digital/">Instant Digital</a>," who claims that while new ‌AirPods Max‌ will "definitely" come out this year, the only change will be a USB-C port. The headphones will apparently continue to forgo Adaptive Audio due to the presence of an older processor.
