            The United States Justice Department is in the "late stages" of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/15/doj-ramping-up-apple-antitrust-probe/">an antitrust investigation</a> into Apple that could soon lead to an antitrust lawsuit, reports <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/05/technology/antitrust-apple-lawsuit-us.html">The New York Times</a></em>. The DoJ could be ready to file a "sweeping" antitrust case in the first half of 2024, with the agency considering how Apple's control over hardware and software locks consumers into the Apple ecosystem and makes it difficult for rivals to compete.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Following the Apple Card savings account's recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/apple-card-savings-account-apr-increase/">rate increase to 4.35%</a>, we have put together this guide comparing the annual percentage yields (APYs) of some popular high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs) available to U.S. residents.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Apple's rate now matches that of popular HYSAs offered by the likes of American Express, Capital One, and Discover, but there are a handful of other options that offer even higher APYs in the 4.5% to low 5% range, such as Marcus by Goldman Sachs and Wealthfront. Balance limits and other requirements vary.

There are many other HYSAs not listed in our chart, so be sure to do your research before deciding which option is best suited for you.

            Apple will be reopening its <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/baystreet/">Bay Street retail store</a> in Emeryville, California on Monday, January 8 at 10 a.m. local time, according to the company's website.

<br/>
The store had been closed for renovations since early September, according to <a href="https://michaelsteeber.substack.com/p/clearing-the-table"><em>Tabletops</em></a>, a weekly newsletter about Apple retail published by <a href="https://departmentmap.store/">Michael Steeber</a>. However, it is currently unclear if the store will have any public-facing changes when it reopens, or if the renovations are limited to the backroom area for staff members.
<br/>
<br/>
The store originally opened in 2002, becoming Apple's 50th retail location in the U.S., and moved to its current location on Bay Street in 2016.

It is not unusual that iOS 17.2 is no longer being signed.

            Samsung this week announced its 2024 Unpacked event, which is set to be held on January 17 in San Jose, California.

Samsung's event announcement teases a "new era of mobile AI," so it's safe to say that Samsung's new smartphones will have enhanced AI capabilities on par with ChatGPT and other AI products.

            Hello 2024! We’re kicking off the year with Dan Moore, author of ‘Letters to a New Developer’ — a blog series of letters of what Dan wished he had known when starting his developer career. We discuss the value of online communities for new developers, the importance of communication skills, and the need to stay relevant in a rapidly changing industry. Dan shares his best advice for new developers, including the importance of saying no, leaving code better than you found it, and the value of skill stacking. So much wisdom and advice in this episode!<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-01-04 03:34:36-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple will likely acquire the fitness company Peloton this year, a new hedge fund manager forecast claims.

<br/>
Deepwater Asset Management's <a href="https://deepwatermgmt.com/deepwaters-2024-predictions/">annual forecast</a> for 2024 (via <em><a href="https://connectthewatts.com/2024/01/03/deepwater-predicts-apple-acquisition-of-peloton/">Connect the Watts</a></em>) says that Apple is likely to acquire Peloton sometime this year. The move would help Apple bolster its Fitness+ subscription service, adding workout equipment to compliment the Apple Watch and its existing activity tracking software. Absorbing Peloton's subscriber base of three-million users would ostensibly add about $1.7 billion to Apple's subscription revenue and line up with its continued investment in health and wellness, the company claims.
