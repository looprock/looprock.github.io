            <b>Published:</b> 2025-03-18 08:53:02-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Have you noticed your iPhone videos keep playing on repeat in the Photos app? Since Apple's iOS 18.2 update, the stock Photos app automatically replays videos until you manually pause them – a feature that might be fine at first but can quickly become annoying, especially with longer clips.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-897381" height="470" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/icloud-photos.jpg" width="836"/>
<br/>
The auto-loop feature can be fun for short clips or when showing someone a quick video, but it forces you to take action to stop each video rather than letting it end naturally. It can be disruptive when you're browsing through multiple short clips in your library, and proves particularly annoying when viewing longer content where you likely don't want to see the same three-minute video play twice in a row.
<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, Apple provides a simple toggle to disable the behavior:

While choosing between ‌iPad‌ keyboards is now a clear-cut issue since there is only one available for each type of ‌iPad‌, it is now even more important to consider their slightly different features and designs when choosing an ‌iPad‌.

In a research note today with investment firm GF Securities, Pu shared a chart in which he reiterated that the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will each be equipped with a 24-megapixel front camera. By comparison, all four iPhone 16 models are equipped with a 12-megapixel front camera.

Another analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo, also claimed that at least one iPhone 17 model <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/kuo-iphone-17-to-feature-24mp-front-facing-camera/">would be equipped with a 24-megapixel front camera</a>, so this upgrade has been rumored by multiple sources.
