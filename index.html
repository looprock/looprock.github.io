            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple is weighing up the use of micro-lens technology to maintain the brightness of OLED displays on next year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models while reducing their power consumption, reports <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=22829">The Elec</a></em>.

<h2 id="understandingthedarkweb"><strong><em>Understanding the Dark Web</em></strong></h2>
<p>\
As we have learned in our previous blogs, the Dark Web constitutes a part of the Deep Web, where unindexed and non-searchable content lies hidden from traditional search engines. This obscured domain is accessible only through specialized software like Tor (The Onion Router), providing users with anonymity and privacy. However, the Dark Web’s anonymity has also made it a haven for illicit activities, making OSINT all the more crucial in understanding and combating cybercrime.</p>
<p>\
<strong><em>Clear Web</em></strong>*: Publicly accessible internet indexed by search engines. \n <strong>Deep Web</strong>: Non-indexed content, not freely accessible. \n <strong>Dark Web</strong>: Hidden, encrypted, and known for illegal activities.</p>
