            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Leonardo da Vinci found in drawing the readiest and most stimulating way of self-expression. The use of pen and crayon came to him as naturally as the monologue to an eager and egoistic talker. The outline designs in his "Treatise on Painting" aid and amplify the text with a force that is almost unknown in modern illustrated books. Open the pages at random. Here is a sketch showing "the greatest twist which a man can make in turning to look at himself behind." The accompanying text is hardly needed. The drawing supplies all that Leonardo wished to convey.
Unlike Velasquez, whose authentic drawings are almost negligible, pen, pencil, silver-point, or chalk were rarely absent from Leonardo's hand, and although, in face of the Monna Lisa and The Virgin of the Rocks and the St. Anne, it is an exaggeration to say that he would have been quite as highly esteemed had none of his work except the drawings been preserved, it is in the drawings that we realise the extent of "that continent called Leonardo."

            Verified writers have the ability to publish directly to the HackerNoon site without going through our editorial team. They are honored on the HackerNoon platform with a green verified checkmark next to their username.

We give these writers the ability to bypass the second human rule, only because they’ve gone through our editorial process many times and have consistently written publishable and outstanding content. They have effectively gone through our second human rule countless times and have gained the trust of our editorial team. 

Verified writers are longtime contributors, writers who have completed our Hackership program, or are alumni of our blogging fellowship.

While verified writers have the option to publish directly to the site, they can of course still take advantage of our free editing service and submit the story to our team of seasoned editors.

Our editorial team also routinely go through the content published by our verified writers to make sure all guidelines are followed.<br>

            1.a. Second Human Rule

The second human rule was invented by HackerNoon’s CEO and is part of the foundation on which HackerNoon was built. 

It is the idea that:

“​​Before publishing something online, a second human should consume the content, confirm it's something that should be distributed, and if possible, improve the content quickly before publishing.”

At HackerNoon every article goes through a second human (who didn’t write it) before publication. The only exception to this rule is those who publish under our verified writer accounts.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 include a new Screen Distance feature that can alert you when you hold an iPhone or iPad too close to your eyes for an extended period. Apple says the opt-in feature is designed to help lower the risk of nearsightedness in children by encouraging healthy viewing habits, and can help reduce eye strain overall.

<br/>
Screen Distance can be turned on in the Settings app under Screen Time → Screen Distance, and is available on all iPhone and iPad Pro models with Face ID. The feature uses the same TrueDepth camera that powers Face ID to measure the distance between the screen and your eyes, and a full-screen alert prompts users to move their device farther away after holding it closer than 12 inches to their eyes for an extended period.

How does the human mind work that lets anything external have an effect? What is the procedure of inputs to the mind that allows some result in affect and others to not? How does the mind work, given by biological neural networks that can be used to explain artificial neural networks? How is it possible to be able to train the mind, to better spot fake and sort original, or to have a bifurcation of both?
