In a Tab Group, you can easily collect and save related tabs, which can be especially advantageous in scenarios where collaboration and coordination are key. For instance, teams working on research projects can compile relevant sources into a shared group, allowing everyone to stay aligned and contribute in real time.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-05-06 06:08:30-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Microsoft's Skype has finally shut down, concluding its 22-year tenure as the once-dominant internet calling and messaging service.
<br/>

<br/>
Microsoft acquired Skype in 2011 for $8.5 billion in what was then its largest-ever acquisition. At its peak, Skype had more than 300 million monthly active users and was synonymous with internet-based voice and video calling. For many, Skype was their first experience of speaking to someone halfway across the world for free, a radical shift from the dominance of telcos and expensive long-distance calls.

<br/>
The service steadily declined in relevance in recent years, with its active user base shrinking to approximately 36 million by 2023 as competitors such as Zoom, WhatsApp, and Microsoft's own Teams platform gained traction.

Teams has since grown to 320 million monthly users [...]<br>
