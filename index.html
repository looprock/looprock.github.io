So I plunked down $20 and decided to see how Gemini Advanced stood up to the rival service.</p>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-02-13 04:07:33-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iMessage will avoid regulation requiring interoperability with other messaging platforms under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), following the conclusion of an investigation by the regulator (via <em><em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-13/apple-imessage-microsoft-bing-dodge-eu-s-big-tech-crackdown">Bloomberg</a></em></em>).

<br/>
The probe concluded that the iMessage platform and Microsoft's Bing do not hold a dominant enough position to be brought under the DMA's strict rules for services provided by big tech's so-called digital "gatekeepers," which include Apple, Meta, Google, Amazon, and TikTok, according to the EU.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple and Microsoft said they welcomed the decision to not designate them as core platform services in separate statements following the announcement.
