            <b>Published:</b> 2025-08-07 01:18:33-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, currently in beta, creating a new task for Apple's Reminders app is now a much faster process, thanks to the introduction of a "New Reminder" control that lets you create tasks without ever opening the app. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010930" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/ios-26-reminders-app-control-center.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
Whether you assign it to Control Center, your Lock Screen, or the Action button (on iPhone 15 Pro models and newer), this simple addition should make it a lot easier to record your reminders.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How the New Reminder Control Works</h2>
<br/>
When you activate the New Reminder control, the Reminders app isn't actually opened. Instead, iOS 26 displays a compact popup panel that includes everything you need to create a task: you can select the Reminders List, add a note, the date, location, and a flag.

<br/>
Sonos manufactures its devices in Vietnam and Malaysia, and the countries are facing tariffs of 20 percent and 19 percent, respectively. In the third fiscal quarter, tariffs cost Sonos $2.1 million, and the company estimated that costs would increase to $5 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2025. Sonos said that the estimate for 4Q 2025 reflects the prior 10 percent tariff rate on in-transit inventory that will arrive during the quarter, and future quarters "may differ."

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Medical technology company Masimo has been facing off with Apple in court since 2020, and while Masimo has scored some wins, it's been an expensive endeavor.

In its quarterly earnings reports, Masimo outlines how much it has spent on litigation. The way Masimo's spending is reported has changed over the last five years, but looking at earnings reports give a general idea of the cost to sue Apple and how those costs can balloon.

<br/>
Masimo's ITC case against Apple began in 2021, and it ultimately led to an Apple Watch import ban.

<br/>
Companies that are building in the United States, or that have made a commitment to build in the U.S., will not have to pay the tariffs. Since Apple pledged <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/06/apple-american-manufacturing-program/">to spend $600 billion</a> on U.S. manufacturing, the company will presumably be exempted from the planned chip tariffs.
<br/>
<br/>
"If you're building in the United States, or made a commitment to build or are in the process, there's no charge," Trump said. He added that if companies promise to bring manufacturing to the U.S. and don't follow through, tariffs will be "added up" and "charged at a later date."
