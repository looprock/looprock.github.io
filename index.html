            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            When U.S. President Donald Trump levied 145 percent tariffs on goods imported from China, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> started working to score Apple an exemption that would keep <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> costs down.

<br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/04/17/apple-iphone-tariff-exemption-trump/">The Washington Post</a></em>, Cook had a phone call with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick last week, explaining how the tariffs would cause ‌iPhone‌ prices to increase. He talked to senior White House officials about the tariffs, and made sure not to say anything negative in public about Trump's policies that would anger Trump. For Trump's inauguration, Cook also personally donated $1 million.

Instead, there&#8217;s just the concerted, but effective, efforts of a small group of people who feel everyone else&#8217;s rights end where their morality begins.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's Beats brand today shared a new ad in its ongoing Pill People series, this time highlighting the various USB-C cables that Beats <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/15/beats-charging-cables/">debuted earlier this week</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
The Pill People ad campaign features anthropomorphized Beats Pill speakers with different personalities. Beats has been using the Pill People since it launched the updated Beats Pill <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/25/beats-pill-bluetooth-speaker-announced/">last summer</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple's Beats brand is now offering several USB-C cables, including USB-C to USB-C, USB-C to USB-A, and USB-C to Lightning. The cables come in 1.5-meter and 20-centimeter options, with both sizes priced at $18.99. The cables come in four colors, and they can be purchased from the online <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/17/beats-cables-now-in-ap [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Google has an illegal monopoly in online advertising, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema said today. Google is guilty of "willfully acquiring and maintaining monopoly power" in the publisher ad server market that websites use for ads and the open-web display ad exchange market that matches advertisers with websites.

<br/>
Publishers that wanted to use Google's ad exchange were also required to use its ad server, which disadvantaged competing platforms. Google's "First Look" feature gave its ad exchange the first right of refusal for impressions, and "Last Look" let its platform assess bids from competitors before making its own bid.

Google later rolled out Unified Pricing Rules limiting the pricing strategies that publishers used to reduce dependence on Google ads and screen out low-quality content, which th [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18.4, Apple added a new Shortcuts action to open a specific conversation in the Messages app. This means it's now possible to open a chat thread with someone important to you straight from your Lock Screen, for example. Keep reading to learn more.

Yesterday, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/apple-vision-air-rumored-with-new-design/">the leaker explained</a> that the Apple "Vision Air" will feature a thinner design and switch the battery enclosure and several of its internal structures to titanium to reduce the device's overall weight. Most of the exterior of the device will continue to be aluminum, except with a "Midnight" bluish-black finish. Today's Vision Pro is only available in silver.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iPhone development roadmap runs several years into the future and the company is continually working with suppliers on several successive iPhone models simultaneously, which is why we often get rumored features months ahead of launch. The iPhone 17 series is no different, and we already have a good idea of what to expect from Apple's 2025 smartphone lineup.

If you skipped the iPhone 16, or if you're just plain curious about what's on the horizon, here are 17 rumored features that we are expecting to arrive in time for Apple's successor lineup, the iPhone 17 series, which is likely to be released around mid-September.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-04-17 03:26:29-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has seemingly had one of its most useful AI tools blocked from Meta's apps. Writing Tools, which is an Apple Intelligence feature, is not available to use in Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, and Messenger.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960221" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-writing-tools.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
Apple's Writing Tools include options to proofread, rewrite, and summarize text almost anywhere you can type in iOS 18. A long press in a text input field usually brings up the feature, but not in any of Meta's apps currently. 
<br/>
<br/>
Brazilian blog <em><a href="https://sorcererhat.tech/articles/meta-impede-o-uso-da-apple-intelligence-em-seus-apps">Sorcererhat Tech</a></em> spotted the lack of Writing Tools across Meta's apps, which appears to have been the case since late last year. Developers can choose whether to allow the tools in their apps, so it looks as if Meta has declined the offer.

            xAI has <a href="https://x.com/grok/status/1912670182012801156">rolled out</a> a new memory feature for Grok, its conversational AI, making the chatbot smarter and more personalized over time.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iPhone 18 models will adopt TSMC's 2nm manufacturing process for the next-generation A20 chip, which will bring substantial performance and power efficiency improvements to next year's iPhones, but it may also incur significantly more costs that Apple could pass onto the customer.
