            Apple's new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTag</a> introduces a series of small improvements, so how does it compare to the original model from 2021?

<br/>
The second-generation ‌AirTag‌ arrives five years after the original, bringing improvements to tracking range, speaker output, and internal design while retaining the same outward design and accessory compatibility. At the same time, first-generation AirTags remain available from some retailers at reduced prices, raising the question of whether the newer model is worth choosing over the original, or whether the earlier ‌AirTag‌ still makes sense as a lower-cost option.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Following a quiet start to 2026, the final week of January has been a busy one for Apple so far. There are new versions of the AirTag and the Black Unity band for the Apple Watch, and the Apple Creator Studio bundle is now available.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Apple also released iOS 26.2.1 and watchOS 26.2.1 updates, and iOS 26.3 beta testing continues.
<br/>
<br/>
While the launch of Apple Creator Studio would have been a fitting opportunity for Apple to unveil new MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips, unfortunately it looks like that proved to be nothing more than wishful thinking.

            Lockdown Mode is an optional security feature designed by Apple to provide maximum protection against highly sophisticated digital threats. When enabled on your Apple device, it greatly reduces exposure to complex attacks by restricting certain features and network connections. Keep reading to learn how to use it across iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple this week got sued in a New Jersey Federal court by the maker of mobile video app Camo, alleging Apple stole its technology when the company integrated its Continuity Camera feature into iOS 16 in 2022.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-848371" height="1276" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/continuity-camera.jpg" width="1930"/>
<br/>
Released by London-based Reincubate in 2020, the Camo app enables iPhone and Android smartphones to be used as webcams for desktop-based video calls. 
<br/>
<br/>
Apple's Continuity Camera serves a similar function within its own ecosystem, allowing an iPhone to be used as a wireless webcam with a nearby Mac that is signed into the same Apple Account.
<br/>
<br/>
Reincubate said the tech giant copied patented features from its Camo app and incorporated them into its mobile operating system in order to "redirect user demand to Apple's own platform-tied offering."

            Apple has released a carrier settings update for Telstra customers in Australia that resolves the issue affecting iPhones running iOS 16.7.13, which was released and then made unavailable to download by Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/28/apple-stops-signing-newly-released-ios-updates/">earlier this week</a>.

<br/>
The fix is delivered via a carrier bundle update, which adjusts network-related settings such as connectivity and calling features, without requiring an iOS update.

Affected users who updated to iOS 16.7.13 before Apple stopped signing it can install the bundle on their iPhone by going to Settings ➝ General ➝ About, where a prompt to update carrier settings should appear.

            Apple has signed a deal with popular fantasy author Brandon Sanderson for film and TV rights to Sanderson's "Cosmere" universe, according to <em><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/brandon-sandersons-mistborn-stormlight-archive-movie-tv-1236487271/">The Hollywood Reporter</a></em>.

<br/>
Sanderson has a large body of work, but some of his most popular fantasy books could be adapted first. Mistborn could be turned into a movie series, while The Stormlight Archive is being considered for television. Mistborn is a book series that's split into two eras, with the first three books featuring a group of magic-using metal manipulators or "Allomancers" overthrowing a dystopian empire. The second set of books follows the exploits of Wax and Wayne, two lawmen with magical abilities in a more modern setting.

are performance-related, rather than functionality-related.  I took many questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>some pointed out that extensions supply much of this missing functionality
  </li><li>some supported the lack of features because the features are either unnecessary or harmful

<blockquote>
<p>AI is still stuck in “efficiency mode.” In many organizations, a technology organization leads AI efforts and is treated as a cost center. Those CIOs are incentivized to optimize for efficiency, not growth. The result is predictable: Tech-led AI strategies deliver productivity improvements, but not transformation. Equally concerning is that technology and AI executives tell us their business partners can’t articulate what they want from AI beyond saving money. That leadership gap bleeds over into the measurement of AI value.</p>
<p>While most agree that AI boosts productivity, only 13% report positive EBITDA impact, and fewer than a third link AI contributions to P&amp;L. Without financial accountability, AI becomes an endless pilot treadmill — producin</p></blockquote> [...]<br>

<p>A Gartner survey of 377 U.S. consumers, conducted in June and July 2025, revealed that rather than shortcutting decisions, AI features are lengthening the research journey. Thirty-one percent of consumers surveyed say AI summaries cause them to spend more time searching for information, compared to just 16% who spend less. Over two-thirds continue past Google’s AI Overview, signaling that summaries are not the final answer. When researching purchases, 31% of consumers consider more product options due to AI overviews, versus only 7% who consider fewer.</p>

<p>Now, I’m sure that at least some of you are shaking your heads and thinking, I’m saying we have to all build our own PaaS. Haven’t we been there before with platforms as a service? But I am absolutely not suggesting that we walk up to Sisyphus, give a big high five and go, “Let’s grab that boulder and push it up the hill of our internal platform as a service.” It’s not about rebuilding what we can purchase that is available on the market. It’s about making sure we spend our time building the things that are bespoke and important for our organization. It’s so we can depend on platforms like these products and more to build on top of because an internal platform is bespoke to your business. It is always striving to fill the space between what you can buy from the market and what your teams demand to be effective. Said</p></blockquote> [...]<br>
