            Apple's online store is now down ahead of today's WWDC keynote at 10 a.m. Pacific Time. In addition to previewing its rumored AR/VR headset, Apple is expected to announce a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/01/gurman-15-inch-macbook-air-wwdc/">15-inch MacBook Air</a> and potentially <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/02/new-mac-studio-likely-to-be-introduced-at-wwdc/">updated Mac Studio models</a>.

Apple routinely takes down its online store prior to launching new hardware, a move that helps to build anticipation. In this case, the store going down is likely primarily related to new Macs, as investment firm Morgan Stanley recently estimated that Apple's headset is still <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/02/apple-headset-october-production-report/">months away from entering mass production</a> and [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            You may be wondering, "How do I retrieve data from a resource that has long been closed or some of the data from it has been deleted?" I had the same question a long time ago, that's when I fully discovered the capabilities of Web Archives and created a web archive extraction tool based on Common Crawl.

Recently I had to solve a similar problem, but Common Crawl seems to be barely breathing due to overload... So I decided to reinvent the wheel and improve my tool by extending it with a Wayback Machine archives source. While developing it, I accidentally got certified by the CIA. Now my altruistic self wants to show everyone how to get such a cool thing on their virtual shelf!

For those who are interested in the "behind the scenes" details, I also described what the two aforementioned services have in common and how we can use them through the API. At the end, we will get the certificate using the GoGetCraw tool.<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Starting with iOS 17, the Wallet app on iPhone may be able to show balances for a wider range of credit cards set up with Apple Pay, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-02/apple-wwdc-2023-mixed-reality-headset-ios-17-and-other-products-to-expect">report today from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

<br/>
"The Wallet app will get an upgrade as the company pushes deeper into financial services," wrote Gurman. "That could include the app tying deeper into third-party credit cards to show balance information, mirroring the experience of the Apple Card."
<br/>
<br/>
Like many other financial-related features, it is possible that the expanded credit card balance feature would only be available in the U.S. at launch.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            "Stray," an adventure game that lets players take on the role of a cat, will soon be available on the Mac. Introduced in 2022, Stray has previously been limited to Windows machines and PlayStation consoles.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br/>
In Stray, a stray cat finds himself stuck in a walled city filled with robots and mutant bacteria. The cat must make his way back up to the surface with the help of B-12, his drone companion.
<br/>
<br/>
Stray offers third-person gameplay and it requires players to solve puzzles, bypass obstacles, and complete quests while avoiding monsters like Zurks (evil bacteria) and Sentinels (security bots). Much of the game is platform-based, involving climbing up various obstacles and interacting with the environment to open up new pathways. There are cat behaviors too, of course, such as sneaking, sleeping, meowing, and nuzzling up to NPCs to get pets.

On the Mac, Stray will take advantage of MetalFX Upscaling for accelerated graphics performa [...]<br>
