            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-11 08:55:10-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, Apple is introducing a deceptively simple feature that could transform your morning routine: customizable alarm snooze intervals.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005678" height="3078" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/alarm-snooze-duration-ios-26.jpg" width="5472"/>
<br/>
The update allows users to set snooze duration anywhere from 1 to 15 minutes, finally breaking free from the rigid 9-minute default that has frustrated iPhone users for years. You can access the feature by tapping any alarm and tapping the number next to "Snooze Duration" in the options.
<br/>
<br/>
While it might sound trivial, the change nixes a long-lingering frustration. Some people need just a quick 2-minute buffer before rising from their slumber, while others prefer a longer window to properly wake up. The fixed 9-minute interval – a holdover from mechanical alarm clock limitations – never made sense in the smartphone era.
<br/>
<br/>
It's the kind of quality-of- [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-11 08:16:41-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/04/music-lock-screen-widget-animated-artwork-ios-26/">rumor</a> was true: iOS 26 introduces an option to view full-screen animated album art on the iPhone's Lock Screen for certain Apple Music songs.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005668" height="896" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/iOS-26-Lock-Screen-Full-Screen-Album-Art.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
To enter the full-screen mode, simply tap on the album art in the Lock Screen's music player for the song that is currently playing, and the artwork will expand and become animated, which contributes to a more immersive listening experience.
<br/>
<br/>
Animated album art was already visible in the Apple Music app for many popular songs, and now it has come to the Lock Screen for the first time.
<br/>
<br/>
Not all songs have animated artwork, but the selection is growing.

<br/>
iOS 18 introduced Dark and Tinted options for iPhone app icons, and macOS Tahoe extends those options to the Mac for the first time.

Just like on iOS 26, macOS Tahoe also offers a Clear option for app icons, which pairs nicely with the new Liquid Glass design.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple at WWDC previewed a bunch of new features coming in its updated operating systems, but certain changes will have been met with dismay by third-party developers who already offer apps with equivalent or similar features. In other words, their product has been "sherlocked" by Apple. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005210" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/apple-beta-26-lineup.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
When Apple creates an app or a feature that has functionality found in a third-party app, it is referred to as sherlocking. The name dates back to a "Sherlock" search tool in OS X that Apple enhanced with features that were cribbed from a third-party app called Watson. Watson's developers accused Apple of copying the product without compensation, and from then on, sherlocking has been used to describe apps that are supplanted by Apple.

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-06-11 04:36:42-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has released a unique haptic trailer for its upcoming "F1" movie starring Brad Pitt, available exclusively in the TV app on iPhone.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005574" height="3030" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/f1-trailer-haptic.jpeg" width="5386"/>
<br/>
The trailer uses the iPhone's Taptic Engine to create vibrations that sync with the on-screen action. When F1 cars roar around the track, you can physically feel the engine vibrations in your hands. The haptic effects match the intensity of what's happening on screen, ramping up as engines rev and providing subtle feedback for smaller actions like a bouncing ping pong ball.
<br/>
<br/>
To experience the trailer, iPhone users need iOS 18.4 or later and can find it featured in the TV+ tab of the TV app.
<br/>
<br/>
In the film, Brad Pitt stars as an F1 driver who was an up-and-coming talent in the 1990s, until an accident on the track nearly ended his career. Thirty years later, Pitt  [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iPadOS 26, Apple is introducing major changes to the way that multitasking works, and part of that update will see the removal of Split View and Slide Over, two multitasking interface options that have long existed on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.

<br/>
iPadOS 26 allows for multiple app windows, each of which can be resized freely on the display. The feature works on all ‌iPad‌ models able to run iPadOS 26, though there are limitations on how many apps can be open at once. On older iPads, for example, you're limited to four apps. Newer iPads can have more open app windows.

            Apple <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/1l854fa/toy_story_and_other_faces_are_removed_in_26/">has removed</a> several Apple Watch faces that are options in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a>, nixing the Fire/Water, Gradient, Liquid Metal, Vapor, and Toy Story watch faces, according to a post on Reddit.

<br/>
Apple tends to quietly remove some watch face options when it launches a new version of iOS, so it is not a huge surprise to see these go missing. It is not clear why Apple picked these watch faces in particular, but it could be because they were used less often.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple didn't add new watch faces with watchOS 26, but some watch faces have new Liquid Glass-inspired design options.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com</div> [...]<br>

            This article was originally published in 2018, yet its core insights into Go’s garbage collection model remain highly relevant for developers today. While some implementation details of Go’s runtime have evolved, the foundational concepts explored here—such as the semantics of the tri-color mark and sweep algorithm, Stop The World (STW) events, and GC trace interpretation—are still essential to understanding how Go manages memory. Whether you&rsquo;re optimizing performance or deepening your knowledge of Go internals, this post continues to offer a clear and practical guide to working with the garbage collector, not against it.<br>
