            <b>Published:</b> 2023-12-19 11:48:15-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today introduced a new firmware update for the third-generation AirPods. The new firmware is version 6A317, up from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-releases-new-airpods-firmware-2/">6A300 firmware</a> introduced in September.

<br/>
Apple's AirPods firmware updates do not come with details on new features, so it is unclear what might be included in the software.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple also does not offer instructions on how to upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ are connected to an iOS device. Putting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ in the case, connecting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to a power source, and then pairing the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to an iOS device or Mac should force the update.

            In macOS Sonoma 14.2, Apple included some additional controls for Shazam music recognition, which is now baked into the Mac operating system more than ever. Here's how to add the functionality to your Mac's menu bar and Control Center.

<br/>
For those unfamiliar with Shazam, it's an Apple-owned popular service that can identify the names and lyrics of songs, music videos, TV shows, and more, simply by listening to and deciphering whatever is playing. 
<br/>
<br/>
After years of ‌‌Siri‌‌ integration, Apple acquired Shazam in 2018, and integrated it into iOS and iPadOS as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-shazam-without-downloading-app/">system-level song recognition function</a>. With macOS 14.2, the same level of integration has finally come to Mac.
