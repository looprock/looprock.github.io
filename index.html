            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Samsung is developing a slim version of its upcoming flagship Galaxy S25 smartphone that could launch in Q2 2025, potentially setting up a direct competition with Apple's rumored iPhone 17 'Air', according to reports from South Korean media and data discovered in GSMA's global mobile registry database.

<br/>
Korea's <em><a href="https://www.etnews.com/20241031000259">ET News</a></em> on October 31 claimed that Samsung could release a slim smartphone during the second quarter of 2025, or between April and June. The timing would position it just a few months ahead of the launch of Apple's so-called <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/iphone-17-slim-everything-we-know/">iPhone 17 'Air'</a>, expected in September 2025.

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-11-07 02:39:54-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's plans to release a MacBook Air with an OLED display may face significant delays beyond its original expected 2027 launch window, according to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=31036">The Elec</a></em>.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Industry sources cited by the Korean outlet point to pricing concerns and supply chain challenges as key factors behind the potential delay. The high manufacturing costs associated with OLED displays would substantially increase the MacBook Air's retail price, which risks making it less attractive to consumers.

The MacBook Air is often regarded as the company's most popular Mac model. According to <a href="https://canalys.com/newsroom/us-pc-market-q1-2024">Canalys</a>, Apple's US Mac market share grew by 22% in the first quarter of 2024, a surge that was likely [...]<br>

            With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.2 beta, Apple has revamped <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a>, adding new options for sharing a more limited amount of information on the screen when AirPlaying to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>.

<br/>
There are now options to show your entire screen, a specific window or app, or your extended display. Limiting ‌AirPlay‌ to a specific app allows a presentation or photos to be shared on the larger screen of a TV without allowing viewers to see all of the content on a Mac.
<br/>
<br/>
In the current version of macOS, Apple allows for mirroring a Mac's display to an ‌Apple TV‌, but there is no option for sharing just a portion of a display.

The investigation centers on concerns that US-based Corning may have abused its market position by adopting exclusivity contracts to prevent rival glass makers from competing for business with mobile device manufacturers.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple and Masimo are back in a California court this week for a bench trial that will see Masimo arguing that Apple illegally poached its employees and stole trade secrets when developing the Apple Watch.

<br/>
Masimo first filed the trade secret lawsuit against Apple in 2020, and there was a jury trial in April 2023. During that trial, the court threw out more than half of Masimo's trade secret claims, but the judge ultimately declared a mistrial because the jury was not able to come to a final decision. Six of seven jurors sided with Apple, while one Masimo holdout would not change her opinion.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple and Masimo were slated to retry the case with another jury, but Masimo abandoned all claims asking for monetary compensation in order to get a bench trial instead. Masimo originally requested $1.85 billion in da [...]<br>

            The first developer beta of visionOS 2.2 came out yesterday, and it includes a much anticipated new feature for Vision Pro users. When using the Vision Pro as a display for a Mac, there are now options to use wide and ultrawide layouts in addition to the standard virtual display.

<div class="center-wrap"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>

We thought we'd check out the new display settings for those who might be interested in seeing how this changes the Vision Pro Mac workflow.
<br/>
<br/>
With the wide display option, there's enough screen real estate to use four apps at once without compromising on window size. Ultrawide bumps up the available space even more, and it's almost too much display space.

Using the ultrawide setting is like having multiple curved Mac displays in front of you to handle your Mac apps, and then you can also add in visionOS apps to bet [...]<br>

In that post, I argued in the affirmative, but also said that it's probably shouldn't be your primary backup mechanism. For that, you probably shouldn't directly use anything that is included in PostgreSQL itself, but rather a well-maintained third-party backup tool such as <a href="https://pgbarman.org/" target="_blank">barman</a> or <a href="https://pgbackrest.org/" target="_blank">pgbackrest</a>.
