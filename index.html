Apple's AirPods firmware updates often do not come with details on new features, so it is unclear what might be included in the software.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has pivoted to simpler, less ambitious design for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/">Apple Car</a> in order to actually bring the vehicle to market, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-23/apple-car-ev-set-to-debut-in-2028-with-limited-autonomous-driving">Bloomberg</a></em>. Apple initially wanted a driverless car with full autonomous capabilities, but it is now developing an electric vehicle with fewer features.

<br/>
After abandoning the driverless plans, Apple aimed for a car with Level 4 autonomous functionality that would have allowed the car's system to take over driving in limited circumstances such as on highways, but even that was too ambitious.

<p id="5XICq6">Google’s Chrome browser is leaning into AI in a big way. Rather than just shove a Bard sidebar into the browser, Google is rolling out a couple of features that tap into its models in order to hopefully make your browser a little more pleasant to use. They’re launching today in an experimental mode (you can go to settings and turn on “Experimental AI” to get them), and <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/google-chrome-generative-ai-features-january-2024/">Google says they’re just the beginning</a> of the AI browser takeover.</p>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-01-23 09:00:00-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Google today announced plans to add experimental generative AI features to the latest version of Chrome for Mac (M121), helping users organize tabs, create themes, and draft content.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932250" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/chrome-generative-ai.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
The Tab Organizer is able to suggest and create tab groups based on the tabs that are open, an option that can be accessed by right-clicking on a tab and choosing the Organize Similar Tabs option.
<br/>
<br/>
With a text-to-image diffusion model, Chrome users can generate custom themes based on a subject, mood, visual style, and color. The "Create with AI" theme option is available under the Customize Chrome side panel.
<br/>
<br/>
When writing something on the web, such as on a forum, Chrome will be able to help users generate content. The feature will let users right-click in any text box or field to access a "Help me write" option.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            January 24 marks the 40th anniversary of Steve Jobs unveiling the Macintosh, the first successful mass-marketed computer with a graphical user interface.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932454" height="1265" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Classic-Mac-40-Years-Old-Feature-1.jpg" width="2250"/>
<br/>
The original Macintosh popularized the computer mouse, allowing users to control an on-screen pointer. This point-and-click method of computer navigation was still a novel concept to most people at the time, as personal computers in this era typically had text-based command-line interfaces controlled with a keyboard.
<br/>
<br/>
An excerpt from <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/dept/SUL/sites/mac/primary/docs/pr1.html">Apple's press release</a> in 1984:<blockquote>Users tell Macintosh what to do simply by moving a "mouse" — a small pointing device — to select among functions listed in menus and represented by pictorial symbols on the screen.

            Apple has until March 6 to fully comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act, which among other things will require the company to allow iPhone users to install apps outside of the App Store. With the deadline for this regulation fast approaching, it is likely that Apple will begin preparing for these changes with iOS 17.4.

<br/>
The first iOS 17.4 beta is expected to be released as early as this week, although it is unclear if the app-related changes will be rolled out for testing immediately, or held for later beta versions.

The efforts are part of the company's wider push to offer more health capabilities, embodied by the recent announcement of the Galaxy Ring, which touts activity and sleep tracking, with more health features set to arrive later.

<br/>
The updates fix a bug in WebKit that could allow maliciously crafted content to lead to arbitrary code execution. Apple says on its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214059">security support page</a> that it is aware of a report that the issue may have been exploited.
<br/>
<br/>
Apple's software releases also address several other security vulnerabilities that were not known to have been used in the wild. iOS 17.3, for example, fixes bugs with the Neural Engine, kernel, Mail, Safari, Shortcuts, and more.

Are you at least upgrading your existing tools to get new functionality? If you’re not, there’s a good chance you’re not going to actually change. Worse, if management is avoiding changing and adding budget for new tools, you’re also likely not going to change.</p><p></p> [...]<br>
