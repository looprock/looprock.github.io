            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's Mac mini has long been a powerhouse in a compact form, offering impressive performance in a small package. With rumors swirling about a completely overhauled new model that is likely just days away from being announced, anticipation is building for what Apple has in store. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961276" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/M4-Mac-mini-Silver-Perspective.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
From enhanced connectivity to major hardware upgrades, the upcoming Mac mini promises to bring significant improvements that make it more compelling than ever. Here are five reasons to get excited about the next generation of this beloved small form-factor desktop. 
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Major Redesign</h2>
<br/>
Apple is planning to debut completely redesigned Mac mini models, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/mac-mini-to-become-smallest-ever-apple-computer/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. The new ‌Mac mi [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-10-23 06:11:37-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple has abruptly reduced production of the Vision Pro headset and could stop making the current version of the device completely by the end of 2024, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-sharply-scales-back-production-of-vision-pro"><em>The Information</em></a> reports.

<br/>
Citing multiple people "directly involved" in making components for the headset, the report says that the scaling back of production began in the early summer. This indicates that Apple now has a sufficient number of Vision Pro units in its inventory to meet demand for the device's remaining lifespan through to next year.
<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro is widely reported to have seen weak demand due to insufficient content and its high price point. <em>The Information</em> says that Vision Pro suppliers have now produced enough components [...]<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2024-10-23 03:29:00-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 18, Apple includes a new over-the-air recovery feature designed to revive bricked iPhone 16 devices using another iPhone or an iPad, and it appears that the same feature can be used to recover the new iPad mini 7, too.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
In iOS 18, placing an iPhone 16 next to another iPhone or iPad can start an over-the-air firmware recovery – the other device downloads a new iOS firmware and transfers it to the bricked device, removing the need to connect it to a computer. ‌This contrasts with iPhone 15 and earlier models, which require connection to a Mac or PC to restore the firmware.

<br/>
"This is a big lift," Federighi told <em>WSJ</em>'s Joanna Stern, explaining Apple's cautious strategy of integrating AI into its devices.

The initial release will focus on basic features including Writing Tools for text summarization, notification summaries, and a C [...]<br>
