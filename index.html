            A jury for the U.S. District Court for Western Texas on Friday found that the Secure Enclave built into modern Apple devices does not infringe four user verification patents owned by the company "Identity Security LLC," according to <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/apple-defeats-patent-infringement-lawsuit-over-iphone-security">Bloomberg Law</a>.

Apple introduced the Secure Enclave in 2013 in the iPhone 5s, the first iPhone with Touch ID, and it is now used in all iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, Apple Watch, and HomePod models.
