            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple plans to release a next-generation Studio Display or equivalent replacement external monitor as soon as early next year, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-10/apple-plans-new-macbook-pro-iphone-17e-and-ipads-by-early-2026"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.

<br/>
In his latest report on Apple's product roadmap for 2026, Gurman said the company is planning to launch its first new Mac external monitor since debuting the Apple Studio Display in 2022. 
<br/>
<br/>
The new version, internally code-named J427, "is currently slated for early 2026," alongside Macs with M5 chips, said Gurman.
<br/>
<br/>
Gurman in February <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/16/new-studio-display-per-mark-gurman/">reported</a> that Apple was "ramping up" work on a new Studio Display that "sho [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple in October 2024 overhauled its 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, adding M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips, Thunderbolt 5 ports on higher-end models, display changes, and more. That's quite a lot of updates in one go, but there is another major refresh coming to the MacBook Pro – although when it will arrive has now been thrown into doubt.

<br/>
According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/10/no-m5-macbook-pro-2025/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, Apple is rethinking its original plan to minimally refresh the MacBook Pro lineup with M5 chips later this year. Instead, the refreshed M5 models, offering only a small performance boost, are now expected to arrive in the first half of 2026.

            Apple will launch a new 12th generation entry-level iPad in the spring of next year, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-10/apple-plans-new-macbook-pro-iphone-17e-and-ipads-by-early-2026">Bloomberg</a></em>'s Mark Gurman.

<br/>
Apple is said to have two versions of the entry-level 11-inch iPad in development, codenamed J581 and J582. These could refer to different storage capacities – in which case, Apple may be planning to drop the existing lowest capacity option. The current iPad 11 is available in 128, 256, and 512GB capacities.
<br/>
<br/>
Based on the report, the next-generation low-end iPad model will look like the current version but include a faster chip, but there is no word yet on which chip it will use. The iPad 11 features an A16 processor.

            Apple is expected to introduce several notable hardware upgrades with the iPhone 17 lineup in 2025, and one of the most significant changes involves RAM. While all four iPhone 16 models feature 8GB of RAM, recent supply chain reports suggest that Apple plans to increase memory in several iPhone 17 models, potentially improving multitasking and gaming performance, as well as future-proofing the devices for upcoming Apple Intelligence and machine learning features.

<br/>
The research paper, titled "<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00191v1">Beyond Sensor Data: Foundation Models of Behavioral Data from Wearables Improve Health Predictions</a>," introduces a machine learning model that analyzes user behavior to flag potential health issues.

I was able to test the Doorbell Camera Hub G410 ahead of launch, and it's a solid doorbell camera, and even better if you have an Aqara setup or plan to get more Aqara products.

For Thread-based devices, it's also a Thread border router that can improve connectivity.
