            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, Apple yesterday debuted a new version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2 with a USB-C charging case. The swap to USB-C instead of Lightning is the primary new feature, but Apple also updated audio quality in a way that may upset some of its customers.

<br/>
First, it is now possible to sign into an Apple ID with any phone number or secondary email address on file with the account. We were able to sign into an Apple ID with a phone number on the Apple ID website using a Mac running macOS Ventura, so it's unclear if this feature specifically requires the new software updates or is simply a backend change.

During yesterday's event, Apple said that the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ could record up to ProRes 4K at 60 fps to external storage thanks to the new USB-C port.

mmWave is a set of 5G frequencies that promise ultra-fast speeds at short distances, which is ideal for dense urban areas. By comparison, sub-6GHz 5G is generally slower than mmWave, but the signals travel further, better serving suburban and rural areas. All four iPhone 15 models support sub-6GHz 5G outside of the U.S., and sub-6GHz networks are still more common than mmWave networks in countries that have rolled out 5G.

            <b>Published:</b> 2023-09-13 11:52:59+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In the digital age, product managers should harness the psychology of habit-forming products to ensure user retention. Central to this is habit loops, which consist of a cue, routine, and reward. Effective digital products integrate into users' daily routines, leading to increased engagement, monetization opportunities, organic growth, and competitive advantage. Habit loops directly impact user retention, making users less likely to churn and more likely to become loyal advocates. A case study on Duolingo showcases how the app uses habit loops to drive engagement. Product managers can use Habit Testing to create habit-forming products, which involves identifying habitual users, codifying the habit path, and iterating based on feedback. However, it's crucial to be mindful of the potential negative impacts of habit-forming products and prioritize user well-being.<br>
