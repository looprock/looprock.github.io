            Reddit CEO’s insistence that the protests from Reddit would simply “pass” certainly hasn’t come to pass just yet. While increasing pressure from the company against protest mods has resulted in some backing down, many are continuing to engage in malicious compliance, making it clear they’re still protesting.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Meta today started rolling out a highly-requested "Following" tab in its <a href="https://apps.applca/app/threads-an-instagram-app/id6446901002">Threads</a> app, allowing users to view posts from accounts they follow in reverse-chronological order. The app continues to show algorithmically recommended posts under the "For you" tab.

<br/>
The addition of a "Following" tab brings Threads more in line with its rival Twitter, and it will make the app more useful for keeping track of the latest posts in real time. The new tab is still in the process of rolling out as a server-side change, so it is not yet visible to all users, but updating the app and tapping the home button in the bottom menu might help.

<p id="OlqdRN">One of Instagram Threads’ most requested features is finally here: the Following tab that lets you see only the people you, er, follow. “Ask and you shall receive,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said <a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/CvH_gG3rwf3?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D">in a post on Threads</a> quoting a user asking for the feature.</p>

            Apple is considering releasing a foldable iPad in the future, according to a paywalled <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/newregister/join.asp?view=snapshots&amp;#s3">preview of an upcoming <em>DigiTimes</em> report</a> shared today.

"Apple, who is rumored to have been working on foldable smartphones for several years, reportedly is considering extending the effort to the tablet sector," the preview says, citing sources from the upstream supply chain.

            Language learning technology&#8217;s (aka &#8220;AI&#8221;) introduction into journalism has been a blistering mess.

<p id="uBPb3Z">Wayfair has launched a free “virtual room restyler” called <a href="https://www.wayfairnext.com/decorify">Decorify</a>. It employs generative AI to show you a redecorated version of the room you want to zhuzh after you upload a picture of it and choose the visual style you want. Then, if you like what you see, you can pick from a grid of furniture recommendations presented to the right of your AI-remodeled room.</p>

            Apple has become the target of a £785 million ($1 billion) class action lawsuit on behalf of over 1,500 developers in the UK over its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> fees, reports <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/24/apple-targeted-in-app-store-antitrust-damages-suit-thats-seeking-1bn-for-uk-developers/">TechCrunch</a></em>.

<br/>
The suit accuses Apple of abusing a dominant position by charging a 15% to 30% fee on in-app sales in the ‌App Store‌, a policy that has been criticized by antitrust regulators in other countries. 
<br/>
<br/>
It also argues UK consumers are missing out because developers are being deprived of money that could be spent on research and development to help drive app innovation.

            At Yelp, Apache Spark and JupyterHub are heavily used for batch processing and interactive use-cases, such as in building feature models, conducting ad-hoc data analysis, sharing templates, making on-boarding materials, creating visualizations, and producing sales reports. Our initial deployments of Jupyter at Yelp were iPython notebooks managed at an individual level. Later on when Jupyterlab was released (2018), our notebook ecosystem was extended to Jupyter Servers running on dev boxes, which was managed by individual engineering teams. Over time with growing use-cases and data-flow, this introduced unnecessary version variability, became error-prone due to the number of manual steps, caused config...<br>
