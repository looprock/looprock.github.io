            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's long-rumored foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> may cost less to manufacture than previously expected thanks to major reductions in hinge component pricing, according to analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.

<br/>
In a <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/mnbyfW1xgQZ5ia">new report</a>, Kuo said that the hinge designed for Apple's foldable ‌iPhone‌ is expected to carry an average selling price (ASP) of approximately $70 to $80 when mass production begins, well below the market expectation of $100 to $120 or higher. Kuo attributed the cost decline not to cheaper materials, but to "assembly design optimization" and Foxconn's influence in production scaling.
