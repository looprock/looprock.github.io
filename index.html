The book-style foldable will reportedly feature an industry-first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/07/iphone-fold-24mp-under-display-camera/">24-megapixel under-display camera</a> built into the inner display, according to a recent JP Morgan equity research report.

If the leak is accurate, the quality bump suggests Apple has achieved a breakthrough in light transmittance and image clarity that has eluded other manufacturers.

            Spotify will raise subscription prices for users in the United States in the first quarter of next year, according to the <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fb490480-5d9a-495f-8c23-f34149bbcadb">Financial Times</a></em>, citing sources familiar with the matter.

<br/>
The report links pressure from major record labels on both Spotify and Apple Music to raise subscription prices. They argue prices have lagged inflation, while subscriptions remain cheap compared to video services such as Netflix.
<br/>
<br/>
Wall Street analysts say the price increase is critical to Spotify's stock, as the company pushes to show profitability. JPMorgan analysts have projected a $1-a-month price rise would boost Spotify's annual revenue by $500 million.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Huawei's just-announced <a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/cn/phones/">Mate 80 lineup</a> is attracting attention in China today thanks to a display spec that easily sees off the competition in the premium smartphone segment.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028097" height="2160" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/8000-nits-huawei-mate-80@2x.jpg" width="3840"/>
<br/>
The company claims the OLED panels in its latest phones can reach up to 8,000 nits of peak brightness – a figure that, if independently verified, would make the Mate 80 series the brightest smartphones on the market.
<br/>
<br/>
Huawei says all four models – the Mate 80, Mate 80 Pro, Mate 80 Pro Max, and Mate 80 RS – achieve unmatched peak output, but the Pro Max uses a dual-layer OLED design to push 8,000 nits brightness, with superior efficiency and better thermal handling.

The claim positions Huawei well ahead of Apple's latest iPhone 17 models, which top out at 3,000 ni [...]<br>

            Encrypted messaging platform Signal now offers <a href="https://x.com/signalapp/status/1993018186690871409">secure backups on iPhone</a>, letting users save and restore messages if they lose access to their device.

<br/>
There are free and paid versions of Signal's secure backups. The free version lets users store up to 100MB of text messages, including photos, videos, and files from the last 45 days.
<br/>
<br/>
The paid version costs $1.99 per month and can back up all text messages, along with up to 100GB of media which can be older than 45 days. 
<br/>
<br/>
The end-to-end encrypted backups can be accessed using a 64-character recovery key generated by the user's device, but keeping the key safe is crucial – if it's lost, Signal can't help users recover their backups.

            Last week&#8217;s dismissal of the FTC&#8217;s antitrust case against Meta—combined with the earlier limited remedies in the Google search case—demonstrates something that should be obvious by now: antitrust is a pathetically weak tool for increasing competition in digital markets. This isn&#8217;t an argument against competition. Competition in digital markets matters, desperately. But antitrust enforcement is [&#8230;]<br>

Citing supply chain sources, <em>UDN</em> says that Apple has solved "the crease problem" that has plagued most foldable smartphones, and the foldable ‌iPhone‌ will be the first crease-free foldable smartphone on the market. We've heard multiple prior rumors about Apple's intensive work on the hinge and display to minimize creasing, so this isn't the first time the foldable ‌iPhone‌ has been rumored to have a seamless screen.

<p>There is a lot that rings true about this suggestion. Consider the following intuitive, common sense ideas: if we let immigrants come here and work, they’ll take our jobs; we should levy taxes on imports to help protect our economy from foreign competition; crime can only be controlled by getting tough on criminals. These ideas may be true or false, but the point is that they all have populist appeal, and they all seem kind of obvious.</p>
<p>The elite consensus is that these ideas are also wrong. But to reach that conclusion requires considerable time and effort to sift through the evidence or work through the theory.
