            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple launched the original <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> 20 years ago today, kickstarting a trend of small but powerful computers.

<br/>
The ‌Mac mini‌ was originally designed as a gateway for users to enter the Apple ecosystem without the expense associated with the company's higher-end offerings of the time, such as the Power Mac G5 and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> G5, and costly peripherals. Apple's then-CEO Steve Jobs described the ‌Mac mini‌ as "the most affordable Mac ever" during its unveiling at Macworld Expo 2005, noting that its $499 starting price was intended to appeal to PC users looking to switch to the Mac platform. Today's base model ‌Mac mini‌ with the M4 chip costs just $599.

            <p>People continue to tell me on a semi-regular basis how much they appreciate these approximately annual posts, the first of which came out in April of 2017. I think this might be more because the project doesn't have enough official ways to recognize people than it is an endorsement of the particular thing that I've done here, the limitations of which I am always careful to mention. In particular, I do not intend this as a comprehensive picture of contributions to the project, or even to development activity; and I lack the data to fairly divide credit for a single commit between multiple individuals. Nevertheless, I am very grateful to all the people who have expressed appreciation for these posts, or told me about the value that they derived from them. Thank you so much.</p><p>Without further ado, let's see this year's numbers. I calculate that, in 2024, there were 229 people who were the principal author of at least one PostgreSQL commit. 66% of the new lines of code were contributed by one of 18 people,</p> [...]<br>

            Well, that didn&#8217;t take long. A short-lived win for civil liberties and the Free Speech Coalition has been undone by the Sixth Circuit Appeals court. The reasoning behind the roll back of the injunction are questionable, to say the least. The Free Speech Coalition&#8217;s case against Tennessee&#8217;s age verification law was solid.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple's iconic "1984" commercial, which introduced the Macintosh computer to the world, aired 41 years ago today during Super Bowl XVIII.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-986454" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/1984-ad.jpg" width="1600"/>
<br/>
Directed by Ridley Scott, the advertisement was designed to highlight the Macintosh as a groundbreaking computer that offers freedom and individuality in a market dominated by corporate conformity. It drew inspiration from George Orwell's dystopian novel <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>, with Apple positioning itself as a liberator from the homogenized control represented by the fictional "Big Brother," a veiled allegory for IBM.
<br/>
<br/>
The ad concludes with the voiceover stating, "On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you'll see why 1984 won't be like '1984.'"

            At Yelp, we encountered challenges that prompted us to enhance the training time of our ad-revenue generating models, which use a Wide and Deep Neural Network architecture for predicting ad click-through rates (pCTR). These models handle large tabular datasets with small parameter spaces, requiring innovative data solutions. This blog post delves into our journey of optimizing training time using TensorFlow and Horovod, along with the development of ArrowStreamServer, our in-house library for low-latency data streaming and serving. Together, these components have allowed us to achieve a 1400x speedup in training for business critical models compared to using a single GPU...<br>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-01-21 15:14:17-08:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            With iOS 18.3, Apple made a small but meaningful change to the way the Calculator app works, reintroducing repeating operations. When you tap the equals sign twice, the app will now repeat the last mathematical operation.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960038" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iOS-18-Calculator-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
So, for example, if you type in 5x5 and tap the equals sign, you'll get 25 as a result. If you hit the equals sign again, it will multiply 25x5, and will continue multiplying by 5 every time you tap the equals symbol.
<br/>
<br/>
Repeating operations were an option in the Calculator app prior to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, but ‌iOS 18‌ removed the functionality. Users who have missed the feature will get it back after updating to iOS 18.3. Being able to repeat operations is useful for calculating compound interest.

The blurry, pixelated image shows a pair of rear iPhone shells with a pill-shaped, raised camera bar along the top.

The ultra-thin "iPhone 17 Air" is the only iPhone 17 model that is expected to have a single rear camera, so the shell could be for that device.
