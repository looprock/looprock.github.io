Hello everyone. Previous my articles were <a href="https://hackernoon.com/reactive-programming-in-game-development-specifics-of-unity">Reactive Programming in Game Development: Specifics of Unity</a> and <strong><a href="https://hackernoon.com/developing-games-on-unity-examining-approaches-to-organizing-architecture">Developing Games on Unity: Examining Approaches to Organizing Architecture</a>.</strong></p>
<p>\
Today I would like to touch upon such a topic as rendering and shaders in Unity. Shaders (in simple words) are instructions for video cards that tell them how to render and transform objects in the game. So, welcome to the club, buddy.</p>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>\</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>One of the main factors for successful machine learning is choosing the right graphics card that will allow you to process large amounts of data and perform parallel computations as quickly and efficiently as possible. Most machine learning tasks, especially training deep neural networks, require intensive processing of matrices and tensors. Note that TPUs, FPGAs, and specialized AI chips have been gaining popularity recently.</p>
<p>\
What graphics card characteristics are important for performing machine learning?</p>
<p>\
When choosing a graphics card for machine learning, there are a few key features to look for:</p>
<p>\</p>
<ul>
<li>Computing power: the number of cores/processors determines the parallel processing capabilities of the graphics card.</li>
<li>GPU memory: large capacity allows you to work efficiently with large data and complex models.</li>
<li>Support for specialized libraries: hardware support for libraries such as CUDA or ROCm speeds u</li></ul> [...]<br>
