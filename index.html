Opera first previewed Neon in May and is now gradually rolling out invites to waitlist members.

Neon can open and close tabs, compare information across multiple sources, and even complete transactions on a user's behalf.
<br/>
<br/>
Central to Neon's design is the Tasks feature, which creates self-contained workspaces for different projects. Each Task functions like a mini-browser with its own context, allowing the AI to act across  [...]<br>

Sleep apnea is a condition in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep, often leading to poor rest.

<br/>
The feature is supported on the Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, Series 11, Apple Watch Ultra 2, and Apple Watch Ultra 3, and is available in more than 150 countries world [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>&lsquo;JFrog Fly is the company’s agentic developer platform and an MCP server that works with multiple IDEs, including VS Code and Cursor. Integrated with GitHub and observability, Fly provides a chat interface that allows users to query, promote, and roll back existing releases based on specifics of the code (e.g., “Which features were added to this release?” or “Deploy the release that added styling to the user field”). Fly includes an audacious reimagining of the software development process, making versioning automatic and version names obsolete. This makes for a slick demo but may introduce confusion for JFrog clients who don’t want to give up their semantic versions or who need to support back-level software.&rsquo;</p>

The ‌iPad‌ runs SwitchBoard, Apple's internal factory testing software, instead of a version of iOS. It was manufactured in 2011, but it is a 2012 ‌iPad‌ that has an ‌iPad‌ 2,4 identifier. The ‌iPad‌ is a prototype that Apple used during the Engineering Validation Testing phase of device production.

The Claude apps now support code execution and file creation for making spreadsheets, slides, and documents directly in the conversation. Claude for Chrome is available as well, with Anthropic allowing some Max users to beta test the feature. There's also a Claude Agent SDK that's ava [...]<br>

The idea is to race with head movements, tilting your head left or right to steer and dodge cars. RidePods uses the motion sensors that are built into the AirPods to detect head movements.

RidePods is a hands-free game, so like an endless runner, the motorcycle propels itself while the player controls the steering and dodging oncoming traffic. The idea is to get the highest score possible.
<br/>
<br/>
To play the game, users will need earbuds with motion sensors, like the AirPods Pro, Pro 2, or Pro 3. The third-generation AirPods and later also work, as do the &lt; [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            On the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ford-ceo-jim-farley-on-china-tariffs-and-the-quest/id1011668648?i=1000729050198">latest episode of <em>The Verge</em>'s Decoder podcast</a>, released today, Ford CEO Jim Farley told guest host Joanna Stern that the automaker does not entirely like Apple's current implementation of its CarPlay Ultra software system for vehicles.
<br/>

            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-29 07:27:14-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 26, Apple quietly added a neat new option that lets you send smaller-sized previews of images over Messages so that recipients get them right away, before the full-resolution images arrive. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010437" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iOS-26-Messages-Feature-2-1.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Thanks to the new setting, your recipient will receive a lower-quality preview almost instantly, followed by the full-resolution image. And if you're traveling with limited cellular data or using a metered data connection, they only get the compressed preview version – ensuring the original high resolution image doesn't hoover up your data. 
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Enable Send Photo Previews</h2>
<br/>
Apple has made this feature easy to toggle on or off depending on your needs. Here's how to enable it:
<br/>
<ol>
<br/>
<li>Open Settings on your iPhone.</li>
