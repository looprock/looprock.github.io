            <b>Published:</b> 2025-09-15 13:35:04-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            The Apple Watch Ultra 3 replaces the second-generation model that was introduced two years ago in Apple's smartwatch lineup, but how different are the two successive smartwatch generations?
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1018080" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-vs.-Ultra-3-Feature.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
The two Apple Watch Ultra models share the overwhelming majority of their features, so should you consider buying or sticking with the second generation to save money? This breakdown serves as a way to see all the differences that the Ultra 3 brings to the table.
<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Series 11 represents <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-10-vs-series-11/">one of the smallest upgrades</a> to the mainstream model ever, while the Apple Watch Ultra 3 provides a bit bigger but still modest change compared to its predecessor.

<h1>How big the Kubernetes market?</h1><p>TAM-time for <em>managing</em> Kubernetes:</p><blockquote><p>The container management market has grown more than 20% over the past year, with a market value of over $2.5 billion in 2024. The market is forecast to exceed $4.5 billion in constant currency by 2028, with a 17.6% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-2LKN2WQC&amp;ct=250730&amp;st=sb">Gartner, August, 2025</a>.</p></blockquote><p>That TAM means that every vendor looking to sell Kubernetes is competing for slice of $3bn to $4bn pie. So, take the marketshare of Amazon, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud, IBM Red Hat, VMware, and nine other vendors that made the MQ cut. Assume that the top three have something like 30% o 40% of the market divided among them. Then the next three have 15% to 20% divided among them. And the remaining</p> [...]<br>
