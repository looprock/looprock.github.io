Writing in his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-10-20/apple-s-latest-ipad-mini-highlights-ai-advantage-sonos-considers-new-headphones-m2hkz4mn">latest Power On newsletter</a>, Gurman said that the iPhone SE is expected to gain Apple Intelligence features in March 2025, with the entry-level iPad following "later in the year." Gurman went on to suggest that nearly every Apple device with a screen will support Apple Intelligence by 2026.

The timeline indicates a significant gap since the last refresh of the entry-level iPad, which occurred in October 2022. The delayed update could be attributed to the technical  [...]<br>

            This week we're going back in time to one of our top performing shows of all time where we talk with Matt Rickard about his blog post Reflections on 10,000 Hours of Programming. These reflections are about deliberately writing code for 10,000 hours. Most don't apply to beginners. He was clear to mention that these reflections are purely about coding, not career advice or soft skills. If you count the reflections we cover on the show and be the first to comment the amount of reflections on this thread in Zulip, we'll give you a coupon code to use for a 100% free t-shirt from the merch store.
