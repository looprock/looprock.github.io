            <b>Published:</b> 2023-07-26 15:58:36+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In a recent discussion about the SEC v Ripple case, attorney and web3 legal expert Jonathan Bench provided insights into the background story. The case involves Ripple, a company that developed a token called XRP and contributed 80% of the tokens to Ripple Labs to develop software for managing international payment transactions. Bench considers the SEC's action to be consistent with its mandate of investor protection and market integrity, as XRP appears to be a security token with a centralized effort. He mentions that the Howey Test, used to determine if an investment contract is a security, lacks clear guidelines for decentralized projects like DAOs. Bench praises the Utah DAO Act as forward-looking legislation that addresses the complexities of DAOs and their interaction with the Howey Test. He also notes that the SEC's approach to regulating the crypto industry in the US has harmed the industry, leading some projects to seek offshore jurisdictions with clear regulatory frameworks.<br>

            We’ve talked a lot about just how bad the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) is. Yet some people (including people who, frankly, should know better) keep trying to tell me how well meaning it is. It’s not. It’s dangerous. But it has real momentum. A massive bipartisan group of Senators are co-sponsors of the bill. [&#8230;]<br>

The first beta <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/21/apple-releases-first-ever-visionos-beta/">came out in June</a>, so it has been available to developers to experiment with for a full month.

Because no developers have access to Vision Pro headsets at this time, testing on an actual Apple device is not possible. As of now, the SDK can be accessed through the latest Xcode beta in a virtual capacity.
