            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Understanding web application programming interfaces (APIs) is essential in various tech roles. APIs facilitate communication between applications, and HTTP is a foundational protocol. APIs use URLs, HTTP methods (like GET and POST), query parameters, headers, response codes, and response bodies. HTTP headers carry technical details, including cookies for user sessions. Response codes indicate request outcomes, while response bodies hold data. Authorization methods include sessions and API keys. APIs often use JSON or XML for data exchange. Different API architectures, like REST (Representational State Transfer) and GraphQL, offer distinct approaches to structuring endpoints and data interaction.<br>

Twelve South's Curve SE is similar in design to the standard Curve, but it is more affordable, coming in at $20 less. It has the same benefits and a sleek, aluminum design, but it does not feature the same black or white matte finish as the original.

There was a large audience assembled on the 14th of January, 1862, at the session of the Royal Geographical Society, No. 3 Waterloo Place, London. The president, Sir Francis M——, made an important communication to his colleagues, in an address that was frequently interrupted by applause.
