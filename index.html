            <b>Published:</b> 2023-06-23 21:54:18+00:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Most startups, especially in Web3, are made by tech guys and extremely fast. There are no brand or marketing experts, but they must start communicating with potential users on social media or at events. If you start your public communications process, you can find that it needs a clear branding, marketing and communication strategy.

In this article, I explain how early-stage Web3 startups can work with a brand strategy and what to do if your budget is limited.

Brand strategy is closely related to business strategy and affects product and user interaction. Before building a brand, I recommend identifying people's needs for your product. 

Start selling, evaluate scaling opportunities, and only in case of success, spend money on branding and marketing. Otherwise, you will get an attractive picture that will not have a proven business model.<br>

            Researchers from Microsoft have demonstrated that InAs-Al hybrid devices can pass the topological gap protocol. This is a stringent test that is used to determine whether a device is in a topological superconducting phase, which is a state of matter that could host Majorana zero modes. Majoranazero modes are exotic particles that are their own antiparticles. They have potential applications in quantum computing and cryptography.<br>

<p>The Feature Systems team at Etsy is responsible for the platform and services through which machine learning (ML) practitioners create, manage and consume feature data for their machine learning models. We recently made new real-time features available through our streaming feature platform, Rivulet, where we return things like “most recent add-to-carts.” While timeseries data itself wasn’t new to our system, these newer features from our streaming feature service would be the first timeseries inputs to be supplied to our ML models themselves to inform search, ads, and recommendations use cases.</p>
<p>Not too long after we made these features available to users for ML model training, we received a message from Harshal, an ML practitioner on Recommendations, warning us of "major problems" lying in wait.

            "Thanks be, I'm done with geometry, learning or teaching it," said Anne Shirley, a trifle vindictively, as she thumped a somewhat battered volume of Euclid into a big chest of books, banged the lid in triumph, and sat down upon it, looking at Diana Wright across the Green Gables garret, with gray eyes that were like a morning sky.
The garret was a shadowy, suggestive, delightful place, as all garrets should be. Through the open window, by which Anne sat, blew the sweet, scented, sun-warm air of the August afternoon; outside, poplar boughs rustled and tossed in the wind; beyond them were the woods, where Lover's Lane wound its enchanted path, and the old apple orchard which still bore its rosy harvests munificently. And, over all, was a great mountain range of snowy clouds in the blue southern sky. Through the other window was glimpsed a distant, white-capped, blue sea—the beautiful St. Lawrence Gulf, on which floats, like a jewel, Abegweit, whose softer, sweeter Indian name has long been forsaken for the more [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In macOS Sonoma, Apple has changed the widgets landscape. No longer do widgets have to be hidden offscreen and largely forgotten in the Notifications Center panel. Now they live right on your desktop – and they're interactive, too.

<br/>
It's worth noting from the off that widgets can still be parked in Notification Center, but now they can also be dragged out onto the desktop. The first widget can be placed anywhere, then Apple provides placement guidance for subsequent widgets by displaying a widget-shaped outline, indicating where they can be snapped into position in relation to the others.
