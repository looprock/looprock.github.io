Spotify is sending out emails to customers who will see their subscription prices go up.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iOS 26, currently in beta, gives you two distinct ways to add websites to your iPhone's Home screen – as web apps or traditional bookmarks. They might look similar at first glance, but choosing the right option can dramatically improve how you access your favorite sites.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1013154" height="1708" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/Add-to-Home-Screen-dark-scaled.jpg" width="2560"/>
<br/>
<h2>Understanding the Difference</h2>
<br/>
When you add a website to your Home screen via Safari's "Add to Home Screen" option, iOS 26 automatically detects whether the site supports progressive web app (PWA) functionality. Web apps run almost like native apps, with features like offline access, push notifications, and a streamlined interface without Safari's address bar. In contrast, traditional bookmarks simply open the website in Safari when tapped.

This choice matters more than you might think. Web apps can provide a faster, [...]<br>

            Missing the familiar Safari design from iOS 18? In iOS 26, currently in beta, Apple has learned from past criticism and made it easy to ditch the new Compact layout in favor of the classic tab layouts you may well prefer.
<br/>

<br/>
iOS 26 introduces a new "Compact" Safari design as the default, but Apple has included two additional layout options that essentially restore the iOS 18 experience. Here's how to get your old Safari back in just a few taps.

<em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=38912">The Elec</a></em> reports that Apple has set a two-year production plan for the superior OLED technology to be adapted for iPhone models. However, Apple has yet to decide whether to develop the panels in partnership with Samsung Display or LG Display, suggesting iPhones with tandem OLED won't arrive until sometime after 2028.

            Along with the iPhone 18 Fold expected to launch in late 2026, Apple is working on a larger-screened foldable device that could be a MacBook-iPad hybrid of some sort. According to one analyst, both devices were set to enter mass production towards the end of next year, but a new report now suggests the larger model is further away than originally thought.

Instead, Pu reserves his excitement for the iPhone 18 Fold, for which he has seen "intact progress" in the supply chain pointing to a release in the second half of 2026.

"Apple Cinemas is knowingly and intentionally using the name Apple to sow confusion for its own benefit," alleged attorneys for Apple, in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.287536/gov.uscourts.mad.287536.1.0.pdf">complaint</a> filed against all Apple Cinemas locations, and a Sand Media Corp Inc. company connected to the chain.

Established in 2013, Apple Cinemas maintained a limited presence in the Northeastern U.S. until last month, when it opened a theater in San Francisco.

Like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, macOS Tahoe adopts the Liquid Glass design. It's used for the Dock, widgets, Control Center, menu bars, navigation bars in apps, app icons, and a few other places, but its implementation is less widespread than it is in iOS and iPadOS. It's clear that Liquid Glass was not a Mac-first design, and the glass parts of the interface feel cobbled together with the previous design language.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            CalDigit recently came out with the TS5 Plus, which is designed to work with Apple's Thunderbolt 5 Macs.

<br/>
The TS5 Plus looks like CalDigit's prior docks, featuring a simple rectangular shape and an aluminum build with some ridging at the top, bottom, and sides for visual interest and heat dissipation.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a black aluminum color that matches the Space Black of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macbook-pro/">M4 MacBook Pro</a> models, and it comes with a hefty 330W power brick. In fact, the power brick is longer than the dock itself, but it's flat and tucks away under a desk fairly well. The TS5 Plus is six inches long, five inches wide, and 1.8 inches thick, while the power brick is seven inches long, 3.5 inches wide, and a little under an inch thick.

Apple updated the list to move the Series 1 Apple Watch models from the vintage section to the obsolete section, as it has now been more than seven years since the devices were last offered for sale.
