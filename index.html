            <b>Published:</b> 2025-05-13 08:59:41-07:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Remotely controlling the shutter on your iPhone's camera lets you include yourself in the photo while avoiding the limitations of a selfie. For example, it allows you to take a picture of a wider scene with you included in the frame, which is ideal for landscape shots or group photos. If your iPhone is on a tripod, taking the shot remotely also reduces the risk of camera shake. Here's how to do it – and you don't need an Apple Watch.

There are more ways than one to take a picture on your iPhone remotely. If you have an Apple Watch, you can open the Camera Remote app that comes included. If you don't have an Apple Watch, skip to our Voice Control steps.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Foreign-branded smartphone shipments in China, dominated by Apple's iPhone, dropped dramatically in March 2025, plunging 49.6% year-over-year according to data released by The China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT).

<br/>
The steep decline saw shipments fall to just 1.89 million units, down from 3.75 million during the same period last year. That shrinks Apple's share of the Chinese market to approximately 8%, while domestic brands now control 92% of smartphone shipments.
<br/>
<br/>
For the entire first quarter, non-Chinese brand shipments declined over 25%, while total smartphone shipments in China actually increased by 3.3%.

            Samsung today introduced the <a href="https://howl.link/chaeu38jiafc4">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, an ultra thin smartphone that will compete with Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> "Air." The Galaxy S25 Edge features a 6.7-inch AMOLED display and it measures in at 5.8mm thick.

            With Safari 18.5, included in macOS 15.5, Apple <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/16923/webkit-features-in-safari-18-5/">added Declarative Web Push</a>, an updated method to deliver web-based push notifications even when a website isn't open. With Declarative Web Push, developers can display notifications without the need for a service worker, which preserves battery life for Web Push notifications.

Declarative Web Push <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/16923/webkit-features-in-safari-18-5/">is more energy efficient</a>, and it's also more private and easier for developers to implement. It does not rely on JavaScript, instead using a standardized JSON format that lets browsers directly display notifications without additional code.

According to Apple's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/122404">security support document</a> for iOS 18.5, there's a fix for a vulnerability with the C1 modem. Apple says that it addressed a baseband security flaw that could allow an attacker "in a privileged network position" to intercept network traffic. Basically, a hacker that had access to cellular network infrastructure could potentially exploit the vulnerability for surveillance or to employ a man-in-the-middle attack.

            Although originally written in 2018, the following concepts remain essential for developers working with concurrency. This blogpost focuses on concurrency, distinguishing it from parallelism by defining it as &ldquo;out of order&rdquo; execution. It emphasizes the importance of understanding workload types—CPU bound (e.g., summing, sorting) and IO bound (e.g., file reading)—to assess when concurrency is appropriate. Through practical examples and benchmarks, it shows that parallelism boosts performance for CPU bound tasks, while concurrency alone benefits IO bound workloads.<br>
