            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Across 2024 and the early months of 2025, Apple refreshed all of its Macs with next-generation M4 chips, with the exception of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a>.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Earlier this week, the investment firm GF Securities shared multiple research notes regarding Apple's future chips. In one of these notes, it said the A20 chip for the iPhone 18 series would be manufactured <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/a20-chip-still-3nm-rumor/">with TSMC's third-generation 3nm process</a>, N3P, and in another it said that the chip would use TSMC's newer 2nm process N2.

<br/>
GF Securities is a large organization with many analysts, and it seems like some wires got crossed. In an email to <em>MacRumors</em>, the firm's lead Apple analyst Jeff Pu has since clarified that he believes the A20 chip will be manufactured with the N2 process, so the information about the chip using the N3P process should be disregarded.

Dickson points out that the iPhone 17 Pro dummy models feature an outlined area on the back, beginning just below the camera module and extending to the bottom of the chassis. Dickson says this is "where the glass will change."

The new perk is the ability to create invitations in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-invites/id6472498645">Apple Invites app</a> for the iPhone, which <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/04/apple-launches-new-invites-app/">launched in the App Store last month</a>.
