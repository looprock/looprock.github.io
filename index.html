            <b>Published:</b> 2026-02-22 10:22:00+01:00<p>
            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            <p>Most organizations treat infrastructure as a series of projects to be &ldquo;completed,&rdquo; but successful platform engineering requires a permanent product mindset. In this episode, we explore why platform teams need dedicated product management to balance competing priorities—like security, cost, and developer experience—and why the &ldquo;why&rdquo; scales much better than the &ldquo;what&rdquo; in large enterprises. We also dive into the often-overlooked role of designers in creating platform tools that developers actually want to use.</p>
<p>Tanzu Catsup is a weekly conversation about platform engineering, cloud-native operations, and building software in large organizations. We follow the work wherever it actually leads.</p>
