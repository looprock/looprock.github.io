From there, if you drag a file like a photo from Mac to the open <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app on the ‌iPhone‌, it'll transfer over. If you want to transfer a PDF, just open the Files app and then drag the PDF [...]<br>

            With the fifth beta of iOS 18.1, Apple has made a small tweak to the Camera Control button that was introduced on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a>, and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max.

When you dig into the Camera Control settings, there is now a way to set it to the front-facing camera without having to interact with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s display.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            iMessage and FaceTime are acting up for some users, according to <a href="https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/">Apple's system status page</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" height="1407" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" width="2500"/>
<br/>
Some users are "experiencing a problem" with iMessage and FaceTime, the page says. Apple says it is "investigating" and will provide a status update when possible.
<br/>
<br/>
The issues began shortly after 5 a.m. Pacific Time, according to Apple.
<br/>
<br/>
At this time, there does not appear to be a widespread iMessage or FaceTime outage. Instead, the services are experiencing "performance" issues, according to Apple. We'll update this story when Apple's system status page says the issues are resolved.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In iOS 17, Apple doesn't offer a system-level method for individually locking sensitive apps like Photos behind Face ID. There is a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/automatically-lock-iphone-app-opened/">Shortcut action</a> that provides rudimentary protection, but it's not infallible. Thankfully, iOS 18 includes a dedicated option to lock and even hide individual apps even when the iPhone itself is already unlocked.
