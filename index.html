            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Christie's is preparing to auction off the original partnership contract that created the Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, valuing it in the region of $2-4 million.  
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028240" height="2160" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/apple-computer-corporate-founding-documents@2x.jpg" width="3840"/>
<br/>
The original three-page document served as the contract among Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ron Wayne. The agreement established initial shares at 45% for Jobs, 45% for Wozniak, and 10% for Wayne.
<br/>
<br/>
Additional papers documenting Wayne's withdrawal as a partner just 12 days after the company was formed are also included in the auction package. Wayne initially received $800 for his 10% share of the company, and later received an additional $1,500 payment.

Wayne later stated he withdrew because he knew the venture would be a "roller coaster" and that the high-stakes ride was not for him. [...]<br>

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            OpenAI has updated the voice feature in its ChatGPT app so that voice conversations now happen directly inside an ongoing chat instead of forcing users into a separate voice-only session.
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028081" height="1125" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/openai-chatgpt-logo.jpg" width="2000"/>
<br/>
The change means responses <a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1993381101369458763?s=20">now appear in real-time with text</a> – plus any visuals like images and maps – as you speak, making switching between voice and text smoother while preserving chat history and context.
<br/>
<br/>
Previously, when you used "Advanced Voice Mode," voice chats opened in their own window, which would exit your current conversation and knock you out of your workflow. The update means voice and text interactions are now integrated in one seamless conversation thread.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Singapore has ordered Apple to block or filter messages on iMessage that impersonate government agencies, requiring the company to implement new anti-spoofing protections by December as part of efforts to curb rising online scams, the <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/spore-orders-google-apple-to-curb-government-impersonation-on-messaging-services"><em>Straits Times</em></a> reports.

Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said that it had issued an Implementation Directive to Apple under the Online Criminal Harms Act, instructing the company to prevent iMessage accounts and group chats from using names that mimic Singapore government agencies or the "gov.sg" sender ID. The directive also applies to Google Messages, with both companies required to comply by November 30.

<br/>
The report links pressure from major record labels on both Spotify and Apple Music to raise subscription prices. They argue prices have lagged inflation, while subscriptions remain cheap compared to video services such as Netflix.
<br/>
<br/>
Wall Street analysts say the price increase is critical to Spotify's stock, as the company pushes to show profitability. JPMorgan analysts have projected a $1-a-month price rise would boost Spotify's annual revenue by $500 million.

<p>There is a lot that rings true about this suggestion. Consider the following intuitive, common sense ideas: if we let immigrants come here and work, they’ll take our jobs; we should levy taxes on imports to help protect our economy from foreign competition; crime can only be controlled by getting tough on criminals. These ideas may be true or false, but the point is that they all have populist appeal, and they all seem kind of obvious.</p>
<p>The elite consensus is that these ideas are also wrong. But to reach that conclusion requires considerable time and effort to sift through the evidence or work through the theory.
