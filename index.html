            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            In macOS, you can easily convert the format of images using a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/convert-images-macos-finder/">Quick Action</a> in Finder or you can achieve the same thing via the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/batch-convert-images-to-different-formats-using-macos-preview/">Preview app</a>, but if your daily workflow requires you to repeatedly convert images – for uploading to a blog, for example – then using a Folder Action can be a much faster way of getting the job done.

In this article, we'll show you how to use the macOS Automator app to create a very simple Folder Action that will automatically convert images dropped into a specific folder, without you having to manually apply a Quick Action or open an image editing app. Keep reading to learn how it's done.

<br/>
Without protections of encryption, an attacker on the same Wi-Fi network could redirect a user's browser to a clone phishing site where login details could be stolen. The vulnerability was first discovered by developer Mysk's security researchers and reported in September.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Along with a foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, Apple is working on a larger foldable device that's somewhere around 19 inches, but rumors have been split on whether it's an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> or a Mac. Some reports refer to the device as an ‌iPad‌, while some call it a Mac, and the split seems to come down to the operating system on the device.

<br/>
<h2>Is it a Mac?</h2>
<br/>
Some rumors have suggested that Apple is developing a foldable MacBook with an all-display design. The MacBook already has a foldable design, of course, but the difference here would be a single display without an included keyboard and trackpad.

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
            Apple today stopped signing iOS 18.3.1, so <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users who have upgraded to iOS 18.3.2 are no longer able to downgrade to the prior version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>. Apple released iOS 18.3.2 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/11/apple-releases-ios-18-3-2/">on March 10</a>.

<br/>
It is not unusual for Apple to stop signing older versions of iOS after releasing an update. Software that is not signed cannot be installed on an ‌iPhone‌ due to a server-side verification check, and it keeps ‌iPhone‌ users from installing outdated versions of iOS. ‌iPhone‌ models compatible with ‌iOS 18‌ are only eligible to download and run iOS 18.3.2 at this time.
